The color is based off the flax plant, a pale golden crop that grows in fields and waves in the wind. The color is subtle but striking, the gold almost reminding one of a crown fit for royalty.</td>

            <td>This shade of white is a really unique color. It has a base of white with cooler tones of yellows, greens, and grays mingling together. The web color is based off the mineral alabaster, a soft rock that is often used in sculpting. It is also used to produce plaster, making the color familiar to most people.

            <td>Much like its namesake, this memorable shade of white has a background that&#8217;s just slightly stormy. As you can see by its CMYK values, Unresolved Problem has more black than yellow, which helps create its distinctive undertones.</td>

            <td>Paper White isn&#8217;t exactly true to its name. Most paper is a very bright, stark white. Or at most, it&#8217;s a creamy off-white. Paper White is somewhat unusual in that it doesn&#8217;t have any yellow or black present, but it does have some level of cyan and magenta. It&#8217;s an ideal option if you like some of the bluish shades on the list but need something even more dilute.</td>

            <td>Pearls come in all kinds of different colors, and Pacific Pearl is roughly the color of a silver-gray pearl. It&#8217;s somewhat interesting in that it has cyan, yellow, and black present, but no magenta.</td>

            <td>As its name suggests, Night White looks a lot like the color white does under the cover of night. Its grayish tinge still manages to be fairly energetic thanks to its small burst of yellow.</td>

            <td>Delicate White is a very well-named shade. It&#8217;s close to being true white with just a bit of wispy gray. It also has a decent balance of red, green, and blue, and it&#8217;s a highly versatile shade.</td>

            <td>This shade looks a good bit like its namesake. It has a bit of a golden-brown undertone, but it&#8217;s still pale enough to be considered a shade of white. It&#8217;s an excellent choice if you&#8217;d like a slightly tinted white that&#8217;s brownish instead of grayish.</td>

This color, Green Lizard, is roughly the color of an anole, which is a small green lizard. Though Green Lizard is fairly bright, it stops short of being neon, making it much easier to look at.</td>

The name comes from the Pullman Company, a railroad car manufacturer that operated during the American railroad boom. Its cars were painted this very deep olive green. Originally, the cars were painted chocolate brown. Once the official color was changed to Pullman Green (originally called Brewster Green), the cars continued to be painted in Pullman Green until the company went out of business.</td>

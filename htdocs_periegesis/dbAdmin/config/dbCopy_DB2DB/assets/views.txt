View definitions are stored in INFORMATION_SCHEMA table.

SELECT VIEW_DEFINITION FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.VIEWS WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'viewnamehere'
if you have created a view 'xyz' and after some time you have modified this view then this above query will show both query that was used to create view and query to modify view.

If you want just latest view query then you can simply run:

SHOW CREATE VIEW 'viewnamehere'
This query will show you all information about view like character_set_client, collation_connection , DEFINER etc.



For the purposes of recreating the query used to create your view and for the purposes of backing up all views, I found the following:

Dump all views:

select CONCAT('CREATE or REPLACE VIEW ',table_name,' AS ',view_definition,';') from information_schema.views;
Dump views from only a specific DB:

select CONCAT('CREATE or REPLACE VIEW ',table_name,' AS ',view_definition,';') from information_schema.views WHERE table_schema = '$DB_NAME';



Create View
 CREATE view productlist AS SELECT brand.brand_name, product.product_name FROM brand INNER JOIN product ON product.brand_id = brand.brand_id  
Update View
 CREATE OR REPLACE view productlist AS SELECT brand.brand_id, brand.brand_name, product.product_name FROM brand INNER JOIN product ON product.brand_id = brand.brand_id

The earliest <pl id='Q1412043' data-wiki='Phlius' title='Phlious (Korinthia)'>Phliasians</pl> named the goddess to whom the sanctuary belongs Ganymeda; but later authorities call her <prn id='Q131125' data-wiki='Hebe_(mythology)' title='Hebe (d. of Zeus)'>Hebe</prn>, whom <prn id='Q6691' data-wiki='Homer' title='Homer (poet) '>Homer</prn> mentions in the duel between <prn id='Q171839' data-wiki='Menelaus' title='Menelaus (s. of Atreus)'>Menelaus</prn> and <prn id='Q167646' data-wiki='Paris_(mythology)' title='Paris/Alexandros (s. of Priam)'>Alexander</prn>, saying that she was the cup-bearer of the gods; and again he says, in the descent of <prn id='Q47231' data-wiki='Odysseus' title='Odysseus (s. of Laertes), Ulysses'>Odysseus</prn> to <pl id='Q1521549' data-wiki='Greek_underworld' title='Hades (Underworld)'>Hades</pl>, that she was the wife of <prn id='Q122248' data-wiki='Heracles' title='Heracles (s. of Zeus), Hercules'>Heracles</prn>. <prn id='Q978308' data-wiki='Olen_(poet)' title='Olen (poet)'>Olen</prn>, in his hymn to <prn id='Q38012' data-wiki='Hera' title='Hera (d. of Cronus), Juno'>Hera</prn>, says that <prn id='Q38012' data-wiki='Hera' title='Hera (d. of Cronus), Juno'>Hera</prn> was reared by the <prn id='Q201411' data-wiki='Horae' title='Horae, the Seasons'>Seasons</prn>, and that her children were <prn id='Q40901' data-wiki='Ares' title='Ares (s. of Zeus), Mars'>Ares</prn> and <prn id='Q131125' data-wiki='Hebe_(mythology)' title='Hebe (d. of Zeus)'>Hebe</prn>. Of the honors that the <pl id='Q1412043' data-wiki='Phlius' title='Phlious (Korinthia)'>Phliasians</pl> pay to this goddess the greatest is the pardoning of suppliants. </p>
<p id='2.13.4'><b>2.13.4</b> All those who seek sanctuary here receive full forgiveness, and prisoners, when set free, dedicate their fetters on the trees in the grove. The <pl id='Q1412043' data-wiki='Phlius' title='Phlious (Korinthia)'>Phliasians</pl> also celebrate a yearly festival which they call Ivy-cutters. There is no image, either kept in secret or openly displayed, and the reason for this is set forth in a sacred legend of theirs though on the left as you go out is a temple of <prn id='Q38012' data-wiki='Hera' title='Hera (d. of Cronus), Juno'>Hera</prn> with an image of <prn id='Q2052367' data-wiki='Parian_marble' title='Parian marble'>Parian marble</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.13.5'><b>2.13.5</b> On the acropolis is another enclosure, which is sacred to <prn id='Q40730' data-wiki='Demeter' title='Demeter, Deo'>Demeter</prn>, and in it are a temple and statue of <prn id='Q40730' data-wiki='Demeter' title='Demeter, Deo'>Demeter</prn> and her daughter. Here there is also a bronze statue of <prn id='Q39503' data-wiki='Artemis' title='Artemis (d. of Zeus), Diana'>Artemis</prn>, which appeared to me to be ancient. As you go down from the acropolis you see on the right a temple of <prn id='Q83223' data-wiki='Asclepius' title='Asclepius (s. of Apollo) Asklepios, Aesculapius'>Asclepius</prn> with an image of the god as a beardless youth. Below this temple is built a theater. Not far from it is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q40730' data-wiki='Demeter' title='Demeter, Deo'>Demeter</prn> and old, seated images. </p>
<p id='2.13.6'><b>2.13.6</b> On the agora is a votive offering, a bronze she-<prn id='Q2934' data-wiki='Goat' title='Goats'>goat</prn> for the most part covered with gold. The following is the reason why it has received honors among the <pl id='Q1412043' data-wiki='Phlius' title='Phlious (Korinthia)'>Phliasians</pl>. The constellation which they call the <prn id='Q12970' data-wiki='Capella' title='Capella'>Goat</prn> on its rising causes continual damage to the vines. In order that they may suffer nothing unpleasant from it, the <pl id='Q1412043' data-wiki='Phlius' title='Phlious (Korinthia)'>Phliasians</pl> pay honors to the bronze <prn id='Q2934' data-wiki='Goat' title='Goats'>goat</prn> on the agora and adorn the image with gold. Here also is the tomb of <prn id='Q3622659' data-wiki='Aristias' title='Aristias (playwright)'>Aristias</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q1362371' data-wiki='Pratinas' title='Pratinas (playwright)'>Pratinas</prn>.

<p id='2.13.7'><b>2.13.7</b> Behind the agora is a building which the <pl id='Q1412043' data-wiki='Phlius' title='Phlious (Korinthia)'>Phliasians</pl> name the House of Divination. Into it <prn id='Q330584' data-wiki='Amphiaraus' title='Amphiaraus (s. of Oicles)'>Amphiaraus</prn> entered, slept the night there, and then first, say the <pl id='Q1412043' data-wiki='Phlius' title='Phlious (Korinthia)'>Phliasians</pl>, began to divine. According to their account <prn id='Q330584' data-wiki='Amphiaraus' title='Amphiaraus (s. of Oicles)'>Amphiaraus</prn> was for a time an ordinary person and no diviner. Ever since that time the building has been shut up. Not far away is what is called the Omphalos (Navel), the center of all the <pl id='Q78967' data-wiki='Peloponnese' title='Peloponnese (Hellas)'>Peloponnesus</pl>, if they speak the truth about it. Farther on from the Omphalos they have an old sanctuary of <prn id='Q41680' data-wiki='Dionysus' title='Dionysus (s. of Zeus), Bacchus'>Dionysus</prn>, a sanctuary of <prn id='Q37340' data-wiki='Apollo' title='Apollo (s. of Zeus) (cf Phoebus)'>Apollo</prn>, and one of <prn id='Q79876' data-wiki='Isis' title='Isis (goddess)'>Isis</prn>. The image of <prn id='Q41680' data-wiki='Dionysus' title='Dionysus (s. of Zeus), Bacchus'>Dionysus</prn> is visible to all, and so also is that of <prn id='Q37340' data-wiki='Apollo' title='Apollo (s. of Zeus) (cf Phoebus)'>Apollo</prn>, but the image of <prn id='Q79876' data-wiki='Isis' title='Isis (goddess)'>Isis</prn> only the priests may behold. </p>
<p id='2.13.8'><b>2.13.8</b> The <pl id='Q1412043' data-wiki='Phlius' title='Phlious (Korinthia)'>Phliasians</pl> tell also the following legend.

While he was staying there <prn id='Q749966' data-wiki='Oeneus' title='Oeneus (s. of Porthaon)'>Oeneus</prn> came to him from <pl id='Q26857' data-wiki='Aetolia' title='Aitolia region (Aitolia)'>Aetolia</pl>. He had already allied himself to the family of <prn id='Q122248' data-wiki='Heracles' title='Heracles (s. of Zeus), Hercules'>Heracles</prn>, and after his arrival on this occasion either he entertained <prn id='Q122248' data-wiki='Heracles' title='Heracles (s. of Zeus), Hercules'>Heracles</prn> or <prn id='Q122248' data-wiki='Heracles' title='Heracles (s. of Zeus), Hercules'>Heracles</prn> entertained him. Be this as it may, displeased with the drink given him <prn id='Q122248' data-wiki='Heracles' title='Heracles (s. of Zeus), Hercules'>Heracles</prn> struck on the head with one of his fingers the boy <prn id='Q12879770' title='Cyathus - cupbearer killed by Heracles'>Cyathus</prn>, the cup-bearer of <prn id='Q749966' data-wiki='Oeneus' title='Oeneus (s. of Porthaon)'>Oeneus</prn>, who died on the spot from the blow. A chapel keeps the memory of the deed fresh among the <pl id='Q1412043' data-wiki='Phlius' title='Phlious (Korinthia)'>Phliasians</pl>; it is built by the side of the sanctuary of <prn id='Q37340' data-wiki='Apollo' title='Apollo (s. of Zeus) (cf Phoebus)'>Apollo</prn>, and it contains statues made of stone representing Cyathus holding out a cup to <prn id='Q122248' data-wiki='Heracles' title='Heracles (s. of Zeus), Hercules'>Heracles</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.14.1'><b>2.14.1</b> <pl id='Q115380594' title='Celeae (Peloponnese)'>Celeae</pl> is some five stades distant from the city, and here they celebrate the mysteries in honor of <prn id='Q40730' data-wiki='Demeter' title='Demeter, Deo'>Demeter</prn>, not every year but every fourth year. The <prn id='Q1443775' data-wiki='Hierophant' title='hierophant'>hierophant</prn> is not appointed for life, but at each celebration they elect a fresh one, who takes, if he cares to do so, a wife. In this respect their custom differs from that at <pl id='Q94299853' title='Eleusinian Demeter sanctuary (Attica)'>Eleusis</pl>, but the actual celebration is modelled on the <pl id='Q94299853' title='Eleusinian Demeter sanctuary (Attica)'>Eleusinian</pl> rites. The <pl id='Q1412043' data-wiki='Phlius' title='Phlious (Korinthia)'>Phliasians</pl> themselves admit that they copy the “performance” at <pl id='Q94299853' title='Eleusinian Demeter sanctuary (Attica)'>Eleusis</pl>. </p>
<p id='2.14.2'><b>2.14.2</b> They say that it was <prn id='Q4162118' title='Dysaules  - mythical importer of the Eleusinian mysteries to Phlius'>Dysaules</prn>, the brother of <prn id='Q1141300' data-wiki='Celeus' title='Celeus (s. of Rarus)'>Celeus</prn>, who came to their land and established the mysteries, and that he had been expelled from <pl id='Q11918833' title='Eleusis (Attica)'>Eleusis</pl> by <prn id='Q853462' data-wiki='Ion_(mythology)' title='Ion (s. of Xuthus and Athenian/Ionian leader) '>Ion</prn>, when <prn id='Q853462' data-wiki='Ion_(mythology)' title='Ion (s. of Xuthus and Athenian/Ionian leader) '>Ion</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q514746' data-wiki='Xuthus' title='Xuthus'>Xuthus</prn>, was chosen by the <pl id='Q844930' data-wiki='Classical_Athens' title='Athens (Attica)'>Athenians</pl> to be commander-in-chief in the <pl id='Q11918833' title='Eleusis (Attica)'>Eleusinian</pl> war. Now I cannot possibly agree with the <pl id='Q1412043' data-wiki='Phlius' title='Phlious (Korinthia)'>Phliasians</pl> in supposing that an <pl id='Q11918833' title='Eleusis (Attica)'>Eleusinian</pl> was conquered in battle and driven away into exile, for the war terminated in a treaty before it was fought out, and <prn id='Q1125049' data-wiki='Eumolpus' title='Eumolpus of Thrace'>Eumolpus</prn> himself remained at <pl id='Q11918833' title='Eleusis (Attica)'>Eleusis</pl>. </p>
<p id='2.14.3'><b>2.14.3</b> But it is possible that <prn id='Q4162118' title='Dysaules  - mythical importer of the Eleusinian mysteries to Phlius'>Dysaules</prn> came to <pl id='Q1412043' data-wiki='Phlius' title='Phlious (Korinthia)'>Phlius</pl> for some other reason than that given by the <pl id='Q1412043' data-wiki='Phlius' title='Phlious (Korinthia)'>Phliasians</pl>.

<p id='2.26.3'><b>2.26.3</b> That the land is especially sacred to <prn id='Q83223' data-wiki='Asclepius' title='Asclepius (s. of Apollo) Asklepios, Aesculapius'>Asclepius</prn> is due to the following reason. The <pl id='Q233576' data-wiki='Epidaurus' title='Epidauros (Argolid)'>Epidaurians</pl> say that <prn id='Q831583' data-wiki='Phlegyas' title='Phlegyas (s. of Ares)'>Phlegyas</prn> came to the <pl id='Q78967' data-wiki='Peloponnese' title='Peloponnese (Hellas)'>Peloponnesus</pl>, ostensibly to see the land, but really to spy out the number of the inhabitants, and whether the greater part of them was warlike.

<p id='2.26.4'><b>2.26.4</b> When he went to the <pl id='Q78967' data-wiki='Peloponnese' title='Peloponnese (Hellas)'>Peloponnesus</pl>, he was accompanied by his daughter, who all along had kept hidden from her father that she was with child by <prn id='Q37340' data-wiki='Apollo' title='Apollo (s. of Zeus) (cf Phoebus)'>Apollo</prn>. In the country of the <pl id='Q233576' data-wiki='Epidaurus' title='Epidauros (Argolid)'>Epidaurians</pl> she bore a son, and exposed him on the mountain called <pl id='Q109941874' title='Titthium Mt.

As the child lay exposed he was given milk by one of the <prn id='Q2934' data-wiki='Goat' title='Goats'>goats</prn> that pastured about the mountain, and was guarded by the watch-<prn id='Q144' data-wiki='Dog' title='Dogs'>dog</prn> of the herd. </p>

As he drew near he saw lightning that flashed from the child, and, thinking that it was something divine, as in fact it was, he turned away. Presently it was reported over every land and sea that <prn id='Q83223' data-wiki='Asclepius' title='Asclepius (s. of Apollo) Asklepios, Aesculapius'>Asclepius</prn> was discovering everything he wished to heal the sick, and that he was raising dead men to life. </p>

<p id='2.29.6'><b>2.29.6</b> Of the Greek islands, <pl id='Q57394139' title='Aigina polis (Aegina)'>Aegina</pl> is the most difficult of access, for it is surrounded by sunken rocks and reefs which rise up.

<p id='2.31.1'><b>2.31.1</b> In the agora of <pl id='Q581494' data-wiki='Troezen' title='Troizen (Troizenia)'>Troezen</pl> is a temple of <prn id='Q39503' data-wiki='Artemis' title='Artemis (d. of Zeus), Diana'>Artemis</prn> <prn id='Q2303797' data-wiki='Soter' title='Saviour/Soter'>Saviour</prn>, with images of the goddess.

This victory he considered the most noteworthy of his achievements, not so much, in my opinion, because <prn id='Q42372544' title='Asterius - mythical son of Minos'>Asterion</prn> was the bravest of those killed by <prn id='Q1320718' data-wiki='Theseus' title='Theseus (s. of Aegeus)'>Theseus</prn>, but because his success in unravelling the difficult <pl id='Q1091243' title='Labyrinth (Crete)'>Labyrinth</pl> and in escaping unnoticed after the exploit made credible the saying that it was divine providence that brought <prn id='Q1320718' data-wiki='Theseus' title='Theseus (s. of Aegeus)'>Theseus</prn> and his company back in safety. </p>
<p id='2.31.2'><b>2.31.2</b> In this temple are altars to the gods said to rule under the earth. It is here that they say <prn id='Q776139' data-wiki='Semele' title='Semele (d. of Cadmus)'>Semele</prn> was brought out of Hades by <prn id='Q41680' data-wiki='Dionysus' title='Dionysus (s. of Zeus), Bacchus'>Dionysus</prn>, and that <prn id='Q122248' data-wiki='Heracles' title='Heracles (s. of Zeus), Hercules'>Heracles</prn> dragged up the <prn id='Q83496' data-wiki='Cerberus' title='Cerberus (s. of Typhon)'>hound of Hades</prn>. But I cannot bring myself to believe even that <prn id='Q776139' data-wiki='Semele' title='Semele (d. of Cadmus)'>Semele</prn> died at all, seeing that she was the wife of <prn id='Q34201' data-wiki='Zeus' title='Zeus (s. of Cronus), Jupiter'>Zeus</prn>; while, as for the so-called <prn id='Q83496' data-wiki='Cerberus' title='Cerberus (s. of Typhon)'>hound of Hades</prn>, I will give my views in another place. </p>
<p id='2.31.3'><b>2.31.3</b> Behind the temple is the tomb of <prn id='Q750580' data-wiki='Pittheus' title='Pittheus (s. of Pelops)'>Pittheus</prn>, on which are placed three seats of white marble. On them they say that <prn id='Q750580' data-wiki='Pittheus' title='Pittheus (s. of Pelops)'>Pittheus</prn> and two men with him used to sit in judgment. Not far off is a sanctuary of the <prn id='Q66016' data-wiki='Muses' title='Muses (goddesses)'>Muses</prn>, made, they told me, by <prn id='Q3621840' data-wiki='Ardalus' title='Ardalus'>Ardalus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q44384' data-wiki='Hephaestus' title='Hephaestus, Vulcan, (s. of Zeus)'>Hephaestus</prn>.

Here, they say, <prn id='Q750580' data-wiki='Pittheus' title='Pittheus (s. of Pelops)'>Pittheus</prn> taught the art of rhetoric, and I have myself read a book purporting to be a treatise by <prn id='Q750580' data-wiki='Pittheus' title='Pittheus (s. of Pelops)'>Pittheus</prn>, published by a citizen of <pl id='Q233576' data-wiki='Epidaurus' title='Epidauros (Argolid)'>Epidaurus</pl>. Not far from the Mouseion is an old altar, which also, according to report, was dedicated by <prn id='Q3621840' data-wiki='Ardalus' title='Ardalus'>Ardalus</prn>.

Perhaps there may be another explanation that I am unaware of. The stone in front of the temple, called the Sacred Stone, they say is that on which nine men of <pl id='Q581494' data-wiki='Troezen' title='Troizen (Troizenia)'>Troezen</pl> once purified <prn id='Q192407' data-wiki='Orestes' title='Orestes (s. of Agamemnon)'>Orestes</prn> from the stain of matricide. </p>

<p id='2.31.8'><b>2.31.8</b> In front of the sanctuary of <prn id='Q37340' data-wiki='Apollo' title='Apollo (s. of Zeus) (cf Phoebus)'>Apollo</prn> is a building called the Skene (booth) of <prn id='Q192407' data-wiki='Orestes' title='Orestes (s. of Agamemnon)'>Orestes</prn>.

But the <pl id='Q13533353' title='Argos (Argolid)'>Argive</pl> account is that when <prn id='Q40730' data-wiki='Demeter' title='Demeter, Deo'>Demeter</prn> came to <pl id='Q12649101' title='Argolid region (Peloponnese)'>Argolis</pl>, while <prn id='Q55957981' title='Atheras - mythical Argive who gave hospitality to Demeter'>Atheras</prn> and <prn id='Q6948683' data-wiki='Mysius' title='Mysius'>Mysius</prn> afforded hospitality to the goddess, <prn id='Q115623962' title='Colontas - mythological Argive, spurner of Demeter and father of Chthonia'>Colontas</prn> neither received her into his home nor paid her any other mark of respect.

<p id='2.35.5'><b>2.35.5</b> At any rate, the goddess herself is called <prn id='Q57444528' title='Chthonia - epithet of Demeter'>Chthonia</prn>, and <prn id='Q11916249' title='Chthonia - ancient festival of Demeter'>Chthonia</prn> is the name of the festival they hold in the summer of every year. The manner of it is this. The procession is headed by the priests of the gods and by all those who hold the annual magistracies; these are followed by both men and women. It is now a custom that some who are still children should honor the goddess in the procession. These are dressed in white, and wear wreaths upon their heads. Their wreaths are woven of the flower called by the natives cosmosandalon, which, from its size and color, seems to me to be an iris; it even has inscribed upon it the same letters of mourning. </p>
<p id='2.35.6'><b>2.35.6</b> Those who form the procession are followed by men leading from the herd a full-grown <prn id='Q830' data-wiki='Cattle' title='Cows, Cattle'>cow</prn>, fastened with ropes, and still untamed and frisky.

Afterwards the doors are opened, and those who are appointed drive up a second <prn id='Q830' data-wiki='Cattle' title='Cows, Cattle'>cow</prn>, and a third after that, and yet a fourth. All are dispatched in the same way by the old women, and the sacrifice has yet another strange feature.

<p id='2.35.8'><b>2.35.8</b> Such is the manner in which the sacrifice is performed by the <pl id='Q58401924' data-wiki='Hermione_(Argolis)' title='Hermione (Argolid)'>Hermionians</pl>.

<p id='4.5.1'><b>4.5.1</b> The <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonians</pl> say that they went to war because <prn id='Q7226204' data-wiki='Polychares_of_Messenia' title='Polychares of Messenia '>Polychares</prn> was not surrendered to them, and on account of the murder of <prn id='Q1258032' data-wiki='Teleclus' title='Teleclus'>Teleclus</prn>; even before this they had been suspicious on account of the wrongdoing of <prn id='Q1788026' data-wiki='Cresphontes' title='Cresphontes (s. of Aristomachus)'>Cresphontes</prn> in the matter of the lot. The <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenians</pl> make the reply that I have already given with regard to <prn id='Q1258032' data-wiki='Teleclus' title='Teleclus'>Teleclus</prn>, and point to the fact that the sons of <prn id='Q666525' data-wiki='Aristodemus' title='Aristodemus (s. of Aristomachus)'>Aristodemus</prn> helped to restore <prn id='Q406443' data-wiki='Aepytus_of_Messenia' title='Aepytus of Messenia'>Aepytus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q1788026' data-wiki='Cresphontes' title='Cresphontes (s. of Aristomachus)'>Cresphontes</prn>, which they would never have done if they had been at variance with <prn id='Q1788026' data-wiki='Cresphontes' title='Cresphontes (s. of Aristomachus)'>Cresphontes</prn>. </p>
<p id='4.5.2'><b>4.5.2</b> They say that they did not surrender <prn id='Q7226204' data-wiki='Polychares_of_Messenia' title='Polychares of Messenia '>Polychares</prn> to the <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonians</pl> for punishment because they also had not surrendered <prn id='Q88461412' title='Euaephnus the Spartan - legendary figure responsible for 1st Messenian War'>Euaephnus</prn>, but that they offered to stand trial at the meeting of the league before the <pl id='Q13533353' title='Argos (Argolid)'>Argives</pl>, kinsmen of both parties, and to submit the matter to the court at <pl id='Q844930' data-wiki='Classical_Athens' title='Athens (Attica)'>Athens</pl> called the <pl id='Q202487' data-wiki='Areopagus' title='Areiopagos (Athens)'>Areopagus</pl>, as this court was held to exercise an ancient jurisdiction in cases pertaining to murder. </p>
<p id='4.5.3'><b>4.5.3</b> They say that these were not the reasons of the <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonians</pl> in going to war, but that they had formed designs on their country through covetousness, as in others of their actions, bringing forward against them their treatment of the <pl id='Q12898802' data-wiki='Arcadia_(region)' title='Arkadia region (Arkadia)'>Arcadians</pl> and of the <pl id='Q13533353' title='Argos (Argolid)'>Argives</pl>; for in both cases they have never been satisfied with their continual encroachments.

<p id='4.5.4'><b>4.5.4</b> They point out too that when the <pl id='Q2637650' data-wiki='Phocis_(ancient_region)' title='Phokis region (Central Greece)'>Phocian</pl> leaders had seized the temple at <pl id='Q682558' data-wiki='Delphic_Oracle' title='Delphic Oracle, Pytho (Delphi)'>Delphi</pl>, the kings and every <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Spartan</pl> of repute privately, and the board of ephors and senate publicly, had a share of the god's property. As the most convincing proof that the <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonians</pl> would stick at nothing for the sake of gain, they reproach them with their alliance with <prn id='Q15872635' data-wiki='Apollodorus_of_Cassandreia' title='Apollodorus of Cassandreia (tyrant)'>Apollodorus</prn>, who became tyrant in <pl id='Q999468' data-wiki='Potidaea' title='Poteidaia/Kassandreia (Chalkidike)'>Cassandreia</pl>. </p>

Although the courage of the <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenians</pl> and the length of time for which they fought differ from the facts of the tyranny of <prn id='Q15872635' data-wiki='Apollodorus_of_Cassandreia' title='Apollodorus of Cassandreia (tyrant)'>Apollodorus</prn>, in their disastrous character the sufferings of the people of <pl id='Q999468' data-wiki='Potidaea' title='Poteidaia/Kassandreia (Chalkidike)'>Cassandreia</pl> would not fall far short of the <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenian</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.5.6'><b>4.5.6</b> These then are the reasons for the war which the two sides allege.

The <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenian</pl> kings replied to the ambassadors that after deliberation with the people they would send the findings to <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Sparta</pl> and after their departure they themselves summoned the citizens to a meeting. The views put forward differed widely, <prn id='Q5675384' title='Androkles - Messenian king'>Androcles</prn> urging the surrender of <prn id='Q7226204' data-wiki='Polychares_of_Messenia' title='Polychares of Messenia '>Polychares</prn> as guilty of an impious and abominable crime. <prn id='Q4067043' title='Antiochus - son of the Messenian king Phintas'>Antiochus</prn> among other arguments urged against him that it would be the most piteous thing that <prn id='Q7226204' data-wiki='Polychares_of_Messenia' title='Polychares of Messenia '>Polychares</prn> should suffer before the eyes of <prn id='Q88461412' title='Euaephnus the Spartan - legendary figure responsible for 1st Messenian War'>Euaephnus</prn>, and enumerated in detail all that he would have to undergo. </p>
<p id='4.5.7'><b>4.5.7</b> Finally the supporters of <prn id='Q5675384' title='Androkles - Messenian king'>Androcles</prn> and of <prn id='Q4067043' title='Antiochus - son of the Messenian king Phintas'>Antiochus</prn> were so carried away that they took up arms. But the battle did not last long, for the party of <prn id='Q4067043' title='Antiochus - son of the Messenian king Phintas'>Antiochus</prn>, far outnumbering the other, killed <prn id='Q5675384' title='Androkles - Messenian king'>Androcles</prn> and his principal supporters, <prn id='Q4067043' title='Antiochus - son of the Messenian king Phintas'>Antiochus</prn>, now sole king, sent to <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Sparta</pl> that he was ready to submit the matter to the courts which I have already mentioned. But the <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonians</pl> are said to have made no reply to the bearers of the letter. </p>
<p id='4.5.8'><b>4.5.8</b> Not many months later <prn id='Q4067043' title='Antiochus - son of the Messenian king Phintas'>Antiochus</prn> died and his son <prn id='Q5850304' title='Euphaes - early king of Messenia'>Euphaes</prn> succeeded to the kingdom.

<p id='4.5.9'><b>4.5.9</b> After taking this oath, they attacked <pl id='Q19760768' data-wiki='Ampheia' title='Ampheia (Messenia)'>Ampheia</pl> by night, appointing <prn id='Q1258989' data-wiki='Alcmenes' title='Alcmenes'>Alcamenes</prn> the son of <prn id='Q1258032' data-wiki='Teleclus' title='Teleclus'>Teleclus</prn> leader of the force. <pl id='Q19760768' data-wiki='Ampheia' title='Ampheia (Messenia)'>Ampheia</pl> is a small town in <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenia</pl> near the <pl id='Q11931074' title='Lakonia region (Peloponnese)'>Laconian</pl> border, of no great size, but situated on a high hill and possessing copious springs of water. It seemed generally a suitable base for the whole war. The gates being open and the town not garrisoned, they took it and killed the <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenians</pl> captured there, some still in their beds and others who had taken refuge at the sanctuaries and altars of the gods when they realized what had happened.

<p id='4.5.10'><b>4.5.10</b> This was the first attack which the <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonians</pl> made on the <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenians</pl>, in the second year of the <prn id='Q57337666' title='Ol. 9th Olympiad (744 BCE) - 744-740 BCE'>ninth Olympiad</prn> [743 BCE], when <prn id='Q8043552' data-wiki='Xenocles_of_Messenia' title='Xenocles of Messenia'>Xenodocus</prn> of <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenia</pl> won the short foot-race.

For the <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonians</pl> had longer practice in warfare, but they themselves had a stronger necessity to show themselves brave men, and greater goodwill would be shown by the gods to men defending their country, who were not the authors of injustice. </p>

The cavalry and light-armed engaged above the ravine, but as they were equally matched in numbers and skill, for this reason the fight was indecisive. </p>
<p id='4.7.6'><b>4.7.6</b> While they were involved, <prn id='Q5850304' title='Euphaes - early king of Messenia'>Euphaes</prn> ordered the slaves to fortify with a palisade first the rear of his force and afterwards both flanks, and when the battle had been broken off at nightfall, they fortified his front also on the ravine. So at daybreak the <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonians</pl> realized the forethought of <prn id='Q5850304' title='Euphaes - early king of Messenia'>Euphaes</prn>. They had no means of fighting the <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenians</pl> unless they came out from the stockade, and despaired of forming a siege, for which they were unprepared in all things alike. </p>
<p id='4.7.7'><b>4.7.7</b> They then returned home; but a year later, when the older men reviled them and taunted them both with cowardice and disregard of their oath, they made a second expedition openly against the <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenians</pl>. Both kings were in command, <prn id='Q460405' data-wiki='Theopompus_of_Sparta' title='Theopompus of Sparta'>Theopompus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q2537646' data-wiki='Nicander_of_Sparta' title='Nicander of Sparta'>Nicander</prn> and <prn id='Q1463572' data-wiki='Polydorus_of_Sparta' title='Polydorus of Sparta'>Polydorus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q1258989' data-wiki='Alcmenes' title='Alcmenes'>Alcamenes</prn>, <prn id='Q1258989' data-wiki='Alcmenes' title='Alcmenes'>Alcamenes</prn> being no longer alive. The <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenians</pl> encamped opposite them, and when the <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Spartans</pl> endeavored to join battle, went out to meet them. </p>
<p id='4.7.8'><b>4.7.8</b> The <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonian</pl> commander on the left wing was <prn id='Q1463572' data-wiki='Polydorus_of_Sparta' title='Polydorus of Sparta'>Polydorus</prn>, and <prn id='Q460405' data-wiki='Theopompus_of_Sparta' title='Theopompus of Sparta'>Theopompus</prn> on the right.

<p id='4.7.9'><b>4.7.9</b> As they were about to engage, the kings came forward to encourage their men. The words of encouragement addressed by <prn id='Q460405' data-wiki='Theopompus_of_Sparta' title='Theopompus of Sparta'>Theopompus</prn> to the <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonians</pl> were few, according to their native custom. He reminded them of their oath against the <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenians</pl>, and said how noble was their ambition, to prove themselves to have done a deed more glorious than their fathers, who subdued the neighboring peoples, and to have won a more fortunate land. <prn id='Q5850304' title='Euphaes - early king of Messenia'>Euphaes</prn> spoke at greater length than the <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Spartan</pl>, but no more than he saw the occasion admitted. </p>
<p id='4.7.10'><b>4.7.10</b> He declared that the contest would be not only for land and possessions, but he knew well what would overtake them if defeated. Their wives and children would be carried off as slaves, and death unaccompanied by outrage would be the mildest fate for their grown men their sanctuaries would be despoiled and their ancestral homes burnt. His words were not supposition, the fate of the men captured at <pl id='Q19760768' data-wiki='Ampheia' title='Ampheia (Messenia)'>Ampheia</pl> was evidence that all could see. </p>
<p id='4.7.11'><b>4.7.11</b> Better a noble death than such evils; it was far easier for them, while still undefeated and equally matched in courage, to outdo their adversaries in zeal than to repair their losses when once they had lost heart. </p>
<p id='4.8.1'><b>4.8.1</b> Such were the words of <prn id='Q5850304' title='Euphaes - early king of Messenia'>Euphaes</prn>. When the leaders on either side gave the signal, the <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenians</pl> charged the <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonians</pl> recklessly like men eager for death in their wrath, each one of them eager to be the first to join battle. The <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonians</pl> also advanced to meet them eagerly, but were careful not to break their ranks. </p>
<p id='4.8.2'><b>4.8.2</b> When they were about to come to close quarters, they threatened one another by brandishing their arms and with fierce looks, and fell to recriminations, these calling the <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenians</pl> already their slaves, no freer than the <prn id='Q462484' data-wiki='Helots' title='Helots (Spartan serfs)'>Helots</prn>; the others answering that they were impious in their undertaking, who for the sake of gain attacked their kinsmen and outraged all the ancestral gods of the <prn id='Q203711' data-wiki='Dorians' title='Dorians'>Dorians</prn>, and <prn id='Q122248' data-wiki='Heracles' title='Heracles (s. of Zeus), Hercules'>Heracles</prn> above all. And now with their taunts they come to deeds, mass thrusting against mass, especially on the <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonian</pl> side, and man attacking man. </p>
<p id='4.8.3'><b>4.8.3</b> The <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonians</pl> were far superior both in tactics and training, and also in numbers, for they had with them the neighboring peoples already reduced and serving in their ranks, and the <pl id='Q11917781' data-wiki='Dryopes' title='Dryopes tribe (Euboea)'>Dryopes</pl> of <pl id='Q1154474' data-wiki='Asine' title='Asine (Argolid)'>Asine</pl>, who a generation earlier had been driven out of their own country by the <pl id='Q13533353' title='Argos (Argolid)'>Argives</pl> and had come as suppliants to <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemon</pl>, were forced to serve in the army. Against the <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenian</pl> light-armed they employed <pl id='Q4752820' data-wiki='Ancient_Crete' title='Crete (Greece)'>Cretan</pl> archers as mercenaries. </p>
<p id='4.8.4'><b>4.8.4</b> The <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenians</pl> were inspired alike by desperation and readiness to face death, regarding all their sufferings as necessary rather than terrible to men who honored their country, and exaggerating their achievements and the consequences to the <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonians</pl>. Some of them leapt forth from the ranks, displaying glorious deeds of valor, in others fatally wounded and scarce breathing the frenzy of despair still reigned. </p>
<p id='4.8.5'><b>4.8.5</b> They encouraged one another, the living and unwounded urging the stricken before their last moment came to sell their lives as dearly as they could and accept their fate with joy. And the wounded, when they felt their strength ebbing and breath failing, urged the unwounded to prove themselves no less valorous than they and not to render their death of no avail to their fatherland. </p>
<p id='4.8.6'><b>4.8.6</b> The <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonians</pl> refrained from exhorting one another, and were less inclined than the <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenians</pl> to engage in striking deeds of valor. As they were versed in warfare from boyhood, they employed a deeper formation and hoped that the <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenians</pl> would not endure the contest for so long as they, or sustain the toil of battle or wounds. </p>
<p id='4.8.7'><b>4.8.7</b> These were the differences in both sets of combatants in action and in feeling; but on both sides alike the conquered made no appeals or promises of ransom, perhaps in their enmity despairing of getting quarter, but mainly because they scorned to disgrace their previous achievements. The victorious refrained alike from boasting and from taunts, neither side having yet sure hopes of victory. The most remarkable was the death of those who tried to strip any of the fallen. For if they exposed any part of their bodies, they were struck with javelins or were struck down while intent on their present occupation, or were killed by those whom they were plundering who still lived. </p>
<p id='4.8.8'><b>4.8.8</b> The kings fought in a manner that deserves mention. <prn id='Q460405' data-wiki='Theopompus_of_Sparta' title='Theopompus of Sparta'>Theopompus</prn> rushed wildly forward to slay <prn id='Q5850304' title='Euphaes - early king of Messenia'>Euphaes</prn> himself. <prn id='Q5850304' title='Euphaes - early king of Messenia'>Euphaes</prn>, seeing him advancing, said to <prn id='Q121365916' title='Antander - ancient Messenian war leader against Sparta'>Antander</prn> that the action of <prn id='Q460405' data-wiki='Theopompus_of_Sparta' title='Theopompus of Sparta'>Theopompus</prn> was no different from the attempt of his ancestor <prn id='Q334817' data-wiki='Polynices' title='Polyneices, Polynices (s. of Oedipus)'>Polyneices</prn>; for <prn id='Q334817' data-wiki='Polynices' title='Polyneices, Polynices (s. of Oedipus)'>Polyneices</prn> led an army from <pl id='Q13533353' title='Argos (Argolid)'>Argos</pl> against his fatherland, and slaying his brother with his own hand was slain by him. <prn id='Q460405' data-wiki='Theopompus_of_Sparta' title='Theopompus of Sparta'>Theopompus</prn> was ready to involve the race of the <prn id='Q828084' data-wiki='Heracleidae' title='Heracleidae, Heraklids'>Heracleidae</prn> in pollution as great as that of the house of <prn id='Q463898' data-wiki='Laius' title='Laius (s. of Labdacus)'>Laius</prn> and <prn id='Q130890' data-wiki='Oedipus' title='Oedipus (s. of Laius)'>Oedipus</prn>, but he would not leave the field unscathed. With these words he too advanced. </p>
<p id='4.8.9'><b>4.8.9</b> Thereupon the battle, though the combatants had wearied, everywhere broke out again in full force. Their strength was renewed and recklessness of death heightened on both sides, so that it might have been thought that they were engaging for the first time. Finally <prn id='Q5850304' title='Euphaes - early king of Messenia'>Euphaes</prn> and his men in a frenzy of despair that was near to madness (for picked <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenian</pl> troops formed the whole of the king's bodyguard), overpowering the enemy by their valor, drove back <prn id='Q460405' data-wiki='Theopompus_of_Sparta' title='Theopompus of Sparta'>Theopompus</prn> himself and routed the <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonian</pl> troops opposed to them. </p>
<p id='4.8.10'><b>4.8.10</b> But the other <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenian</pl> wing was in difficulties, for the general <prn id='Q106632482' title='Pytharatus - legendary Messenian war leader'>Pytharatus</prn> had been killed, and the men, without a commander, were fighting in a disorganized and confused manner, though not without heart. <prn id='Q1463572' data-wiki='Polydorus_of_Sparta' title='Polydorus of Sparta'>Polydorus</prn> did not pursue the <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenians</pl> when they gave way, nor <prn id='Q5850304' title='Euphaes - early king of Messenia'>Euphaes</prn>' men the <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonians</pl>. It seemed better to him and his men to support the defeated wing; they did not, however, engage with <prn id='Q1463572' data-wiki='Polydorus_of_Sparta' title='Polydorus of Sparta'>Polydorus</prn>' force, for darkness had already descended on the field; </p>
<p id='4.8.11'><b>4.8.11</b> moreover, the <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonians</pl> were prevented from following the retiring force further not least by their ignorance of the country. Also it was an ancient practice with them not to carry out a pursuit too quickly, as they were more careful about maintaining their formation than about slaying the flying. In the center, where <prn id='Q11921265' title='Euryleon - Spartan warrior of Theban origin'>Euryleon</prn> was commanding the <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonians</pl>, and <prn id='Q88465907' data-wiki='Cleonnis' title='Cleonnis'>Cleonnis</prn> on the <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenian</pl> side, the contest was undecided; the coming of night separated them here also. </p>
<p id='4.8.12'><b>4.8.12</b> This battle was fought principally or entirely by the heavy-armed troops on both sides. The mounted men were few and achieved nothing worth mention; for the <pl id='Q78967' data-wiki='Peloponnese' title='Peloponnese (Hellas)'>Peloponnesians</pl> were not good horsemen then. The <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenian</pl> light-armed and the <pl id='Q4752820' data-wiki='Ancient_Crete' title='Crete (Greece)'>Cretans</pl> on the <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonian</pl> side did not engage at all; for on both sides according to the ancient practice they were posted in reserve to their own infantry. </p>
<p id='4.8.13'><b>4.8.13</b> The following day neither side was minded to begin battle or to be the first to set up a trophy, but as the day advanced they made proposals for taking up the dead; when this was agreed on both sides, they proceeded to bury them. </p>
<p id='4.9.1'><b>4.9.1</b> But after the battle the affairs of the <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenians</pl> began to get serious. They were exhausted by the expenditure of money devoted to the garrisoning of the towns, and their slaves were deserting to the <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonians</pl>. They were visited also by disease, which caused alarm, as resembling plague, although it did not attack all. In these circumstances they resolved to desert all their numerous towns inland and to settle on Mount <pl id='Q602538' data-wiki='Ithome' title='Ithome Mt. (Messenia)'>Ithome</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.9.2'><b>4.9.2</b> A small town existed here, which they say <prn id='Q6691' data-wiki='Homer' title='Homer (poet) '>Homer</prn> mentions in the <prn id='Q1233048' data-wiki='Catalogue_of_Ships' title='Catalogue of Ships'>Catalogue</prn>: “Stepped <pl id='Q602538' data-wiki='Ithome' title='Ithome Mt. (Messenia)'>Ithome</pl>.” To this town they withdrew, extending the old circuit to form a sufficient protection for them all. The place was strong in other respects, for <pl id='Q602538' data-wiki='Ithome' title='Ithome Mt. (Messenia)'>Ithome</pl> falls short of none of the mountains within the <pl id='Q215200' data-wiki='Isthmus_of_Corinth' title='Isthmus (Korinthia)'>Isthmus</pl> in height and at this point was most difficult to climb. </p>
<p id='4.9.3'><b>4.9.3</b> They also resolved to send an envoy to <pl id='Q682558' data-wiki='Delphic_Oracle' title='Delphic Oracle, Pytho (Delphi)'>Delphi</pl>, and despatched <prn id='Q106632523' title='Tisis son of Alcis - Messenian seer'>Tisis</prn> the son of Alcis, a man of the highest reputation, considered to be fully versed in divination. While he was returning from <pl id='Q682558' data-wiki='Delphic_Oracle' title='Delphic Oracle, Pytho (Delphi)'>Delphi</pl> men from the <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonian</pl> garrison at <pl id='Q19760768' data-wiki='Ampheia' title='Ampheia (Messenia)'>Ampheia</pl> laid an ambush for him. Though trapped, he did not submit to be made a prisoner, but stood his ground to resist in spite of the wounds he received, until a voice was heard from an unseen quarter, “Let the bearer of the oracle go free.” </p>
<p id='4.9.4'><b>4.9.4</b> <prn id='Q106632523' title='Tisis son of Alcis - Messenian seer'>Tisis</prn>, reaching <pl id='Q602538' data-wiki='Ithome' title='Ithome Mt.

But if that ye cannot do, offer a maiden from another house, if the father gives her freely for the slaughter.” </p>
<p id='4.9.5'><b>4.9.5</b> When the god declared this, all the maidens of the house of the <prn id='Q27892737' title='Aepytidae - descendants of Aepytus, legendary ruler of Messenia'>Aepytidae</prn> forthwith cast lots, and the lot fell on the daughter of <prn id='Q27892928' data-wiki='Lyciscus_of_Messenia' title='Lyciscus of Messenia'>Lyciscus</prn>. But <prn id='Q40970119' title='Epebolus - ancient Greek seer'>Epebolus</prn> the seer forbade them to offer her, for she was not the daughter of <prn id='Q27892928' data-wiki='Lyciscus_of_Messenia' title='Lyciscus of Messenia'>Lyciscus</prn>, but the woman who was married to <prn id='Q27892928' data-wiki='Lyciscus_of_Messenia' title='Lyciscus of Messenia'>Lyciscus</prn> being unable to bear a child had palmed off the girl as hers. While <prn id='Q40970119' title='Epebolus - ancient Greek seer'>Epebolus</prn> was making this declaration, <prn id='Q27892928' data-wiki='Lyciscus_of_Messenia' title='Lyciscus of Messenia'>Lyciscus</prn> took the girl away and deserted to <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Sparta</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.9.6'><b>4.9.6</b> The <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenians</pl> were in despair when they saw that <prn id='Q27892928' data-wiki='Lyciscus_of_Messenia' title='Lyciscus of Messenia'>Lyciscus</prn> had fled; thereupon <prn id='Q2709649' data-wiki='Aristodemus_of_Messenia' title='Aristodemus'>Aristodemus</prn>, a son of the house of the <prn id='Q27892737' title='Aepytidae - descendants of Aepytus, legendary ruler of Messenia'>Aepytidae</prn>, of higher standing than <prn id='Q27892928' data-wiki='Lyciscus_of_Messenia' title='Lyciscus of Messenia'>Lyciscus</prn> both in reputation and in war, freely offered his daughter for the sacrifice. But human affairs and human purpose above all are obscured by fate, just as the mud of a river hides a pebble; for when <prn id='Q2709649' data-wiki='Aristodemus_of_Messenia' title='Aristodemus'>Aristodemus</prn> was striving his utmost to save <pl id='Q1022117' data-wiki='Messene' title='Messene (Messenia)'>Messene</pl>, fate set this obstacle in his path. </p>
<p id='4.9.7'><b>4.9.7</b> A <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenian</pl>, whose name is not recorded, was in love with the daughter of <prn id='Q2709649' data-wiki='Aristodemus_of_Messenia' title='Aristodemus'>Aristodemus</prn>, and was already about to make her his wife.

The expedition was openly proclaimed among the <pl id='Q12898802' data-wiki='Arcadia_(region)' title='Arkadia region (Arkadia)'>Arcadians</pl>, but they did not arrive either. For the <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenians</pl> were induced by the credit placed in the oracle to face the risk without allies. </p>
<p id='4.10.2'><b>4.10.2</b> This engagement did not differ in most points from the first, as on this occasion too daylight failed the combatants, but they record that on neither side was a wing or division broken, as they did not maintain the formation in which they were originally posted, champions on either side meeting in the middle, and there supporting the whole combat. </p>
<p id='4.10.3'><b>4.10.3</b> <prn id='Q5850304' title='Euphaes - early king of Messenia'>Euphaes</prn>, who showed more eagerness than a king should and recklessly attacked <prn id='Q460405' data-wiki='Theopompus_of_Sparta' title='Theopompus of Sparta'>Theopompus</prn>' bodyguard, received a number of mortal wounds. When he swooned and fell, the <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonians</pl> did their utmost to drag him into their own ranks, as he still breathed.

<p id='4.10.4'><b>4.10.4</b> So the fall of <prn id='Q5850304' title='Euphaes - early king of Messenia'>Euphaes</prn> prolonged the battle and called forth further deeds of daring on both sides.

<p id='4.11.1'><b>4.11.1</b> In the fifth year of the reign of <prn id='Q2709649' data-wiki='Aristodemus_of_Messenia' title='Aristodemus'>Aristodemus</prn>, being exhausted by the length of the war and by their expenditure, after due notice that a battle would be fought, both sides were joined by their allies, the <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonians</pl> by the <pl id='Q1363688' data-wiki='Ancient_Corinth' title='Corinth/Korinthos (Korinthia)'>Corinthians</pl> alone of the <pl id='Q78967' data-wiki='Peloponnese' title='Peloponnese (Hellas)'>Peloponnesians</pl>, the <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenians</pl> by the full muster of' the <pl id='Q12898802' data-wiki='Arcadia_(region)' title='Arkadia region (Arkadia)'>Arcadians</pl> and by picked troops from <pl id='Q13533353' title='Argos (Argolid)'>Argos</pl> and <pl id='Q368628' data-wiki='Sicyon' title='Sikyon (Korinthia)'>Sicyon</pl>. The <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonians</pl> entrusted their center to the <pl id='Q1363688' data-wiki='Ancient_Corinth' title='Corinth/Korinthos (Korinthia)'>Corinthians</pl>, <prn id='Q462484' data-wiki='Helots' title='Helots (Spartan serfs)'>Helots</prn> and all the neighboring peoples who were serving with them; they themselves and the kings were posted on the wings in a deeper and closer formation than ever before. </p>
<p id='4.11.2'><b>4.11.2</b> The dispositions of <prn id='Q2709649' data-wiki='Aristodemus_of_Messenia' title='Aristodemus'>Aristodemus</prn> and his men were as follows: he selected the most serviceable of the arms for all the <pl id='Q12898802' data-wiki='Arcadia_(region)' title='Arkadia region (Arkadia)'>Arcadians</pl> and <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenians</pl> who were physically strong and stout hearted but did not possess powerful weapons, and as the matter was urgent, posted them with the <pl id='Q13533353' title='Argos (Argolid)'>Argives</pl> and <pl id='Q368628' data-wiki='Sicyon' title='Sikyon (Korinthia)'>Sicyonians</pl>, extending the line that they might not be surrounded by the enemy. He also took care that they should be drawn up with Mount <pl id='Q602538' data-wiki='Ithome' title='Ithome Mt. (Messenia)'>Ithome</pl> in their rear. Placing <prn id='Q88465907' data-wiki='Cleonnis' title='Cleonnis'>Cleonnis</prn> in command of these troops, </p>
<p id='4.11.3'><b>4.11.3</b> he himself and <prn id='Q1158563' data-wiki='Damis' title='Damis'>Damis</prn> remained in reserve with the light troops consisting of a few slingers or archers, the bulk of the force being physically suited to rapid assaults and retirements and lightly armed. Not all of them possessed a breastplate or shield, but those who lacked them were protected with the skins of <prn id='Q2934' data-wiki='Goat' title='Goats'>goats</prn> and <prn id='Q7368' data-wiki='Sheep' title='Sheep'>sheep</prn>, some of them, particularly the <pl id='Q12898802' data-wiki='Arcadia_(region)' title='Arkadia region (Arkadia)'>Arcadian</pl> mountaineers, having the hides of wild beasts, <prn id='Q18498' data-wiki='Wolf' title='Wolf, Wolves'>wolves</prn> and bears. </p>
<p id='4.11.4'><b>4.11.4</b> Each carried several javelins, and some of them spears. While these were in ambush in a part of <pl id='Q602538' data-wiki='Ithome' title='Ithome Mt. (Messenia)'>Ithome</pl> where they were least likely to be visible, the heavy-armed troops of the <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenians</pl> and their allies withstood the first assault of the <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonians</pl>, and continued after this to show courage in every way. They were inferior in numbers to the enemy, but were picked men fighting against levies, not selected troops like themselves, and so, by their bravery and training were more able to maintain a lengthy resistance. </p>
<p id='4.11.5'><b>4.11.5</b> Then the mobile <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenian</pl> force, when the signal was given to them, charged the <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonians</pl> and enveloping them threw javelins on their flanks. All who were of higher courage ran in and struck at close quarters. The <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonians</pl>, faced simultaneously with a second and unforeseen danger, were not demoralized, but turning on the light troops, tried to defend themselves. But, as the enemy with their light equipment drew off without difficulty, the <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonians</pl> were filled with perplexity and, as a consequence, with anger. </p>
<p id='4.11.6'><b>4.11.6</b> Men are apt to be most annoyed by what they regard as beneath them. So then the <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Spartans</pl> who had already been wounded and all who after the fall of their comrades were the first to meet the attack of the light troops, ran out to meet them when they saw the light troops advancing and hotly extended the pursuit as they retired. The <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenian</pl> light troops maintained their original tactics, striking and shooting at them when they stood still, and outstripping them in flight when they pursued, attacking again as they tried to retire. </p>
<p id='4.11.7'><b>4.11.7</b> They did this in separate parties and at different points of the enemy's line. The <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenian</pl> heavy-armed and their allies meantime pressed more boldly on the troops facing them. Finally the <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonians</pl>, worn out by the length of the battle and their wounds, and demoralized contrary to their custom by the light troops, broke their ranks. When they had been routed, the light troops inflicted greater damage on them. </p>
<p id='4.11.8'><b>4.11.8</b> It was impossible to reckon the <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonian</pl> losses in the battle, but I for my part am convinced that they were heavy. The rest made their retreat homewards without molestation, but for the <pl id='Q1363688' data-wiki='Ancient_Corinth' title='Corinth/Korinthos (Korinthia)'>Corinthians</pl> it was likely to be difficult, for whether they tried to retire through the <pl id='Q12649101' title='Argolid region (Peloponnese)'>Argolid</pl> or by <pl id='Q368628' data-wiki='Sicyon' title='Sikyon (Korinthia)'>Sicyon</pl>, in either case it was through enemy country. </p>
<p id='4.12.1'><b>4.12.1</b> The <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonians</pl> were distressed by the reverse that had befallen them. Their losses in the battle were great and included important men, and they were inclined to despair of all hope in the war. For this reason they sent envoys to <pl id='Q682558' data-wiki='Delphic_Oracle' title='Delphic Oracle, Pytho (Delphi)'>Delphi</pl>, who received the following reply from the <prn id='Q220344' data-wiki='Pythia' title='Pythia, oracular priestess at Delphi'>Pythia</prn>: “<prn id='Q37340' data-wiki='Apollo' title='Apollo (s. of Zeus) (cf Phoebus)'>Phoebus</prn> bids thee pursue not only the task of war with the hand, but by guile a people holds the <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenian</pl> land, and by the same arts as they first employed shall the people fall.” </p>
<p id='4.12.2'><b>4.12.2</b> At this the kings and ephors were eager to invent stratagems, but failed.

On their arrival <prn id='Q2709649' data-wiki='Aristodemus_of_Messenia' title='Aristodemus'>Aristodemus</prn> at once sent them away, saying that the crimes of the <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonians</pl> were new, but their tricks old. </p>
<p id='4.12.3'><b>4.12.3</b> Failing in their attempt, the <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonians</pl> next attempted to break up the <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenian</pl> alliance. But when repulsed by the <pl id='Q12898802' data-wiki='Arcadia_(region)' title='Arkadia region (Arkadia)'>Arcadians</pl>, to whom their ambassadors came first, they put off going to <pl id='Q13533353' title='Argos (Argolid)'>Argos</pl>. <prn id='Q2709649' data-wiki='Aristodemus_of_Messenia' title='Aristodemus'>Aristodemus</prn>, hearing of the <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonian</pl> intrigues, also sent men to enquire of the god. And the <prn id='Q220344' data-wiki='Pythia' title='Pythia, oracular priestess at Delphi'>Pythia</prn> replied to them: </p>
<p id='4.12.4'><b>4.12.4</b> “The god gives thee glory in war, but beware lest by guile the hated company of <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Sparta</pl> scale the well-built walls, for mightier is their <prn id='Q40901' data-wiki='Ares' title='Ares (s. of Zeus), Mars'>Ares</prn>.

<p id='4.12.5'><b>4.12.5</b> Other things befell the <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenians</pl> at that time: while <prn id='Q27892928' data-wiki='Lyciscus_of_Messenia' title='Lyciscus of Messenia'>Lyciscus</prn> was living abroad in <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Sparta</pl>, death overtook the daughter whom he carried with him on his flight from <pl id='Q1022117' data-wiki='Messene' title='Messene (Messenia)'>Messene</pl>. As he often visited her tomb, <pl id='Q12898802' data-wiki='Arcadia_(region)' title='Arkadia region (Arkadia)'>Arcadian</pl> horsemen lay in wait and captured him. When carried to <pl id='Q602538' data-wiki='Ithome' title='Ithome Mt.

<p id='4.12.6'><b>4.12.6</b> His defence did not win credence until the woman who was then holding the priesthood of <prn id='Q38012' data-wiki='Hera' title='Hera (d. of Cronus), Juno'>Hera</prn> came into the theater. She confessed that she was the mother of the girl and had given her to <prn id='Q27892928' data-wiki='Lyciscus_of_Messenia' title='Lyciscus of Messenia'>Lyciscus</prn>' wife to pass off as her own. “And now,” she said, “revealing the secret, I have come to lay down my office.” She said this because it was an established custom in <pl id='Q1022117' data-wiki='Messene' title='Messene (Messenia)'>Messene</pl> that, if a child of a man or woman holding a priesthood died before its parent, the office should pass to another. Accepting the truth of her statement, they chose another woman to take her place as priestess of the goddess, and said that <prn id='Q27892928' data-wiki='Lyciscus_of_Messenia' title='Lyciscus of Messenia'>Lyciscus</prn>' deed was pardonable. </p>
<p id='4.12.7'><b>4.12.7</b> After this, as the twentieth year of the war was approaching, they resolved to send again to <pl id='Q682558' data-wiki='Delphic_Oracle' title='Delphic Oracle, Pytho (Delphi)'>Delphi</pl> to ask concerning victory. The <prn id='Q220344' data-wiki='Pythia' title='Pythia, oracular priestess at Delphi'>Pythia</prn> made answer to their question: “To those who first around the altar set up tripods ten times ten to <prn id='Q34201' data-wiki='Zeus' title='Zeus (s. of Cronus), Jupiter'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q107247012' title='Ithomatas - epithet of Zeus at ancient Messene'>Ithomatas</prn>, heaven grants glory in war and the <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenian</pl> land.

<p id='4.12.8'><b>4.12.8</b> Hearing this they thought that the oracle was in their favour and granted them victory; for as they themselves possessed the sanctuary of <prn id='Q34201' data-wiki='Zeus' title='Zeus (s. of Cronus), Jupiter'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q107247012' title='Ithomatas - epithet of Zeus at ancient Messene'>Ithomatas</prn> within the walls, the <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonians</pl> could not forestall them in making the dedication.

Thenceforward he marked the time when her husband went away to mount guard, garrison duty on the acropolis being undertaken by the <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenians</pl> in turn. For it was at this point that they were most afraid of the enemy making their way into the town. Whenever he went away, then the herdsman used to visit the lady. </p>
<p id='4.20.7'><b>4.20.7</b> Now once when it happened that the turn for duty fell to him and others in the night, it chanced that there was heavy rain, and the <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenians</pl> deserted their post. For they were overcome by the density of the rain that streamed from heaven, as there were no battlements or towers erected on the wall owing to the hurried nature of its building; moreover they did not expect the <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonians</pl> even to stir on a moonless night that was so stormy. </p>

This was the main reason that the acropolis was deserted. </p>
<p id='4.20.9'><b>4.20.9</b> All of them left their posts and with them the husband of the woman seduced by the herdsman. She was entertaining the herdsman at the time but heard her husband coming and at once hid the man away as quickly as possible. When the husband entered, she treated him with greater affection than ever before and asked him what was the reason of his return. But knowing that she was unfaithful or that the herdsman was in the house, he told her the truth, that owing to the violence of the rain he and all the rest had deserted their post. </p>
<p id='4.20.10'><b>4.20.10</b> The herdsman listened to him speaking, and learning the exact position, again deserted from the <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenians</pl> to the <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonians</pl>.

<p id='4.21.1'><b>4.21.1</b> His story seemed to be reliable, and he led the way for <prn id='Q122965870' title='Emperamus - Spartan officer and landowner in Second Messenian War'>Emperamus</prn> and the <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Spartans</pl>.

Various indications of the trouble that was upon them were given to the <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenians</pl>, especially by the <prn id='Q144' data-wiki='Dog' title='Dogs'>dogs</prn> barking, not in their usual fashion, but uttering more loud and continuous howls. Realizing that the supreme and most desperate crisis had come upon them, they did not wait to collect all their arms but snatched whatever lay ready to the hand of each, to defend the fatherland that alone was left to them of all <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenia</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.21.2'><b>4.21.2</b> The first to realize that the enemy were within and to go against them were <prn id='Q20851109' title='Gorgus of Messenia - son of Aristomenes and leader of the Messenians'>Gorgus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q1258025' data-wiki='Aristomenes' title='Aristomenes'>Aristomenes</prn>, <prn id='Q1258025' data-wiki='Aristomenes' title='Aristomenes'>Aristomenes</prn> himself, <prn id='Q31790263' title='Theoclus - Messenian seer from Elis'>Theoclus</prn> the seer and <prn id='Q31789658' title='Manticlus - Messenian seer'>Manticlus</prn> his son, and with them Euergetidas a man of high repute in <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenia</pl> who had attained to greater honor through his wife for he was wedded to <prn id='Q106782065' title='Hagnagora - sister of Aristomenes of Messenia'>Hagnagora</prn>, the sister of <prn id='Q1258025' data-wiki='Aristomenes' title='Aristomenes'>Aristomenes</prn>.

<p id='4.21.3'><b>4.21.3</b> But <prn id='Q1258025' data-wiki='Aristomenes' title='Aristomenes'>Aristomenes</prn> and the seer knew that there was no putting off destruction for the <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenians</pl>, for they knew the riddle of the oracle which the <prn id='Q220344' data-wiki='Pythia' title='Pythia, oracular priestess at Delphi'>Pythia</prn> had uttered concerning the <prn id='Q2934' data-wiki='Goat' title='Goats'>goat</prn>. Nevertheless they would not declare it, and kept it secret from the rest. As they hastened through the city, visiting all, they exhorted those whom they encountered, when they saw that they were <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenians</pl>, to be brave men, and summoned from the houses those who still remained. </p>
<p id='4.21.4'><b>4.21.4</b> During the night nothing worthy of mention was done on either side; for their ignorance of the ground and the daring of <prn id='Q1258025' data-wiki='Aristomenes' title='Aristomenes'>Aristomenes</prn> gave pause to the <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonians</pl>, while the <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenians</pl> had not previously received a watchword from their generals, and the rain would put out torches or any other light that they kindled. </p>
<p id='4.21.5'><b>4.21.5</b> When it was day and they could see one another <prn id='Q1258025' data-wiki='Aristomenes' title='Aristomenes'>Aristomenes</prn> and <prn id='Q31790263' title='Theoclus - Messenian seer from Elis'>Theoclus</prn> tried to rouse the fury of despair in the <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenians</pl>, setting forth all that suited the occasion and reminding them of the valor of the men of <pl id='Q1379299' data-wiki='Smyrna' title='Old Smyrna (Aiolis)'>Smyrna</pl>, how, though an <pl id='Q620874' data-wiki='Ionia' title='Ionia region (Asia Minor)'>Ionian</pl> people, by their valor and courage they had driven out <prn id='Q312537' data-wiki='Gyges_of_Lydia' title='Gyges of Lydia'>Gyges</prn> the son of <prn id='Q1171928' title='Dascylus - legendary figure, father of Gyges'>Dascylus</prn> and the <pl id='Q620765' data-wiki='Lydia' title='Lydia region (Asia Minor)'>Lydians</pl>, when they were in occupation of their town. </p>

Women too were eager to fling tiles and what they could upon the enemy, yet the violence of the rain prevented them from doing this and from mounting to the house-tops. But they dared to take arms, and they too further inflamed the ardor of the men, when they saw their women preferring to perish with their fatherland rather than be taken as slaves to <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemon</pl>, so that they might yet have been able to escape their fate. </p>
<p id='4.21.7'><b>4.21.7</b> But the god caused the rain to descend more densely, with loud claps of thunder, and dazzled their eyes with lightning flashing in their faces. All this put courage in the <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonians</pl>, who said that heaven itself was-helping them and as the lightning was on their right, <prn id='Q106632818' title='Hecas - Sparta seer during second Messenian War'>Hecas</prn> the seer declared the sign of good omen. </p>
<p id='4.21.8'><b>4.21.8</b> It was he who devised the following plan. The <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonians</pl> far outnumbered the <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenians</pl>, but as the battle was not being fought on open ground with troops in line, but they were fighting over different quarters of the town, the rearmost of each detachment were rendered useless. <prn id='Q106632818' title='Hecas - Sparta seer during second Messenian War'>Hecas</prn> ordered these to retire to the camp, take food and sleep, and return before evening to relieve their own men who were to remain on duty. </p>
<p id='4.21.9'><b>4.21.9</b> The <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonians</pl>, by resting and fighting by turns, held out the longer, but the <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenians</pl> were faced with difficulties on all sides. They fought continuously day and night until the third day with none to relieve them. When the next day dawned, worn out by lack of sleep and by the rain and cold from heaven, they were assailed by hunger and thirst. The women especially, unaccustomed to war, were exhausted by the continuous suffering. </p>
<p id='4.21.10'><b>4.21.10</b> So the seer <prn id='Q31790263' title='Theoclus - Messenian seer from Elis'>Theoclus</prn> came to <prn id='Q1258025' data-wiki='Aristomenes' title='Aristomenes'>Aristomenes</prn>' side and said: “Why vainly maintain this toil?

On me the gods have laid one doom with my country, but do thou save the <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenians</pl> with what power thou hast and save thyself.” When he had spoken to <prn id='Q1258025' data-wiki='Aristomenes' title='Aristomenes'>Aristomenes</prn> he rushed upon the enemy, and these were the words that he was constrained to fling at the <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonians</pl>. “Yet not for all time shall you enjoy the fruits of <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenia</pl> with impunity.” </p>
<p id='4.21.11'><b>4.21.11</b> Then falling upon the men who faced him he killed them and himself was wounded, and having sated his passion with the slaughter of his foes, he breathed his last.

<p id='4.21.12'><b>4.21.12</b> He appointed <prn id='Q20851109' title='Gorgus of Messenia - son of Aristomenes and leader of the Messenians'>Gorgus</prn> and <prn id='Q31789658' title='Manticlus - Messenian seer'>Manticlus</prn> to command the rear, he himself ran to the head of the company and by the gestures of his head and movement of his spear signified that he asked a passage and had resolved to depart. Emperamus and the <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Spartans</pl> present were pleased to let the <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenians</pl> pass, without further inflaming men who had reached the bounds of frenzy and despair. Moreover <prn id='Q106632818' title='Hecas - Sparta seer during second Messenian War'>Hecas</prn> the seer ordered them to act thus. </p>
<p id='4.22.1'><b>4.22.1</b> As soon as the <pl id='Q12898802' data-wiki='Arcadia_(region)' title='Arkadia region (Arkadia)'>Arcadians</pl> heard of the Capture of <pl id='Q16575287' data-wiki='Eira_(Messenia)' title='Eira (Messenia)'>Eira</pl>, they at once ordered <prn id='Q666652' data-wiki='Aristocrates_of_Orchomenus' title='Aristocrates II of Arcadia, son of Hicetas'>Aristocrates</prn> to lead them to the rescue of the <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenians</pl> or to death with them. But he, being in receipt of bribes from <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemon</pl>, refused to lead them, and said that he knew that no <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenian</pl> survived for them to help. </p>
<p id='4.22.2'><b>4.22.2</b> When they obtained more certain news, that they survived and had been forced to desert <pl id='Q16575287' data-wiki='Eira_(Messenia)' title='Eira (Messenia)'>Eira</pl>, they themselves proposed to receive them at <pl id='Q1878690' data-wiki='Mount_Lykaion' title='Lykaion Mt.

<p id='4.22.4'><b>4.22.4</b> When they said that they were ready, he revealed the whole plan, that he proposed at all costs to lead them against <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Sparta</pl> during the following evening.

<p id='4.25.1'><b>4.25.1</b> When they occupied <pl id='Q56398924' title='Naupactus (Aitolia)'>Naupactus</pl> it was not enough for them to have received a city and country at the hands of the <pl id='Q844930' data-wiki='Classical_Athens' title='Athens (Attica)'>Athenians</pl>, but they were filled with a strong desire to show that they had won something notable with their own hands. Knowing that the <pl id='Q416070' data-wiki='Acarnania' title='Akarnania region (Akarnania)'>Acarnanians</pl> of <pl id='Q2016870' data-wiki='Oeniadae' title='Oiniadai (Aitolia)'>Oeniadae</pl> possessed a good land and were continually at war with the <pl id='Q844930' data-wiki='Classical_Athens' title='Athens (Attica)'>Athenians</pl>, they marched against them. They had no numerical advantage, but defeating them by their superior courage, they shut them up in the fortress and besieged them. </p>
<p id='4.25.2'><b>4.25.2</b> They neglected no human invention in the matter of siege-craft, tried to carry the town by raising scaling-ladders, mined the walls, and by bringing up such engines as could be made ready at short notice proceeded with the destruction of the fortifications. The inhabitants, fearing that if the city were taken they would be put to death and their wives and children enslaved, elected to withdraw on terms. </p>
<p id='4.25.3'><b>4.25.3</b> The <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenians</pl> held the town and occupied the country for about a year. In the following year the <pl id='Q416070' data-wiki='Acarnania' title='Akarnania region (Akarnania)'>Acarnanians</pl> collected a force from all their towns and discussed an attack on <pl id='Q56398924' title='Naupactus (Aitolia)'>Naupactus</pl>. They rejected this, as they saw that their line of march would be through the <pl id='Q26857' data-wiki='Aetolia' title='Aitolia region (Aitolia)'>Aetolians</pl>, who were always their enemies; moreover they suspected that the men of <pl id='Q56398924' title='Naupactus (Aitolia)'>Naupactus</pl> possessed a fleet, which was the fact; and while they commanded the sea, it was impossible to achieve anything of importance with a land force. </p>
<p id='4.25.4'><b>4.25.4</b> So they changed their plans and at once turned on the <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenians</pl> in <pl id='Q2016870' data-wiki='Oeniadae' title='Oiniadai (Aitolia)'>Oeniadae</pl> and prepared to besiege them, for they never supposed that men so few in number would show such desperate courage as to fight against the full levy of the <pl id='Q416070' data-wiki='Acarnania' title='Akarnania region (Akarnania)'>Acarnanians</pl>. The <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenians</pl> had previously prepared food and all else that was requisite, expecting to stand a long siege. </p>
<p id='4.25.5'><b>4.25.5</b> But they were determined before the siege was formed to fight a battle in the open, and being <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenians</pl>, who had not been surpassed in valor even by <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonians</pl>, but in fortune only, were determined not to be dismayed at the horde which had come from <pl id='Q416070' data-wiki='Acarnania' title='Akarnania region (Akarnania)'>Acarnania</pl>. They recalled the achievement of the <pl id='Q844930' data-wiki='Classical_Athens' title='Athens (Attica)'>Athenians</pl> at <pl id='Q31900' data-wiki='Battle_of_Marathon' title='Marathon battlefield (Attica)'>Marathon</pl>, how thirty myriad <pl id='Q3746183' data-wiki='Persis' title='Persia (Asia)'>Persians</pl> had been destroyed by men not numbering ten thousand. </p>
<p id='4.25.6'><b>4.25.6</b> So they joined battle with the <pl id='Q416070' data-wiki='Acarnania' title='Akarnania region (Akarnania)'>Acarnanians</pl>, and the course of the battle is said to have been thus. The enemy, being far superior in numbers, had no difficulty in surrounding the <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenians</pl>, except where prevented by the gates in the <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenian</pl> rear and by the zealous help of their men posted on the wall. Here they could not be surrounded, but the <pl id='Q416070' data-wiki='Acarnania' title='Akarnania region (Akarnania)'>Acarnanians</pl> enveloped both their flanks and shot volleys at them from all sides. </p>

For wherever the <pl id='Q416070' data-wiki='Acarnania' title='Akarnania region (Akarnania)'>Acarnanians</pl> saw a part of their own line being broken by the <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenians</pl> they went to the support of their harassed troops at this point and checked the <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenians</pl>, overwhelming them by numbers. </p>
<p id='4.25.8'><b>4.25.8</b> The <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenians</pl>, beaten back and again attempting to pierce the massed troops of the <pl id='Q416070' data-wiki='Acarnania' title='Akarnania region (Akarnania)'>Acarnanians</pl> at another point, would meet with the same result. Wherever they attacked, they threw the enemy into confusion and drove them a short distance, but as the <pl id='Q416070' data-wiki='Acarnania' title='Akarnania region (Akarnania)'>Acarnanians</pl> again streamed eagerly to this point, they were driven back against their will. The battle was evenly contested until evening, but when at nightfall the <pl id='Q416070' data-wiki='Acarnania' title='Akarnania region (Akarnania)'>Acarnanians</pl> received reinforcements from their cities, the blockade of the <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenians</pl> was formed. </p>
<p id='4.25.9'><b>4.25.9</b> They had no fear of the wall being taken by assault, either by the <pl id='Q416070' data-wiki='Acarnania' title='Akarnania region (Akarnania)'>Acarnanians</pl> scaling it or by themselves being forced to abandon their posts. But in the eighth month all their provisions alike had been consumed. </p>
<p id='4.25.10'><b>4.25.10</b> They shouted to the <pl id='Q416070' data-wiki='Acarnania' title='Akarnania region (Akarnania)'>Acarnanians</pl> from the wall in mockery that their supplies would not fail them until the tenth year of the siege, but they themselves sallied out of <pl id='Q2016870' data-wiki='Oeniadae' title='Oiniadai (Aitolia)'>Oeniadae</pl> at the time of the first sleep. Their escape became known to the <pl id='Q416070' data-wiki='Acarnania' title='Akarnania region (Akarnania)'>Acarnanians</pl> and they were compelled to fight, losing some three hundred and killing still more of the enemy. But the greater part of them got through the <pl id='Q416070' data-wiki='Acarnania' title='Akarnania region (Akarnania)'>Acarnanians</pl>, and reaching the territory of the <pl id='Q26857' data-wiki='Aetolia' title='Aitolia region (Aitolia)'>Aetolians</pl>, who were their friends, arrived safely at <pl id='Q56398924' title='Naupactus (Aitolia)'>Naupactus</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.26.1'><b>4.26.1</b> Afterwards, as at all times, they were stirred by their hatred against the <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonians</pl>, and provided the most striking example of their hostility towards them in the war which took place between the <pl id='Q78967' data-wiki='Peloponnese' title='Peloponnese (Hellas)'>Peloponnesians</pl> and the <pl id='Q844930' data-wiki='Classical_Athens' title='Athens (Attica)'>Athenians</pl>.

So the majority of the <pl id='Q1247159' data-wiki='Messenia_(ancient_region)' title='Messenia region (Messenia)'>Messenians</pl> went to them, their leader being <prn id='Q106634788' title='Comon the Messenian - leader of the Messenian exile to Libya'>Comon</prn>, who had commanded them in <pl id='Q1303524' data-wiki='Sphacteria' title='Sphakteria (Messenia)'>Sphacteria</pl>. </p>

Nay, the god himself according to legend bore witness to the artistic skill of <prn id='Q177302' data-wiki='Phidias' title='Phidias (sculptor)'>Pheidias</prn>. For when the image was quite finished <prn id='Q177302' data-wiki='Phidias' title='Phidias (sculptor)'>Pheidias</prn> prayed the god to show by a sign whether the work was to his liking. Immediately, runs the legend, a thunderbolt fell on that part of the floor where down to the present day the bronze jar stood to cover the place. </p>

For olive oil is beneficial to the image at <pl id='Q38888' data-wiki='Olympia,_Greece' title='Olympian Zeus sanctuary (Eleia)'>Olympia</pl>, and it is olive oil that keeps the ivory from being harmed by the marshiness of the <pl id='Q2400346' data-wiki='Altis' title='Altis sacred grove (Olympia)'>Altis</pl>.

<p id='5.12.1'><b>5.12.1</b> Those who think that the projections from the mouth of an elephant are not horns but teeth of the animal should consider both the elk, a beast of the <pl id='Q35966' data-wiki='Celts' title='Keltike (Europe)'>Celtic</pl> land, and also the <pl id='Q410453' data-wiki='Aethiopia' title='Aethiopia (Africa)'>Aethiopian</pl> <prn id='Q693690' data-wiki='Bull' title='Bulls'>bull</prn>. Male elks have horns on their brows, but the female does not grow them at all. Ethiopian <prn id='Q693690' data-wiki='Bull' title='Bulls'>bulls</prn> grow their horns on their noses. Who therefore would be greatly surprised at horns growing out of an animal's mouth? </p>
<p id='5.12.2'><b>5.12.2</b> They may also correct their error from the following considerations. Horns drop off animals each year and grow again; the deer and the antelope undergo this experience, and so likewise does the elephant. But a tooth will never be found to grow again, at least after the animal is full-grown. So if the projections through the mouth were teeth and not horns, how could they grow up again? Again, a tooth refuses to yield to fire; but fire turns the horns of <prn id='Q473194' data-wiki='Ox' title='Oxen'>oxen</prn> and elephants from round to flat, and also into other shapes. However, the hippopotamus and the <prn id='Q58697' data-wiki='Wild_boar' title='Wild boar'>boar</prn> have tusks growing out of the lower jaw, but we do not see horns growing out of jaws. </p>
<p id='5.12.3'><b>5.12.3</b> So be assured that an elephant's horns descend through the temples from above, and so bend outwards. My statement is not hearsay; I once saw an elephant's skull in the <pl id='Q133868539' title='Temple of Diana Tifatina (Campania)'>sanctuary</pl> of <prn id='Q39503' data-wiki='Artemis' title='Artemis (d. of Zeus), Diana'>Artemis</prn> in <pl id='411146RCam' title'Campania region (Italy)(missing Wiki)'>Campania</pl>.

So the elephant differs from all other animals in the way its horns grow, just as its size and shape are peculiar to itself. And the Greeks in my opinion showed an unsurpassed zeal and generosity in honoring the gods, in that they imported ivory from <pl id='Q17055962' data-wiki='India_(Herodotus)' title='India (Asia)'>India</pl> and <pl id='Q410453' data-wiki='Aethiopia' title='Aethiopia (Africa)'>Aethiopia</pl> to make images. </p>

When the <pl id='Q6536845' data-wiki='Ancient_Elis' title='Eleia or Elis region (Eleia)'>Eleans</pl> were repairing it, the corpse of a foot-soldier with wounds was discovered between the roof supporting the tiles and the ornamented ceiling.

At any rate this soldier seemed to us to have crept under here after growing faint with his wounds, and so died. Lying in a completely sheltered spot the corpse would suffer harm neither from the heat of summer nor from the frost of winter. <prn id='Q106796783' title='Aristarchus (ancient Olympia) - Exegete - ancient explainer of the sights at the Zeus sanctuary at Olympia'>Aristarchus</prn> said further that they carried the corpse outside the <pl id='Q2400346' data-wiki='Altis' title='Altis sacred grove (Olympia)'>Altis</pl> and buried him in the earth along with his armour. </p>
<p id='5.20.6'><b>5.20.6</b> What the <pl id='Q6536845' data-wiki='Ancient_Elis' title='Eleia or Elis region (Eleia)'>Eleans</pl> call the pillar of <prn id='Q847890' data-wiki='Oenomaus' title='Oenomaus (s. of Ares)'>Oenomaus</prn> is in the direction of the sanctuary of <prn id='Q34201' data-wiki='Zeus' title='Zeus (s. of Cronus), Jupiter'>Zeus</prn> as you go from the great altar. On the left are four pillars with a roof on them, the whole constructed to protect a wooden pillar which has decayed through age, being for the most part held together by bands. This pillar, so runs the tale, stood in the house of <prn id='Q847890' data-wiki='Oenomaus' title='Oenomaus (s. of Ares)'>Oenomaus</prn>.

<p id='5.20.7'><b>5.20.7</b> A bronze tablet in front of it has the following elegiac inscription: <br>“Stranger, I am a remnant of a famous house, <br>I, who once was a pillar in the house of <prn id='Q847890' data-wiki='Oenomaus' title='Oenomaus (s. of Ares)'>Oenomaus</prn>; <br>Now by <prn id='Q44204' data-wiki='Cronus' title='Cronus (s. of Uranus), Saturn'>Cronus</prn>' son I lie with these bands upon me, <br>A precious thing, and the baleful flame of fire consumed me not.” <br>In my time another incident took place, which I will relate. </p>
<p id='5.20.8'><b>5.20.8</b> A Roman senator won an <pl id='Q38888' data-wiki='Olympia,_Greece' title='Olympian Zeus sanctuary (Eleia)'>Olympic</pl> victory. Wishing to leave behind, as a memorial of his victory, a bronze statue with an inscription, he proceeded to dig, so as to make a foundation. When his excavation came very close to the pillar of <prn id='Q847890' data-wiki='Oenomaus' title='Oenomaus (s. of Ares)'>Oenomaus</prn>, the diggers found there fragments of armour, bridles and curbs. </p>
<p id='5.20.9'><b>5.20.9</b> These I saw myself as they were being dug out.

<p id='5.21.1'><b>5.21.1</b> From this point my account will proceed to a description of the statues and votive offerings; but I think that it would be wrong to mix up the accounts of them.

The statues I will mention later; I will turn first to the votive offerings, and go over the most noteworthy of them. </p>
<p id='5.21.2'><b>5.21.2</b> As you go to the <pl id='Q4357227' data-wiki='Stadium_at_Olympia' title='Stadium (Olympia)'>stadium</pl> along the road from the <pl id='Q1925760' title='Metroon temple (Olympia)'>Metroum</pl>, there is on the left at the bottom of Mount <pl id='Q1250184' title='Kronios (Eleia)'>Cronios</pl> a platform of stone, right by the very mountain, with steps through it. By the platform have been set up bronze images of <prn id='Q34201' data-wiki='Zeus' title='Zeus (s. of Cronus), Jupiter'>Zeus</prn>.

<p id='5.21.3'><b>5.21.3</b> The first, six in number, were set up in the <prn id='Q57337789' title='Ol. 98th Olympiad (388 BCE) - Games at Ancient Olympia in 388 BCE'>ninety-eighth Olympiad</prn> (388 BCE). For <prn id='Q22978072' title='Eupolus - ancient Greek olympian'>Eupolus</prn> of <pl id='Q1247568' data-wiki='Ancient_Thessaly' title='Thessaly region (Hellas)'>Thessaly</pl> bribed the boxers who entered the competition, <prn id='Q126935018' title='Agetor of Arcadia - Olympic athlete accused on taking a bribe in 98th Olympiad'>Agetor</prn> the <pl id='Q12898802' data-wiki='Arcadia_(region)' title='Arkadia region (Arkadia)'>Arcadian</pl> and <prn id='Q16330121' data-wiki='Prytanis_of_Cyzicus' title='Prytanis of Cyzicus'>Prytanis</prn> of <pl id='Q615449' data-wiki='Cyzicus' title='Kyzikos (Mysia)'>Cyzicus</pl>, and with them also <prn id='Q22947047' title='Phormio of Halicarnassus - ancient Greek olympian'>Phormio</prn> of <pl id='Q5843680' data-wiki='Halicarnassus' title='Halikarnassos (Caria)'>Halicarnassus</pl>, who had won at the preceding Olympiad.

<p id='5.21.4'><b>5.21.4</b> Except the third and the fourth these images have elegiac inscriptions on them. The first of the inscriptions is intended to make plain that an <pl id='Q38888' data-wiki='Olympia,_Greece' title='Olympian Zeus sanctuary (Eleia)'>Olympic</pl> victory is to be won, not by money, but by swiftness of foot and strength of body. The inscription on the second image declares that the image stands to the glory of the deity, through the piety of the <pl id='Q6536845' data-wiki='Ancient_Elis' title='Eleia or Elis region (Eleia)'>Eleans</pl>, and to be a terror to law-breaking athletes. The purport of the inscription on the fifth image is praise of the <pl id='Q6536845' data-wiki='Ancient_Elis' title='Eleia or Elis region (Eleia)'>Eleans</pl>, especially for their fining the boxers; that of the sixth and last is that the images are a warning to all the Greeks not to give bribes to obtain an <pl id='Q38888' data-wiki='Olympia,_Greece' title='Olympian Zeus sanctuary (Eleia)'>Olympic</pl> victory. </p>
<p id='5.21.5'><b>5.21.5</b> Next after <prn id='Q22978072' title='Eupolus - ancient Greek olympian'>Eupolus</prn> they say that <prn id='Q11910957' title='Callippus - ancient Olympic victor'>Callippus</prn> of <pl id='Q844930' data-wiki='Classical_Athens' title='Athens (Attica)'>Athens</pl>, who had entered for the pentathlum, bought off his fellow-competitors by bribes, and that this offence occurred at the <prn id='Q57337805' title='Ol. 112th Olympiad (332 BCE) - 332 BCE'>hundred and twelfth Olympiad</prn> (332 BCE). When the fine had been imposed by the <pl id='Q6536845' data-wiki='Ancient_Elis' title='Eleia or Elis region (Eleia)'>Eleans</pl> on <prn id='Q11910957' title='Callippus - ancient Olympic victor'>Callippus</prn> and his antagonists, the <pl id='Q844930' data-wiki='Classical_Athens' title='Athens (Attica)'>Athenians</pl> commissioned <prn id='Q314447' data-wiki='Hypereides' title='Hypereides (orator) '>Hypereides</prn> to persuade the <pl id='Q6536845' data-wiki='Ancient_Elis' title='Eleia or Elis region (Eleia)'>Eleans</pl> to remit them the fine. The <pl id='Q6536845' data-wiki='Ancient_Elis' title='Eleia or Elis region (Eleia)'>Eleans</pl> refused this favour, and the <pl id='Q844930' data-wiki='Classical_Athens' title='Athens (Attica)'>Athenians</pl> were disdainful enough not to pay the money and to boycott the <prn id='Q188468' data-wiki='Ancient_Olympic_Games' title='Olympic Games'>Olympic games</prn>, until finally the god at <pl id='Q682558' data-wiki='Delphic_Oracle' title='Delphic Oracle, Pytho (Delphi)'>Delphi</pl> declared that he would deliver no oracle on any matter to the <pl id='Q844930' data-wiki='Classical_Athens' title='Athens (Attica)'>Athenians</pl> before they had paid the <pl id='Q6536845' data-wiki='Ancient_Elis' title='Eleia or Elis region (Eleia)'>Eleans</pl> the fine. </p>
<p id='5.21.6'><b>5.21.6</b> So when it was paid, images, also six in number, were made in honor of <prn id='Q34201' data-wiki='Zeus' title='Zeus (s. of Cronus), Jupiter'>Zeus</prn>; on them are inscribed elegiac verses not a whit more elegant than those relating the fine of <prn id='Q22978072' title='Eupolus - ancient Greek olympian'>Eupolus</prn>. The gist of the first inscription is that the images were dedicated because the god by an oracle expressed his approval of the <pl id='Q6536845' data-wiki='Ancient_Elis' title='Eleia or Elis region (Eleia)'>Elean</pl> decision against the pentathletes; on the second image and likewise on the third are praises of the <pl id='Q6536845' data-wiki='Ancient_Elis' title='Eleia or Elis region (Eleia)'>Eleans</pl> for their fining the competitors in the pentathlum. </p>
<p id='5.21.7'><b>5.21.7</b> The fourth purports to say that the contest at <pl id='Q38888' data-wiki='Olympia,_Greece' title='Olympian Zeus sanctuary (Eleia)'>Olympia</pl> is one of merit and not of wealth; the inscription on the fifth declares the reason for dedicating the images, while that on the sixth commemorates the oracle given to the <pl id='Q844930' data-wiki='Classical_Athens' title='Athens (Attica)'>Athenians</pl> by <pl id='Q682558' data-wiki='Delphic_Oracle' title='Delphic Oracle, Pytho (Delphi)'>Delphi</pl>. </p>
<p id='5.21.8'><b>5.21.8</b> The images next to those I have enumerated are two in number, and they were dedicated from a fine imposed on wrestlers. As to their names, neither I nor the guides of the <pl id='Q6536845' data-wiki='Ancient_Elis' title='Eleia or Elis region (Eleia)'>Eleans</pl> knew them. On these images too are inscriptions; one says that the <pl id='Q13533316' title='Rhodes (Dodecanese)'>Rhodians</pl> paid money to <prn id='Q106460486' title='Olympius, Olympian (divine epithet) - divine epithet of Zeus and other Greek deities'>Olympian</prn> <prn id='Q34201' data-wiki='Zeus' title='Zeus (s. of Cronus), Jupiter'>Zeus</prn> for the wrongdoing of a wrestler; the other that certain men wrestled for bribes and that the image was made from the fines imposed upon them. </p>
<p id='5.21.9'><b>5.21.9</b> The rest of the information about these athletes comes from the guides of the <pl id='Q6536845' data-wiki='Ancient_Elis' title='Eleia or Elis region (Eleia)'>Eleans</pl>, who say that it was at the <prn id='Q57337890' title='Ol. 178th Olympiad (68 BCE) - Ancient Olympic festival and epoch 68-64 BCE'>hundred and seventy-eighth Olympiad</prn> that <prn id='Q133228523' title='Eudelus - ancient wrestler  punished for accepting a bribe at Olympia'>Eudelus</prn> accepted a bribe from <prn id='Q133228208' title='Philostratus of Rhodes - wrestler allegedly punished for bribery at Olympia'>Philostratus</prn>, and that this <prn id='Q133228208' title='Philostratus of Rhodes - wrestler allegedly punished for bribery at Olympia'>Philostratus</prn> was a <pl id='Q13533316' title='Rhodes (Dodecanese)'>Rhodian</pl>.

On the side of the first of the <prn id='Q726' data-wiki='Horse' title='Horses, horse cavalry'>horses</prn> is an inscription, the first part of which is not metrical. It runs thus: “<prn id='Q106623461' title='Phormis of Maenalus - Arcadian military commander working in Sicily'>Phormis</prn> dedicated me, an <pl id='Q12898802' data-wiki='Arcadia_(region)' title='Arkadia region (Arkadia)'>Arcadian</pl> of <pl id='Q11936450' data-wiki='Maenalus' title='Mainalos (Arkadia)'>Maenalus</pl>, now of <pl id='Q4420718' title='Syracuse (Sicily)'>Syracuse</pl>.” </p>
<p id='5.27.3'><b>5.27.3</b> This is the <prn id='Q726' data-wiki='Horse' title='Horses, horse cavalry'>horse</prn> in which is, say the <pl id='Q6536845' data-wiki='Ancient_Elis' title='Eleia or Elis region (Eleia)'>Eleans</pl>, the hippomanes (what maddens <prn id='Q726' data-wiki='Horse' title='Horses, horse cavalry'>horses</prn>). It is plain to all that the quality of the <prn id='Q726' data-wiki='Horse' title='Horses, horse cavalry'>horse</prn> is the result of magic skill.

<p id='5.27.4'><b>5.27.4</b> In fact they rush into the <pl id='Q2400346' data-wiki='Altis' title='Altis sacred grove (Olympia)'>Altis</pl>, breaking their tethers or escaping from their grooms, and they leap upon it much more madly than upon a living brood mare, even the most beautiful of them.

<p id='5.27.5'><b>5.27.5</b> There is another marvel I know of, having seen it in <pl id='Q620765' data-wiki='Lydia' title='Lydia region (Asia Minor)'>Lydia</pl>; it is different from the <prn id='Q726' data-wiki='Horse' title='Horses, horse cavalry'>horse</prn> of <prn id='Q106623461' title='Phormis of Maenalus - Arcadian military commander working in Sicily'>Phormis</prn>, but like it not innocent of the magic art.

<p id='5.27.6'><b>5.27.6</b> Entering the chamber a magician piles dry wood upon the altar; he first places a tiara upon his head and then sings to some god or other an invocation in a foreign tongue unintelligible to Greeks, reciting the invocation from a book.

<p id='5.27.7'><b>5.27.7</b> So much for this subject.

About the offering at <pl id='Q38888' data-wiki='Olympia,_Greece' title='Olympian Zeus sanctuary (Eleia)'>Olympia</pl> I heard the following story. </p>
<p id='5.27.10'><b>5.27.10</b> Sitting under this <prn id='Q473194' data-wiki='Ox' title='Oxen'>ox</prn> a little boy was playing with his head bent towards the ground.

So the <pl id='Q6536845' data-wiki='Ancient_Elis' title='Eleia or Elis region (Eleia)'>Eleans</pl> were purposing to remove the <prn id='Q473194' data-wiki='Ox' title='Oxen'>ox</prn> from out the <pl id='Q2400346' data-wiki='Altis' title='Altis sacred grove (Olympia)'>Altis</pl> as being guilty of bloodshed. But the god at <pl id='Q682558' data-wiki='Delphic_Oracle' title='Delphic Oracle, Pytho (Delphi)'>Delphi</pl> gave an oracle that they were to let the offering stay where it was, after performing upon it the purificatory rites that are customary among the Greeks for unintentional shedding of blood. </p>
<p id='5.27.11'><b>5.27.11</b> Under the plane trees in the <pl id='Q2400346' data-wiki='Altis' title='Altis sacred grove (Olympia)'>Altis</pl>, just about in the center of the enclosure, there is a bronze trophy, with an inscription upon the shield of the trophy, to the effect that the <pl id='Q6536845' data-wiki='Ancient_Elis' title='Eleia or Elis region (Eleia)'>Eleans</pl> raised it as a sign that they had beaten the <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonians</pl>.

<p id='6.6.9'><b>6.6.9</b> So they performed the commands of the god and suffered no more terrors from the ghost.

The girl swore to marry him if he saved her, and so <prn id='Q8846610' title='Euthymos (legendary boxer) - Olympic boxer and hero from ancient Locris'>Euthymus</prn> with his armour on awaited the onslaught of the ghost. </p>

<p id='7.12.4'><b>7.12.4</b> The <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonians</pl> appealed to the Roman senate about a disputed territory, and the senate replied to the appeal by decreeing that all except capital cases should be under the jurisdiction of the <prn id='Q244796' data-wiki='Achaean_League' title='Achaean League'>Achaean League</prn>.

<p id='7.12.5'><b>7.12.5</b> So the <pl id='Q2790451' data-wiki='Achaea_(ancient_region)' title='Achaea region (Achaia)'>Achaeans</pl> claimed the right to try a <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonian</pl> on a capital charge, but the <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonians</pl> would not admit that <prn id='Q2066030' data-wiki='Diaeus' title='Diaeus'>Diaeus</prn> spoke the truth, and wished to refer the point to the Roman senate.

<p id='7.12.7'><b>7.12.7</b> When the <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Spartan</pl> senate inquired how many he considered were guilty, he reported to them the names of twenty-four citizens of the very front rank in <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Sparta</pl>.

<p id='7.13.1'><b>7.13.1</b> So the result of the debate was that the <pl id='Q2790451' data-wiki='Achaea_(ancient_region)' title='Achaea region (Achaia)'>Achaeans</pl> again came near to actual war with the <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Lacedemonians</pl>, and <prn id='Q4154428' title='Damocritus - politician, strategos of the Achaeans'>Damocritus</prn>, who had been elected general of the <pl id='Q2790451' data-wiki='Achaea_(ancient_region)' title='Achaea region (Achaia)'>Achaeans</pl> at this time, proceeded to mobilize an army against <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Sparta</pl>.

<p id='7.13.4'><b>7.13.4</b> If <prn id='Q4154428' title='Damocritus - politician, strategos of the Achaeans'>Damocritus</prn> had made a vigorous effort, the <pl id='Q2790451' data-wiki='Achaea_(ancient_region)' title='Achaea region (Achaia)'>Achaeans</pl> could have dashed into the walls of <pl id='Q5690' data-wiki='Sparta' title='Sparta/Lacedaemon (Lakonia)'>Sparta</pl> along with the fugitives from the field of battle. As it was, he at once recalled the <pl id='Q2790451' data-wiki='Achaea_(ancient_region)' title='Achaea region (Achaia)'>Achaeans</pl> from the pursuit, and confined his future operations to raids and plunder, instead of prosecuting the siege with energy. </p>
<p id='7.13.5'><b>7.13.5</b> So <prn id='Q4154428' title='Damocritus - politician, strategos of the Achaeans'>Damocritus</prn> withdrew his army, and the <pl id='Q2790451' data-wiki='Achaea_(ancient_region)' title='Achaea region (Achaia)'>Achaeans</pl> sentenced him to pay a fine of fifty talents for his treachery.

Who he was and for what reason he came to this land I shall set forth presently; but I must first describe what the condition of affairs was at his arrival. The <pl id='Q620874' data-wiki='Ionia' title='Ionia region (Asia Minor)'>Ionians</pl> who lived in <prn id='Q12874112' title='Aroe - ancient polis near Patrai'>Aroe</prn>, <pl id='Q12872273' data-wiki='Antheia_(Achaea)' title='Antheia? Ortos (Achaia)'>Antheia</pl> and <pl id='Q1658537' title='Mesatis? Voudeni exc. (Achaia)'>Mesatis</pl> had in common a precinct and a temple of <prn id='Q39503' data-wiki='Artemis' title='Artemis (d. of Zeus), Diana'>Artemis</prn> surnamed <prn id='Q106921266' title='Triclaria - divine epithet of Artemis in Achaea'>Triklaria</prn>, and in her honor the <pl id='Q620874' data-wiki='Ionia' title='Ionia region (Asia Minor)'>Ionians</pl> used to celebrate every year a festival and an all-night vigil. The priesthood of the goddess was held by a maiden until the time came for her to be sent to a husband. </p>
<p id='7.19.2'><b>7.19.2</b> Now the story is that once upon a time it happened that the priestess of the goddess was <prn id='Q58461838' title='Comaetho (s. of Pterelaus) - mythical priestess, lover of Melanippus'>Comaetho</prn>, a most beautiful maiden, who had a lover called <prn id='Q4289284' title='Melanippus - lover of Comaetho'>Melanippus</prn>, who was far better and handsomer than his fellows. When <prn id='Q4289284' title='Melanippus - lover of Comaetho'>Melanippus</prn> had won the love of the maiden, he asked the father for his daughter's hand. It is somehow a characteristic of old age to oppose the young in most things, and especially is it insensible to the desires of lovers. So <prn id='Q4289284' title='Melanippus - lover of Comaetho'>Melanippus</prn> found it; although both he and <prn id='Q58461838' title='Comaetho (s. of Pterelaus) - mythical priestess, lover of Melanippus'>Comaetho</prn> were eager to wed, he met with nothing but harshness from both his own parents and from those of his lover. </p>
<p id='7.19.3'><b>7.19.3</b> The history of <prn id='Q4289284' title='Melanippus - lover of Comaetho'>Melanippus</prn>, like that of many others, proved that love is apt both to break the laws of men and to desecrate the worship of the gods, seeing that this pair had their fill of the passion of love in the sanctuary of <prn id='Q39503' data-wiki='Artemis' title='Artemis (d. of Zeus), Diana'>Artemis</prn>. And hereafter also were they to use the sanctuary as a bridal-chamber. Forthwith the wrath of <prn id='Q39503' data-wiki='Artemis' title='Artemis (d. of Zeus), Diana'>Artemis</prn> began to destroy the inhabitants; the earth yielded no harvest, and strange diseases occurred of an unusually fatal character. </p>
<p id='7.19.4'><b>7.19.4</b> When they appealed to the oracle at <pl id='Q682558' data-wiki='Delphic_Oracle' title='Delphic Oracle, Pytho (Delphi)'>Delphi</pl> the <prn id='Q220344' data-wiki='Pythia' title='Pythia, oracular priestess at Delphi'>Pythian priestess</prn> accused <prn id='Q4289284' title='Melanippus - lover of Comaetho'>Melanippus</prn> and <prn id='Q58461838' title='Comaetho (s. of Pterelaus) - mythical priestess, lover of Melanippus'>Comaetho</prn>. The oracle ordered that they themselves should be sacrificed to <prn id='Q39503' data-wiki='Artemis' title='Artemis (d. of Zeus), Diana'>Artemis</prn>, and that every year a sacrifice should be made to the goddess of the fairest youth and the fairest maiden. Because of this sacrifice the river flowing by the sanctuary of <prn id='Q106921266' title='Triclaria - divine epithet of Artemis in Achaea'>Triclaria</prn> was called <pl id='Q3566497' data-wiki='Meilichos' title='Ameilichos R. (Achaia)'>Ameilichus</pl> (relentless). Previously the river had no name. </p>
<p id='7.19.5'><b>7.19.5</b> The innocent youths and maidens who perished because of <prn id='Q4289284' title='Melanippus - lover of Comaetho'>Melanippus</prn> and <prn id='Q58461838' title='Comaetho (s. of Pterelaus) - mythical priestess, lover of Melanippus'>Comaetho</prn> suffered a piteous fate, as did also their relatives; but the pair, I hold, were exempt from suffering, for the one thing that is worth a man's life is to be successful in love. </p>
<p id='7.19.6'><b>7.19.6</b> The sacrifice to <prn id='Q39503' data-wiki='Artemis' title='Artemis (d. of Zeus), Diana'>Artemis</prn> of human beings is said to have ceased in this way. An oracle had been given from <pl id='Q682558' data-wiki='Delphic_Oracle' title='Delphic Oracle, Pytho (Delphi)'>Delphi</pl> to the <pl id='Q133123' data-wiki='Patras' title='Patrai (Achaia)'>Patraeans</pl> even before this, to the effect that a strange king would come to the land, bringing with him a strange daimon, and this king would put an end to the sacrifice to <prn id='Q106921266' title='Triclaria - divine epithet of Artemis in Achaea'>Triclaria</prn>. When <pl id='Q22647' data-wiki='Troy' title='Troy/Ilion (Troad)'>Troy</pl> was captured, and the Greeks divided the spoils, <prn id='Q1588440' data-wiki='Eurypylus_of_Thessaly' title='Eurypylus of Thessaly'>Eurypylus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q3735337' title='Evaemon - mythical father of Eurypylus'>Euaemon</prn> got a chest. In it was an image of <prn id='Q41680' data-wiki='Dionysus' title='Dionysus (s. of Zeus), Bacchus'>Dionysus</prn>, the work, so they say, of <prn id='Q44384' data-wiki='Hephaestus' title='Hephaestus, Vulcan, (s. of Zeus)'>Hephaestus</prn>, and given as a gift by <prn id='Q34201' data-wiki='Zeus' title='Zeus (s. of Cronus), Jupiter'>Zeus</prn> to <prn id='Q461212' data-wiki='Dardanus_(son_of_Zeus)' title='Dardanus (son of Zeus)'>Dardanus</prn>. </p>
<p id='7.19.7'><b>7.19.7</b> But there are two other accounts of it. One is that this chest was left by <prn id='Q82732' data-wiki='Aeneas' title='Aeneas (s. of Anchises)'>Aeneas</prn> when he fled; the other that it was thrown away by <prn id='Q170779' data-wiki='Cassandra' title='Cassandra (d. of Priam)'>Cassandra</prn> to be a curse to the Greek who found it. Be this as it may, <prn id='Q1588440' data-wiki='Eurypylus_of_Thessaly' title='Eurypylus of Thessaly'>Eurypylus</prn> opened the chest, saw the image, and forthwith on seeing it went mad. He continued to be insane for the greater part of the time, with rare lucid intervals. Being in this condition he did not proceed on his voyage to <pl id='Q1247568' data-wiki='Ancient_Thessaly' title='Thessaly region (Hellas)'>Thessaly</pl>, but made for the town and gulf of <pl id='Q56754242' data-wiki='Cirrha' title='Kirrha (Phokis)'>Cirrha</pl>. Going up to <pl id='Q682558' data-wiki='Delphic_Oracle' title='Delphic Oracle, Pytho (Delphi)'>Delphi</pl> he inquired of the oracle about his illness. </p>
<p id='7.19.8'><b>7.19.8</b> They say that the oracle given him was to the effect that where he should come across a people offering a strange sacrifice, there he was to set down the chest and make his home. Now the ships of <prn id='Q1588440' data-wiki='Eurypylus_of_Thessaly' title='Eurypylus of Thessaly'>Eurypylus</prn> were carried down by the wind to the sea off <prn id='Q12874112' title='Aroe - ancient polis near Patrai'>Aroe</prn>. On landing he came across a youth and a maiden who had been brought to the altar of <prn id='Q106921266' title='Triclaria - divine epithet of Artemis in Achaea'>Triclaria</prn>. So <prn id='Q1588440' data-wiki='Eurypylus_of_Thessaly' title='Eurypylus of Thessaly'>Eurypylus</prn> found it easy to understand about the sacrifice, while the people of the place remembered their oracle seeing a king whom they had never seen before, they also suspected that the chest had some god inside it. </p>
<p id='7.19.9'><b>7.19.9</b> And so the malady of <prn id='Q1588440' data-wiki='Eurypylus_of_Thessaly' title='Eurypylus of Thessaly'>Eurypylus</prn> and the sacrifice of these people came to an end, and the river was given its present name <pl id='Q3566497' data-wiki='Meilichos' title='Ameilichos R.

Certain writers have said that the events I have related happened not to the <pl id='Q1247568' data-wiki='Ancient_Thessaly' title='Thessaly region (Hellas)'>Thessalian</pl> <prn id='Q1588440' data-wiki='Eurypylus_of_Thessaly' title='Eurypylus of Thessaly'>Eurypylus</prn>, but to <prn id='Q1378541' title='Eurypylus - son of Dexamenus'>Eurypylus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q3706015' title='Dexamenus - mythical king of Olenus in Achaea'>Dexamenus</prn> who was king in <pl id='Q11939304' data-wiki='Olenus_(Achaea)' title='Olenos (Achaia)'>Olenus</pl>, holding that this man joined <prn id='Q122248' data-wiki='Heracles' title='Heracles (s. of Zeus), Hercules'>Heracles</prn> in his campaign against <pl id='Q22647' data-wiki='Troy' title='Troy/Ilion (Troad)'>Troy</pl> and received the chest from <prn id='Q122248' data-wiki='Heracles' title='Heracles (s. of Zeus), Hercules'>Heracles</prn>.

<p id='7.19.10'><b>7.19.10</b> But I cannot bring myself to believe that <prn id='Q122248' data-wiki='Heracles' title='Heracles (s. of Zeus), Hercules'>Heracles</prn> did not know the facts about the chest, if they were as described, nor, if he were aware of them, do I think that he would ever have given it to an ally as a gift. Further, the people of <pl id='Q133123' data-wiki='Patras' title='Patrai (Achaia)'>Patrae</pl> have no tradition of a <prn id='Q1588440' data-wiki='Eurypylus_of_Thessaly' title='Eurypylus of Thessaly'>Eurypylus</prn> save the son of <prn id='Q3735337' title='Evaemon - mythical father of Eurypylus'>Euaemon</prn>, and to him every year they sacrifice as to a hero, when they celebrate the festival in honor of <prn id='Q41680' data-wiki='Dionysus' title='Dionysus (s. of Zeus), Bacchus'>Dionysus</prn>. </p>
<p id='7.20.1'><b>7.20.1</b> The surname of the god inside the chest is <prn id='Q5279412' data-wiki='Dionysus_Aesymnetes' title='Dionysus Aesymnetes'>Aesymnetes</prn> (Dictator), and his chief attendants are nine men, elected by the people from all the citizens for their reputation, and women equal in number to the men. On one night of the festival the priest carries the chest outside. Now this is a privilege that this night has received, and there go down to the river <pl id='Q3566497' data-wiki='Meilichos' title='Ameilichos R.

<p id='7.20.2'><b>7.20.2</b> But at the present day they lay aside the garlands of corn-ears by the goddess, and after bathing in the river and putting on fresh garlands, this time made of ivy, they go to the sanctuary of <prn id='Q5279412' data-wiki='Dionysus_Aesymnetes' title='Dionysus Aesymnetes'>Aesymnetes</prn>.

<p id='7.21.3'><b>7.21.3</b> On this occasion the oracles from <pl id='Q382317' data-wiki='Dodona' title='Dodona (Ioannina)'>Dodona</pl> declared that it was the wrath of <prn id='Q41680' data-wiki='Dionysus' title='Dionysus (s. of Zeus), Bacchus'>Dionysus</prn> that caused the plague, which would not cease until <prn id='Q1784380' title='Coresus - mythical wooer of Callirhoe'>Coresus</prn> sacrificed to <prn id='Q41680' data-wiki='Dionysus' title='Dionysus (s. of Zeus), Bacchus'>Dionysus</prn> either <prn id='Q525524' data-wiki='Callirho%C3%AB_(Calydon)' title='Callirhoe'>Callirhoe</prn> herself or one who had the courage to die in her stead.

It is called the sanctuary of <prn id='Q6132631' data-wiki='Soteria_(mythology)' title='Soteria (mythology)'>Soteria</prn> (salvation), and the story is that it was originally founded by <prn id='Q1588440' data-wiki='Eurypylus_of_Thessaly' title='Eurypylus of Thessaly'>Eurypylus</prn> on being cured of his madness. At the harbor is a temple of <prn id='Q41127' data-wiki='Poseidon' title='Poseidon (s. of Cronus), Neptune'>Poseidon</prn> with a standing image of stone. Besides the names given by poets to <prn id='Q41127' data-wiki='Poseidon' title='Poseidon (s. of Cronus), Neptune'>Poseidon</prn> to adorn their verses, and in addition to his local names, all men give him the following surnames — <prn id='Q16737846' title='Pelagaios (epithet) - epithet of Poseidon, of the sea'>Pelagaios</prn> (marine), <prn id='Q55804838' title='Asphalius - epithet of Poseidon'>Asphalios</prn> (safety-giver), <prn id='Q20100719' title='Hippius, Hippia - divine epithet, pertaining to horses, primarily of Poseidon'>Hippios</prn> (horse). </p>
<p id='7.21.8'><b>7.21.8</b> Various reasons could be plausibly assigned for the last of these surnames having been given to the god, but my own conjecture is that he got this name as the inventor of horsemanship. <prn id='Q6691' data-wiki='Homer' title='Homer (poet) '>Homer</prn>, at any rate, when describing the chariot-race, puts into the mouth of <prn id='Q171839' data-wiki='Menelaus' title='Menelaus (s. of Atreus)'>Menelaus</prn> a challenge to swear an oath by this god: “Touch the <prn id='Q726' data-wiki='Horse' title='Horses, horse cavalry'>horses</prn>, and swear by the <prn id='Q106517783' title='Gaeaochus - epithet of Poseidon as earth-holder and god of earthquakes'>Gaieochos</prn> (earth-holder), <prn id='Q60449380' title='Ennosigaeus - epithet of Poseidon Earthholder'>Ennosigaios</prn> (earth-shaker), That thou didst not intentionally, through guile, obstruct my chariot.” </p>

On the side of this towards the temple stands a wall of stones, while on the outer side has been made a descent to the spring. Here there is an infallible oracle, not indeed for everything, but only in the case of sick folk. They tie a mirror to a fine cord and let it down, judging the distance so that it does not sink deep into the spring, but just far enough to touch the water with its rim. Then they pray to the goddess and burn incense, after which they look into the mirror, which shows them the patient either alive or dead. </p>

<p id='7.24.7'><b>7.24.7</b> Warnings, usually the same in all cases, are wont to be sent by the god before violent and far-reaching earthquakes. Either continuous storms of rain or else continuous droughts occur before earthquakes for an unusual length of time, and the weather is unseasonable. In winter it turns too hot, and in summer along with a tendency to haze the orb of the sun presents an unusual color, slightly inclining to red or else to black. </p>
<p id='7.24.8'><b>7.24.8</b> Springs of water generally dry up; blasts of wind sometimes swoop upon the land and overturn the trees; occasionally great flames dart across the sky; the shapes of stars too appear such as have never been witnessed before, producing consternation in those that witness them; furthermore there is a violent rumbling of winds beneath the earth — these and many other warnings is the god wont to send before violent earthquakes occur. </p>
<p id='7.24.9'><b>7.24.9</b> The shock itself is not of one fixed type, but the original inquirers into such matters and their pupils have been able to discover the following forms of earthquake. The mildest form — that is, if such a calamity admits of mitigation — is when there coincides with the original shock, which levels the buildings with the ground, a shock in the opposite direction, counteracting the first and raising up the buildings already knocked over. </p>
<p id='7.24.10'><b>7.24.10</b> In this form of' earthquake pillars may be seen righting themselves which have been almost entirely uprooted, split walls coming together to their original position; beams, dislocated by the shock, go back to their places, and likewise channels, and such-like means of furthering the flow of water, have their cracks cemented better than they could be by human craftsmen. Now the second form of earthquake brings destruction to anything liable to it, and it throws over at once, as it were by a battering-ram, whatever meets the force of its impact. </p>
<p id='7.24.11'><b>7.24.11</b> The most destructive kind of earthquake the experts are wont to liken to the symptoms of a man suffering from a non-intermittent fever, the breathing of such a patient being rapid and laboured. There are symptoms of this to be found in many parts of the body, especially at each wrist. In the same way, they say, the earthquake dives directly under buildings and shakes up their foundations, just as molehills come up from the bowels of the earth. It is this sort of shock alone that leaves no trace on the ground that men ever dwelt there. </p>
<p id='7.24.12'><b>7.24.12</b> This was the type of earthquake, they say, that on the occasion referred to levelled <pl id='Q1432654' data-wiki='Helike' title='Helike (Achaia)'>Helice</pl> to the ground, and that it was accompanied by another disaster in the season of winter. The sea flooded a great part of the land, and covered up the whole of <pl id='Q1432654' data-wiki='Helike' title='Helike (Achaia)'>Helice</pl> all round.

<p id='7.24.13'><b>7.24.13</b> A similar fate, though different in type, came upon a city on Mount <pl id='Q532698' data-wiki='Mount_Sipylus' title='Sipylos Mt.

For the men of those days, because of their righteousness and piety, were guests of the gods, eating at the same board; the good were openly honored by the gods, and sinners were openly visited with their wrath.

In the days of old those Greeks who were considered wise spoke their sayings not straight out but in riddles, and so the legends about <prn id='Q44204' data-wiki='Cronus' title='Cronus (s. of Uranus), Saturn'>Cronus</prn> I conjectured to be one sort of Greek wisdom.

<p id='8.10.3'><b>8.10.3</b> They set up no barrier at the entrance to prevent men going inside; but they stretched across it a thread of wool.

<p id='8.22.3'><b>8.22.3</b> The modern city contains none of these sanctuaries, but I found the following notable things. In the <pl id='Q2359730' data-wiki='Stymphalus_(Arcadia)' title='Stymphalos (Korinthia)'>Stymphalian</pl> territory is a spring, from which the emperor <pl id='Q56295608' title='Hadrianic aqueduct (Korinthia)'>Hadrian brought water</pl> to <pl id='Q1363688' data-wiki='Ancient_Corinth' title='Corinth/Korinthos (Korinthia)'>Corinth</pl>.

This river descends into a chasm in the earth, and reappearing once more in <pl id='Q12649101' title='Argolid region (Peloponnese)'>Argolis</pl> it changes its name, and is called <pl id='Q12877267' title='Erasinos R.

<p id='8.22.4'><b>8.22.4</b> There is a story current about the water of the <pl id='Q2359730' data-wiki='Stymphalus_(Arcadia)' title='Stymphalos (Korinthia)'>Stymphalus</pl>, that at one time man-eating birds bred on it, which <prn id='Q122248' data-wiki='Heracles' title='Heracles (s. of Zeus), Hercules'>Heracles</prn> is said to have shot down. <prn id='Q1233081' data-wiki='Peisander' title='Peisander'>Peisander</prn> the <pl id='Q1231539' data-wiki='Camirus' title='Kamiros (Rhodes)'>Kamirean</pl>, however, says that <prn id='Q122248' data-wiki='Heracles' title='Heracles (s. of Zeus), Hercules'>Heracles</prn> did not kill the birds, but drove them away with the noise of rattles.

<p id='8.22.5'><b>8.22.5</b> These fly against those who come to hunt them, wounding and killing them with their beaks.

But the fame of <prn id='Q122248' data-wiki='Heracles' title='Heracles (s. of Zeus), Hercules'>Heracles</prn>, and the superiority of the Greek over the foreigner, has resulted in the birds of the  <pl id='Q57751375' data-wiki='Arabian' title='Arabia region (Asia)'>Arabian</pl> desert being called <pl id='Q2359730' data-wiki='Stymphalus_(Arcadia)' title='Stymphalos (Korinthia)'>Stymphalian</pl> even in modern times. </p>

<p id='8.22.8'><b>8.22.8</b> Even in our own day the following miracle is said to have occurred.

<p id='8.22.9'><b>8.22.9</b> They also say that a hunter chased a deer, which fled and plunged into the marsh, followed by the hunter, who, in the excitement of the hunt, swam after the deer. So the chasm swallowed up both the deer and her pursuer. They are said to have been followed by the water of the river, so that by the next day the whole of the water was dried up that flooded the <pl id='Q2359730' data-wiki='Stymphalus_(Arcadia)' title='Stymphalos (Korinthia)'>Stymphalian</pl> plain.

A little beyond the city is a spring, and by the spring grows a large and beautiful plane tree.

<p id='8.42.13'><b>8.42.13</b> The oldest, however, of the inhabitants I met said that three generations before his time some stones had fallen on the image out of the roof; these crushed the image, destroying it utterly.

<p id='8.43.2'><b>8.43.2</b> Well, the story is that the wisest man and the best soldier among the <pl id='Q12898802' data-wiki='Arcadia_(region)' title='Arkadia region (Arkadia)'>Arcadians</pl> was one <prn id='Q837699' data-wiki='Evander_of_Pallantium' title='Evander of Pallene or Pallantium'>Evander</prn>, whose mother was a <prn id='Q12134676' title='Nicostrate - Greek nymph, mother of Evander'>nymph</prn>, a daughter of the <pl id='Q1462727' data-wiki='Ladon_(river)' title='Ladon R.

<p id='8.43.3'><b>8.43.3</b> <prn id='Q1429' data-wiki='Antoninus_Pius' title='Antoninus Pius (Roman emperor 138-161 CE)'>Antoninus</prn>, the benefactor of <pl id='Q11939941' data-wiki='Pallantium_(Arcadia)' title='Pallantion (Arkadia)'>Pallantium</pl>, never willingly involved the <pl id='Q18287233' title='Rome (Italy)'>Romans</pl> in war; but when the Moors (who form the greatest part of the independent <pl id='Q2370577' data-wiki='Ancient_Libya' title='Libya (Africa)'>Libyans</pl>, being nomads, and more formidable enemies than even the <pl id='Q845909' data-wiki='Scythia' title='Scythia (Pontus)'>Scythians</pl> in that they wandered, not on wagons, but on horseback with their womenfolk), when these, I say, began an unprovoked war, he drove them from all their country, forcing them to flee to the extreme parts of <pl id='Q2370577' data-wiki='Ancient_Libya' title='Libya (Africa)'>Libya</pl>, right up to <pl id='Q130135' data-wiki='Atlas_Mountains' title='Mount Atlas (Africa)'>Mount Atlas</pl> and to the people living on it. </p>
<p id='8.43.4'><b>8.43.4</b> He also took away from the <prn id='Q500393' title='Brigantes (tribe, Britain) - British tribe of the Iron Age and Roman era'>Brigantes</prn> in <pl id='Q23666' data-wiki='Roman_Britain' title='Britannia Albion (Atlantic)'>Britain</pl> the greater part of their territory, because they too had begun an unprovoked war on the province of Genunia, a Roman dependency.

<p id='8.43.5'><b>8.43.5</b> But there is also another memorial of himself left by this emperor. There was a certain law whereby provincials who were themselves of Roman citizenship, while their children were considered of Greek nationality, were forced either to leave their property to strangers or let it increase the wealth of the emperor. <prn id='Q1429' data-wiki='Antoninus_Pius' title='Antoninus Pius (Roman emperor 138-161 CE)'>Antoninus</prn> permitted all such to give to the children their heritage, choosing rather to show himself benevolent than to retain a law that swelled his riches.

<p id='8.43.6'><b>8.43.6</b> In my opinion he might also be justly called by the same title as the elder <prn id='Q8423' data-wiki='Cyrus_the_Great' title='Cyrus (kings of Persia)'>Cyrus</prn>, who was styled Father of Men. He left to succeed him a son of the same name.

The <prn id='Q38012' data-wiki='Hera' title='Hera (d. of Cronus), Juno'>Hera</prn> they call <prn id='Q21547923' title='Teleios/Teleia - divine epithet of Zeus and Hera, meaning adult or perfect'>Teleia</prn> (full-grown); it is an upright statue of huge size.

Here too is another statue of <prn id='Q38012' data-wiki='Hera' title='Hera (d. of Cronus), Juno'>Hera</prn>; it is seated, and was made by <prn id='Q553631' data-wiki='Callimachus_(sculptor)' title='Callimachus (sculptor)'>Callimachus</prn>. The goddess they call the Bride (nympheuomene) for the following reason. </p>
<p id='9.3.1'><b>9.3.1</b> <prn id='Q38012' data-wiki='Hera' title='Hera (d. of Cronus), Juno'>Hera</prn>, they say, was for some reason or other angry with <prn id='Q34201' data-wiki='Zeus' title='Zeus (s. of Cronus), Jupiter'>Zeus</prn>, and had retreated to <pl id='Q173096' data-wiki='Euboea' title='Euboia (Euboea)'>Euboea</pl>. <prn id='Q34201' data-wiki='Zeus' title='Zeus (s. of Cronus), Jupiter'>Zeus</prn>, failing to make her change her mind, visited <prn id='Q2974445' title='Cithaeron - mythical king of Plataea'>Cithaeron</prn>, at that time despot in <pl id='Q742538' data-wiki='Plataea' title='Plataea (Boeotia)'>Plataea</pl>, who surpassed all men for his cleverness. So he ordered <prn id='Q34201' data-wiki='Zeus' title='Zeus (s. of Cronus), Jupiter'>Zeus</prn> to make an image of wood, and to carry it, wrapped up, in a bullock wagon, and to say that he was celebrating his marriage with <prn id='Q6078094' data-wiki='Plataea_(mythology)' title='Plataea'>Plataea</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q622781' data-wiki='Asopus' title='Asopus (s. of Oceanus)'>Asopus</prn>. </p>
<p id='9.3.2'><b>9.3.2</b> So <prn id='Q34201' data-wiki='Zeus' title='Zeus (s. of Cronus), Jupiter'>Zeus</prn> followed the advice of <prn id='Q2974445' title='Cithaeron - mythical king of Plataea'>Cithaeron</prn>. <prn id='Q38012' data-wiki='Hera' title='Hera (d. of Cronus), Juno'>Hera</prn> heard the news at once, and at once appeared on the scene. But when she came near the wagon and tore away the dress from the image, she was pleased at the deceit, on finding it a wooden image and not a bride, and was reconciled to <prn id='Q34201' data-wiki='Zeus' title='Zeus (s. of Cronus), Jupiter'>Zeus</prn>. To commemorate this reconciliation they celebrate a festival called <prn id='Q5208152' data-wiki='Daedala' title='Daedala'>Daedala</prn>, because the men of old time gave the name of daedala to <prn id='Q693222' data-wiki='Xoanon' title='Xoanon (cult statue)'>xoana</prn>. My own view is that this name was given to <prn id='Q693222' data-wiki='Xoanon' title='Xoanon (cult statue)'>xoana</prn> before <prn id='Q134756' data-wiki='Daedalus' title='Daedalus (s. of Eupalamus)'>Daedalus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q3562019' data-wiki='Eupalamus' title='Eupalamus'>Palamaon</prn>, was born at <pl id='Q844930' data-wiki='Classical_Athens' title='Athens (Attica)'>Athens</pl>, and that he did not receive this name at birth, but that it was a surname afterwards given him from the daedala. </p>
<p id='9.3.3'><b>9.3.3</b> So the <pl id='Q742538' data-wiki='Plataea' title='Plataea (Boeotia)'>Plataeans</pl> hold the festival of the <prn id='Q5208152' data-wiki='Daedala' title='Daedala'>Daedala</prn> every six years, according to the local guide, but really at a shorter interval. I wanted very much to calculate exactly the interval between one Daedala and the next, but I was unable to do so. In this way they celebrate the feast. </p>

To this grove come the <pl id='Q742538' data-wiki='Plataea' title='Plataea (Boeotia)'>Plataeans</pl>, and lay out portions of boiled flesh. They keep a strict watch on the <prn id='Q43365' data-wiki='Corvus' title='Crows'>crows</prn> which flock to them, but they are not troubled at all about the other birds. They mark carefully the tree on which a <prn id='Q43365' data-wiki='Corvus' title='Crows'>crow</prn> settles with the meat he has seized. They cut down the trunk of the tree on which the <prn id='Q43365' data-wiki='Corvus' title='Crows'>crow</prn> has settled, and make of it the daedalum; for this is the name that they give to the wooden image also. </p>
<p id='9.3.5'><b>9.3.5</b> This feast the <pl id='Q742538' data-wiki='Plataea' title='Plataea (Boeotia)'>Plataeans</pl> celebrate by themselves, calling it the Little Daedala, but the Great Daedala, which is shared with them by the <pl id='Q187570' title='Boiotia region (Boeotia)'>Boeotians</pl>, is a festival held at intervals of fifty-nine years, for that is the period during which, they say, the festival could not be held, as the <pl id='Q742538' data-wiki='Plataea' title='Plataea (Boeotia)'>Plataeans</pl> were in exile. There are fourteen <prn id='Q693222' data-wiki='Xoanon' title='Xoanon (cult statue)'>xoana</prn> ready, having been provided each year at the Little Daedala. </p>

On the peak of the mountain an altar has been prepared, which they make after the following way.

<p id='9.8.6'><b>9.8.6</b> The name <prn id='Q135495756' title='Homoloid  gate - gate of Thebes in ancient Greek legend'>Homoloid</prn> is derived, they say, from the following circumstance.

The god, it is said, heard their cry and overcame the <prn id='Q4463225' title='Triton - merman in Greek mythology'>Triton</prn> in the fight. </p>
<p id='9.20.5'><b>9.20.5</b> The other version is less grand but more credible.

He used even to attack small vessels, until the people of <pl id='Q56259452' title='Tanagra (Boeotia)'>Tanagra</pl> set out for him a bowl of wine. They say that, attracted by the smell, he came at once, drank the wine, flung himself on the shore and slept, and that a man of <pl id='Q56259452' title='Tanagra (Boeotia)'>Tanagra</pl> struck him on the neck with an axe and chopped off his head.

And because they caught him drunk, it is supposed that it was <prn id='Q41680' data-wiki='Dionysus' title='Dionysus (s. of Zeus), Bacchus'>Dionysus</prn> who killed him. </p>
<p id='9.21.1'><b>9.21.1</b> I saw another <prn id='Q4463225' title='Triton - merman in Greek mythology'>Triton</prn> among the curiosities at <pl id='Q18287233' title='Rome (Italy)'>Rome</pl>, less in size than the one at <pl id='Q56259452' title='Tanagra (Boeotia)'>Tanagra</pl>. The <prn id='Q4463225' title='Triton - merman in Greek mythology'>Tritons</prn> have the following appearance. On their heads they grow hair like that of marsh frogs not only in color, but also in the impossibility of separating one hair from another. The rest of their body is rough with fine scales just as is the shark. Under their ears they have gills and a man's nose; but the mouth is broader and the teeth are those of a beast. Their eyes seem to me blue, and they have hands, fingers, and nails like the shells of the murex. Under the breast and belly is a tail like a <prn id='Q7369' data-wiki='Dolphin' title='Dolphins, porpoises'>dolphin</prn>'s instead of feet. </p>
<p id='9.21.2'><b>9.21.2</b> I saw also the Ethiopian <prn id='Q693690' data-wiki='Bull' title='Bulls'>bulls</prn>, called rhinoceroses owing to the fact that each has one horn (ceras) at the end of the nose (rhis), over which is another but smaller one, but there is no trace of horns on their heads. I saw too the <pl id='Q249561' data-wiki='Paeonia_(kingdom)' title='Paionia region (Macedonia)'>Paeonian</pl> <prn id='Q693690' data-wiki='Bull' title='Bulls'>bulls</prn>, which are shaggy all over, but especially about the chest and lower jaw.

<p id='9.21.3'><b>9.21.3</b> There is also a beast called the elk, in form between a deer and a <prn id='Q7375' data-wiki='Camel' title='Camels'>camel</prn>, which breeds in the land of the <pl id='Q35966' data-wiki='Celts' title='Keltike (Europe)'>Celts</pl>. Of all the beasts we know it alone cannot be tracked or seen at a distance by man; sometimes, however, when men are out hunting other game they fall in with an elk by luck. Now they say that it smells man even at a great distance, and dashes down into ravines or the deepest caverns. So the hunters surround the plain or mountain in a circuit of at least a thousand stades, and, taking care not to break the circle, they keep on narrowing the area enclosed, and so catch all the beasts inside, the elks included. But if there chance to be no lair within, there is no other way of catching the elk. </p>
<p id='9.21.4'><b>9.21.4</b> The beast described by <prn id='Q296325' data-wiki='Ctesias' title='Ctesias (physician and historian)'>Ctesias</prn> in his <pl id='Q17055962' data-wiki='India_(Herodotus)' title='India (Asia)'>Indian</pl> history, which he says is called <prn id='Q223795' data-wiki='Manticore' title='manticore'>martichoras</prn> by the <pl id='Q17055962' data-wiki='India_(Herodotus)' title='India (Asia)'>Indians</pl> and man-eater by the Greeks, I am inclined to think is the tiger. But that it has three rows of teeth along each jaw and spikes at the tip of its tail with which it defends itself at close quarters, while it hurls them like an archer's arrows at more distant enemies; all this is, I think, a false story that the <pl id='Q17055962' data-wiki='India_(Herodotus)' title='India (Asia)'>Indians</pl> pass on from one to another owing to their excessive dread of the beast. </p>
<p id='9.21.5'><b>9.21.5</b> They were also deceived about its color, and whenever the tiger showed itself in the light of the sun it appeared to be a homogeneous red, either because of its speed, or, if it were not running, because of its continual twists and turns, especially when it was not seen at close quarters. And I think that if one were to traverse the most remote parts of <pl id='Q2370577' data-wiki='Ancient_Libya' title='Libya (Africa)'>Libya</pl>, <pl id='Q17055962' data-wiki='India_(Herodotus)' title='India (Asia)'>India</pl> or <pl id='Q57751375' data-wiki='Arabian' title='Arabia region (Asia)'>Arabia</pl>, in search of such beasts as are found in Greece, some he would not discover at all, and others would have a different appearance. </p>
<p id='9.21.6'><b>9.21.6</b> For man is not the only creature that has a different appearance in different climates and in different countries; the others too obey the same rule. For instance, the Libyan asps have a different colors compared with the <pl id='Q11768' data-wiki='Ancient_Egypt' title='Aigyptos (Egypt)'>Egyptian</pl>, while in <pl id='Q410453' data-wiki='Aethiopia' title='Aethiopia (Africa)'>Ethiopia</pl> are bred asps quite as black as the men.

<p id='9.28.2'><b>9.28.2</b> Now the poison of the most venomous <prn id='Q192056' data-wiki='Vipera_berus' title='vipers'>snakes</prn> is of itself deadly to men and all animals alike, but what they feed on contributes very much to the strength of their poison; for instance, I learnt from a <pl id='Q41642' data-wiki='Phoenicia' title='Phoenicia (Lebanon)'>Phoenician</pl> that the roots they eat make more venomous the <prn id='Q192056' data-wiki='Vipera_berus' title='vipers'>vipers</prn> in the highland of <pl id='Q41642' data-wiki='Phoenicia' title='Phoenicia (Lebanon)'>Phoenicia</pl>.

After looking at the agalma which they say was made by <prn id='Q134756' data-wiki='Daedalus' title='Daedalus (s. of Eupalamus)'>Daedalus</prn> (it is not shown by the priests save to such as are going to visit <prn id='Q1166183' data-wiki='Trophonius' title='Trophonius (s. of Erginus)'>Trophonius</prn>), having seen it, worshipped it and prayed, he proceeds to the oracle, dressed in a linen tunic, with ribbons girding it, and wearing the boots of the country. </p>
<p id='9.39.9'><b>9.39.9</b> The oracle is on the mountain, beyond the grove. Round it is a circular basement (crepis) of white marble, the circumference of which is about that of the smallest threshing floor, while its height is just short of two cubits. On the basement stand spikes, which, like the cross-bars holding them together, are of bronze, while through them has been made a double door. Within the enclosure is a chasm in the earth, not natural, but artificially constructed after the most accurate masonry. </p>
<p id='9.39.10'><b>9.39.10</b> The shape of this structure is like that of a bread-oven. Its breadth across the middle one might conjecture to be about four cubits, and its depth also could not be estimated to extend to more than eight cubits. They have made no way of descent to the bottom, but when a man comes to <prn id='Q1166183' data-wiki='Trophonius' title='Trophonius (s. of Erginus)'>Trophonius</prn>, they bring him a narrow, light ladder. After going down he finds a hole between the floor and the structure. Its breadth appeared to be two spans, and its height one span. </p>
<p id='9.39.11'><b>9.39.11</b> The descender lies with his back on the ground, holding barley-cakes kneaded with honey, thrusts his feet into the hole and himself follows, trying hard to get his knees into the hole. After his knees the rest of his body is at once swiftly drawn in, just as the largest and most rapid river will catch a man in its eddy and carry him under. After this those who have entered the adyton learn the future, not in one and the same way in all cases, but by sight sometimes and at other times by hearing. The return upwards is by the same mouth, the feet darting out first. </p>
<p id='9.39.12'><b>9.39.12</b> They say that no one who has made the descent has been killed, save only one of the bodyguard of <prn id='Q59734' data-wiki='Demetrius_I_of_Macedon' title='Demetrius I Poliorcetes (Antigonid king)'>Demetrius</prn>. But they declare that he performed none of the usual rites in the sanctuary, and that he descended, not to consult the god but in the hope of stealing gold and silver from the shrine. It is said that the body of this man appeared in a different place, and was not cast out at the sacred mouth. Other tales are told about the fellow, but I have given the one most worthy of consideration. </p>

After gaining this information they then entrust him to his relatives. These lift him, paralyzed with terror and unconscious both of himself and of his surroundings, and carry him to the building where he lodged before with <prn id='Q213440' data-wiki='Tyche' title='Tyche (d. of Oceanus), Fortune'>Good Fortune</prn> and the <prn id='Q391553' data-wiki='Agathodaemon' title='Agathos Daimon Good Spirit'>Good Daimon</prn>.

<p id='10.19.10'><b>10.19.10</b> When the Gallic horsemen were engaged, the servants remained behind the ranks and proved useful in the following way.

Slashed with axe or sword they kept their desperation while they still breathed; pierced by arrow or javelin, they did not abate of their passion so long as life remained.

The <pl id='Q35966' data-wiki='Celts' title='Keltike (Europe)'>Celts</pl> were in unspeakable distress, and as in the confined space they inflicted few losses but suffered twice or four times as many, their captains gave the signal to retire to their camp.

<p id='10.21.7'><b>10.21.7</b> There were in my opinion two reasons that made them careless about the burial of their dead: they wished to strike terror into their enemies, and through habit they have no tender feeling for those who have gone.

The third story says that the exhalations from a certain river, and its very water, have a peculiar smell; the fourth, that asphodel grows in great abundance and when in flower . . . because of the smell. </p>
<p id='10.38.3'><b>10.38.3</b> Another story says that the first dwellers here were aboriginals, but as yet not knowing how to weave garments they used to make themselves a protection against the cold out of the untanned skins of beasts, turning outwards the shaggy side of the skins for the sake of a good appearance. So their own skins were sure to smell as badly as did the hides. </p>
<p id='10.38.4'><b>10.38.4</b> One hundred and twenty stades away from <pl id='Q682558' data-wiki='Delphic_Oracle' title='Delphic Oracle, Pytho (Delphi)'>Delphi</pl> is <pl id='Q38281545' title='Amphissa (Phokis)'>Amphissa</pl>, the largest and most renowned city of <pl id='Q4894785' data-wiki='Ozolian_Locris' title='Ozolian Lokris region (Phokis)'>Locris</pl>.

Support is given to this view by the fact that, when the Roman emperor drove the <pl id='Q26857' data-wiki='Aetolia' title='Aitolia region (Aitolia)'>Aetolians</pl> from their homes in order to found the new city of <pl id='Q943637' data-wiki='Nicopolis' title='Nicopolis (Preveza)'>Nicopolis</pl>, the greater part of the people went away to <pl id='Q38281545' title='Amphissa (Phokis)'>Amphissa</pl>. Originally, however, they came of <pl id='Q4894785' data-wiki='Ozolian_Locris' title='Ozolian Lokris region (Phokis)'>Locrian</pl> race. It is said that the name of the city is derived from <prn id='Q2322495' data-wiki='Amphissa_(daughter_of_Macareus)' title='Amphissa daughter of Macar'>Amphissa</prn>, daughter of <prn id='Q9026462' data-wiki='Macareus_(son_of_Aeolus)' title='Macar (s. of Helios)'>Macar</prn>, son of <prn id='Q172549' data-wiki='Aeolus_(Odyssey)' title='Aeolus (Odyssey)'>Aeolus</prn>, and that <prn id='Q37340' data-wiki='Apollo' title='Apollo (s. of Zeus) (cf Phoebus)'>Apollo</prn> was her lover. </p>
<p id='10.38.5'><b>10.38.5</b> The city is beautifully constructed, and its most notable objects are the tomb of <prn id='Q2322495' data-wiki='Amphissa_(daughter_of_Macareus)' title='Amphissa daughter of Macar'>Amphissa</prn> and the tomb of <prn id='Q16335866' title='Andraemon - mythical father of Thoas'>Andraemon</prn>.

<p id='10.38.6'><b>10.38.6</b> For I have stated in an earlier part of my work that two <pl id='Q13580795' title='Samos (Aegean)'>Samians</pl>, <prn id='Q1851693' data-wiki='Rhoecus' title='Rhoecus (sculptor)'>Rhoecus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q1615450' title='Philaeus (s. of Aeas) - mythical son of Ajax the Great'>Philaeus</prn>, and <prn id='Q3286634' data-wiki='Theodorus_of_Samos' title='Theodorus of Samos'>Theodorus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q3982788' title='Telecles of Samos - ancient Greek sculptor'>Telecles</prn>, discovered how to found bronze most perfectly, and were the first casters of that metal.

The sacrifices to the <prn id='Q1637673' data-wiki='Meilichios' title='Meilichios'>Meilichioi</prn> are offered at night, and their rule is to consume the meat on the spot before sunrise. Beyond the city is a precinct of <prn id='Q41127' data-wiki='Poseidon' title='Poseidon (s. of Cronus), Neptune'>Poseidon</prn>, called Poseidonium, and a temple of <prn id='Q41127' data-wiki='Poseidon' title='Poseidon (s. of Cronus), Neptune'>Poseidon</prn> is in it.

<p id='10.38.10'><b>10.38.10</b> I gather that the city got its name from a woman or a nymph, while as for <pl id='Q56398924' title='Naupactus (Aitolia)'>Naupactus</pl>, I have heard it said that the <prn id='Q203711' data-wiki='Dorians' title='Dorians'>Dorians</prn> under the sons of <prn id='Q311536' title='Aristomachus - one of the Heracleidae, a great-grandson of Heracles'>Aristomachus</prn> built here the vessels in which they crossed to the <pl id='Q78967' data-wiki='Peloponnese' title='Peloponnese (Hellas)'>Peloponnesus</pl>, thus, it is said, giving to the place its name.

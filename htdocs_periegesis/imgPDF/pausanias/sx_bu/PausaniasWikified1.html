Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1918. A work in the public domain, translation adapted/corrected by Brady Kiesling for ToposText.

<p id='1.1.1'><b>1.1.1</b> BOOK 1 <br>On the Greek mainland facing the <pl id='Q171132'>Cyclades</pl> Islands and the <pl id='Q34575'>Aegean Sea</pl> the <pl id='Q1136637'>Sunium</pl> promontory stands out from the <pl id='Q122443'>Attic</pl> land. When you have rounded the promontory you see a harbor and a <pl id='Q24204542'>temple</pl> to <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> <prn id='Q107349715'>Sounias</prn> on the peak of the promontory. Farther on is <pl id='Q985449'>Laurium</pl>, where once the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> had silver mines, and a small uninhabited island called the <pl id='Q1145107'>Island of Patroclus</pl>. For a fortification was built on it and a palisade constructed by <prn id='Q762982'>Patroclus</prn>, who was admiral in command of the <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptian</pl> men-of-war sent by <prn id='Q39576'>Ptolemy</prn>, son of <prn id='Q168261'>Ptolemy</prn>, son of <prn id='Q718154'>Lagus</prn>, to help the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, when <prn id='Q241386'>Antigonus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q59734'>Demetrius</prn>, was ravaging their country, which he had invaded with an army, and at the same time was blockading them by sea with a fleet. </p>
<p id='1.1.2'><b>1.1.2</b> The <pl id='Q13426467'>Peiraeus</pl> was a deme from early times, though it was not a port before <prn id='Q179552'>Themistocles</prn> became an archon of the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>. Their port was <pl id='Q534927'>Phalerum</pl>, for at this place the sea comes nearest to <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, and from here men say that <prn id='Q781867'>Menestheus</prn> set sail with his fleet for <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl>, and before him <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>, when he went to give satisfaction to <prn id='Q23168'>Minos</prn> for the death of <prn id='Q512388'>Androgeos</prn>. But when <prn id='Q179552'>Themistocles</prn> became archon [493 BCE], since he thought that the <pl id='Q13426467'>Peiraeus</pl> was more conveniently situated for mariners, and had three harbors as against one at <pl id='Q534927'>Phalerum</pl>, he made it the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> port. Even up to my time there were <pl id='Q1133291'>shipsheds</pl> there, and near the largest <pl id='Q29626000'>harbor</pl> is the grave of <prn id='Q179552'>Themistocles</prn>. For it is said that the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> repented of their treatment of <prn id='Q179552'>Themistocles</prn>, and that his relations took up his bones and brought them from <pl id='Q1432674'>Magnesia</pl>. And the children of <prn id='Q179552'>Themistocles</prn> certainly returned and set up in the <pl id='Q10288'>Parthenon</pl> a painting, on which is a portrait of <prn id='Q179552'>Themistocles</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.1.3'><b>1.1.3</b> The most noteworthy sight in the <pl id='Q13426467'>Peiraeus</pl> is a precinct of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> and <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>. Both their images are of bronze; <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> holds a staff and a <prn id='Q165023'>Victory</prn>, <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> a spear. Here is a portrait of <prn id='Q183109'>Leosthenes</prn> and of his sons, painted by <prn id='Q21866989'>Arcesilaus</prn>. This <prn id='Q183109'>Leosthenes</prn> at the head of the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> and the united Greeks defeated the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> in <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl> and again outside <pl id='Q194450'>Thermopylae</pl> forced them into <pl id='Q192980'>Lamia</pl> over against <pl id='Q132378'>Oeta</pl>, and shut them up there. The portrait is in the <pl id='Q97355669'>Long Stoa</pl>, where stands an agora for those living near the sea — those farther away from the harbor have another — but behind the stoa near the sea stand a <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> and a <prn id='Q4157689'>Demos</prn>, the work of <prn id='Q323430'>Leochares</prn>. And by the sea <prn id='Q363832'>Conon</prn> built a sanctuary of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>, after he had crushed the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> triremes off <pl id='Q690575'>Cnidus</pl> in the <pl id='Q193214'>Carian</pl> peninsula. For the <pl id='Q690575'>Cnidians</pl> hold <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> in very great honor, and they have sanctuaries of the goddess; the oldest is to her as <prn id='Q60183934'>Doritis</prn> (Bountiful), the next in age as <prn id='Q420733'>Acraea</prn> (Of the Height/Promontory), while the newest is to the <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> called <pl id='Q690575'>Cnidian</pl> by men generally, but <prn id='Q60958067'>Euploia</prn> (Fair Voyage) by the <pl id='Q690575'>Cnidians</pl> themselves. </p>
<p id='1.1.4'><b>1.1.4</b> The <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> have also another harbor, at <pl id='Q1611219'>Munychia</pl>, with a temple of <prn id='Q107351283'>Munychian</prn> <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, and yet another at <pl id='Q534927'>Phalerum</pl>, as I have already stated, and near it is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>. Here there is also a temple of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> <prn id='Q107326431'>Sciras</prn>, and one of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> some distance away, and altars of the gods named <prn id='Q114315369'>Unknown</prn>, and of heroes, and of the children of <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> and <prn id='Q638008'>Phalerus</prn>; for this <prn id='Q638008'>Phalerus</prn> is said by the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> to have sailed with <prn id='Q176758'>Jason</prn> to <pl id='Q183150'>Colchis</pl>. There is also an altar of <prn id='Q512388'>Androgeos</prn>, son of <prn id='Q23168'>Minos</prn>, though it is called that of Heros; those, however, who pay special attention to the study of their country's antiquities know that it belongs to <prn id='Q512388'>Androgeos</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.1.5'><b>1.1.5</b> Twenty stades away is the <pl id='Q25106019'>Colias promontory</pl>; onto it, when the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl> fleet was destroyed, the wrecks were carried down by the waves. There is here an image of the <prn id='Q107349737'>Coliad</prn> <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>, with the goddesses <prn id='Q61679150'>Genetyllides</prn> (Goddesses of Birth), as they are called. And I am of opinion that the goddesses of the <pl id='Q428732'>Phocaeans</pl> in <pl id='Q620874'>Ionia</pl>, whom they call Gennaides, are the same as those at <pl id='Q25106019'>Colias</pl>. On the way from <pl id='Q534927'>Phalerum</pl> to <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> there is a temple of <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> with neither doors nor roof. Men say that <prn id='Q155063'>Mardonius</prn>, son of <prn id='Q454695'>Gobryas</prn>, burnt it. But the image there today is, as report goes, the work of <prn id='Q505640'>Alcamenes</prn>. So that this, at any rate, cannot have been damaged by the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl>. </p>
<p id='1.2.1'><b>1.2.1</b> On entering the city there is a monument to <prn id='Q580862'>Antiope</prn> the <prn id='Q134154'>Amazon</prn>. This <prn id='Q580862'>Antiope</prn>, <prn id='Q134929'>Pindar</prn> says, was carried off by <prn id='Q502156'>Peirithous</prn> and <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>, but <prn id='Q2283002'>Hegias</prn> of <pl id='Q581494'>Troezen</pl> gives the following account of her. <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> was besieging <pl id='Q122875'>Themiscyra</pl> on the <pl id='Q684421'>Thermodon</pl>, but could not take it, but <prn id='Q580862'>Antiope</prn>, falling in love with <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>, who was aiding <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> in his campaign, surrendered the stronghold. Such is the account of <prn id='Q2283002'>Hegias</prn>. But the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> assert that when the <prn id='Q134154'>Amazons</prn> came, <prn id='Q580862'>Antiope</prn> was shot by <prn id='Q2608554'>Molpadia</prn>, while <prn id='Q2608554'>Molpadia</prn> was killed by <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>. To <prn id='Q2608554'>Molpadia</prn> also there is a monument among the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>. </p>
<p id='1.2.2'><b>1.2.2</b> As you go up from the <pl id='Q13426467'>Peiraeus</pl> you see the ruins of the <pl id='Q1163616'>walls</pl> which <prn id='Q363832'>Conon</prn> restored after the naval battle off <pl id='Q690575'>Cnidus</pl>. For those built by <prn id='Q179552'>Themistocles</prn> after the retreat of the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl> were destroyed during the rule of those named the <prn id='Q643488'>Thirty</prn>. Along the road are very famous graves, that of <prn id='Q118992'>Menander</prn>, son of <prn id='Q3781404'>Diopeithes</prn>, and a cenotaph of <prn id='Q48305'>Euripides</prn>. He himself went to King <prn id='Q26846'>Archelaus</prn> and lies buried in <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl>; as to the manner of his death (many have described it), let it be as they say. </p>
<p id='1.2.3'><b>1.2.3</b> So even in his time poets lived at the courts of kings, as earlier still <prn id='Q213484'>Anacreon</prn> consorted with <prn id='Q294840'>Polycrates</prn>, despot of <pl id='Q13580795'>Samos</pl>, and <prn id='Q40939'>Aeschylus</prn> and <prn id='Q273003'>Simonides</prn> journeyed to <prn id='Q335634'>Hiero</prn> at <pl id='Q4420718'>Syracuse</pl>. <prn id='Q332750'>Dionysius</prn>, afterwards despot in <pl id='Q4951156'>Sicily</pl> had <prn id='Q138664'>Philoxenus</prn> at his court, and <prn id='Q241386'>Antigonus</prn>, ruler of <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl>, had <prn id='Q3558582'>Antagoras</prn> of <pl id='Q13533316'>Rhodes</pl> and <prn id='Q180671'>Aratus</prn> of <pl id='Q656954'>Soli</pl>. But <prn id='Q44233'>Hesiod</prn> and <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> either failed to win the society of kings or else purposely despised it, <prn id='Q44233'>Hesiod</prn> through boorishness and reluctance to travel, while <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>, having gone very far abroad, depreciated the help afforded by despots in the acquisition of wealth in comparison with his reputation among ordinary men. And yet <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>, too, in his poem makes <prn id='Q844808'>Demodocus</prn> live at the court of <prn id='Q496595'>Alcinous</prn>, and <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn> leave a poet with his wife. Not far from the gates is a grave, on which is mounted a soldier standing by a <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn>. Who it is I do not know, but both horse and soldier were carved by <prn id='Q105290'>Praxiteles</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.2.4'><b>1.2.4</b> On entering the city there is a <pl id='Q2372311'>building</pl> for the preparation of the processions, which are held in some cases every year, in others at longer intervals. Hard by is a temple of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>, with images of the goddess herself and of her daughter, and of <prn id='Q690603'>Iacchus</prn> holding a torch. On the wall, in <pl id='Q122443'>Attic</pl> characters, is written that they are works of <prn id='Q105290'>Praxiteles</prn>. Not far from the temple is <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> on horseback, hurling a spear against the giant <prn id='Q1233841'>Polybotes</prn>, concerning whom is prevalent among the <pl id='Q187027'>Coans</pl> the story about the promontory of Chelone. But the inscription of our time assigns the statue to another, and not to <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>. From the gate to the <pl id='Q630974'>Cerameicus</pl> there are stoas, and in front of them bronze statues of such as had some title to fame, both men and women. </p>
<p id='1.2.5'><b>1.2.5</b> One of the stoas contains shrines of gods, and a gymnasium called that of <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn>. In it is the house of <prn id='Q107351517'>Poulytion</prn>, at which it is said that a mystic rite was performed by the most notable <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, parodying the <prn id='Q26314'>Eleusinian mysteries</prn>. But in my time it was devoted to the worship of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>. This <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> they call <prn id='Q107349740'>Melpomenus</prn> (Minstrel), on the same principle as they call <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> <prn id='Q12130844'>Musegetes</prn> (Leader of the <prn id='Q66016'>Muses</prn>). Here there are images of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> <prn id='Q107349741'>Paeonia</prn> (Healer), of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, of <prn id='Q102884'>Mnemosyne</prn> (Memory) and of the <prn id='Q66016'>Muses</prn>, an <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, the votive offering and work of <prn id='Q992267'>Eubulides</prn>, and <prn id='Q12647288'>Acratus</prn>, a daemon attendant upon <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysos</prn>; it is only a face of him worked into the wall. After the precinct of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysos</prn> is a building that contains clay images, <prn id='Q474854'>Amphictyon</prn>, king of <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, feasting <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> and other gods. Here also is <prn id='Q107389980'>Pegasus</prn> of <pl id='Q1328318'>Eleutherae</pl>, who introduced the god to the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>. Herein he was helped by the oracle at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>, which called to mind that the god once dwelt in <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> in the days of <prn id='Q608800'>Icarius</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.2.6'><b>1.2.6</b> <prn id='Q474854'>Amphictyon</prn> won the kingdom thus. It is said that <prn id='Q421808'>Actaeus</prn> was the first king of what is now <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl>. When he died, <prn id='Q500739'>Cecrops</prn>, the son-in-law of <prn id='Q421808'>Actaeus</prn>, received the kingdom, and there were born to him daughters, <prn id='Q16641710'>Herse</prn>, <prn id='Q584492'>Aglaurus</prn> and <prn id='Q633120'>Pandrosus</prn>, and a son <prn id='Q491615'>Erysichthon</prn>. This son did not become king of the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, but happened to die while his father lived, and the kingdom of <prn id='Q500739'>Cecrops</prn> fell to <prn id='Q928411'>Cranaus</prn>, the most powerful of the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>. They say that <prn id='Q928411'>Cranaus</prn> had daughters, and among them <prn id='Q495133'>Atthis</prn>; and from her they call the country <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl>, which before was named <prn id='Q12898582'>Actaea</prn>. And <prn id='Q474854'>Amphictyon</prn>, rising up against <prn id='Q928411'>Cranaus</prn>, although he had his daughter to wife, deposed him from power. Afterwards he himself was banished by <prn id='Q644921'>Erichthonius</prn> and his fellow rebels. Men say that <prn id='Q644921'>Erichthonius</prn> had no human father, but that his parents were <prn id='Q44384'>Hephaestus</prn> and <prn id='Q93172'>Earth</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.3.1'><b>1.3.1</b> The district of the <pl id='Q630974'>Cerameicus</pl> has its name from the hero <prn id='Q3664982'>Ceramus</prn>, he too being the reputed son of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> and <prn id='Q184874'>Ariadne</prn>. First on the right is what is called the <pl id='Q1670679'>Royal Stoa</pl>, where sits the <prn id='Q636163'>king</prn> when holding the yearly office called the kingship. On the tiling of this stoa are images of baked earthenware, <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> throwing <prn id='Q1469237'>Sciron</prn> into the sea and <prn id='Q192107'>Hemera</prn> (day) carrying away <prn id='Q3010239'>Cephalus</prn>, who they say was very beautiful and was ravished by <prn id='Q192107'>Hemera</prn>, who was in love with him. His son was <prn id='Q203480'>Phaethon</prn>, . . . and [Aphrodite] made a guardian of her temple. Such is the tale told by <prn id='Q44233'>Hesiod</prn>, among others, in his poem on women. </p>
<p id='1.3.2'><b>1.3.2</b> Near the stoa stand <prn id='Q363832'>Conon</prn>, <prn id='Q713679'>Timotheus</prn> his son and <prn id='Q463301'>Evagoras</prn> King of <pl id='Q644636'>Cyprus</pl>, who caused the <pl id='Q41642'>Phoenician</pl> men-of-war to be given to <prn id='Q363832'>Conon</prn> by King <prn id='Q189689'>Artaxerxes</prn>. This he did as an <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> whose ancestry connected him with <pl id='Q202422'>Salamis</pl>, for he traced his pedigree back to <prn id='Q878184'>Teucer</prn> and the daughter of <prn id='Q878246'>Cinyras</prn>. Here stands <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, called <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q106542644'>Eleutherios</prn> (of Freedom ), and the Emperor Hadrian, a benefactor to all his subjects and especially to the city of the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>. </p>
<p id='1.3.3'><b>1.3.3</b> A <pl id='Q331355'>stoa</pl> is built behind with pictures of the gods called the <prn id='Q101609'>Twelve</prn>. On the wall opposite are painted <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>, <prn id='Q109829489'>Democracy</prn> and <prn id='Q4157689'>Demos</prn>. The picture represents <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> as the one who gave the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> political equality. By other means also has the report spread among men that <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> bestowed sovereignty upon the people, and that from his time they continued under a democratical government, until <prn id='Q242172'>Peisistratus</prn> rose up and became despot. But there are many false beliefs current among the mass of mankind, since they are ignorant of historical science and consider trustworthy whatever they have heard from childhood in choruses and tragedies; one of these is about <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>, who in fact himself became king, and afterwards, when <prn id='Q781867'>Menestheus</prn> was dead, the Theseidae remained rulers even to the fourth generation. But if I cared about tracing the pedigree I should have included in the list, besides these, the kings from <prn id='Q1255043'>Melanthus</prn> to <prn id='Q90980430'>Cleidicus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q90974187'>Aesimides</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.3.4'><b>1.3.4</b> Here is a picture of the exploit, near <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantinea</pl>, of the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> who were sent to help the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. <prn id='Q129772'>Xenophon</prn> among others has written a history of the whole war — the taking of the <pl id='Q11225429'>Cadmea</pl>, the defeat of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> at <pl id='Q2606004'>Leuctra</pl>, how the <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotians</pl> invaded the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl>, and the contingent sent to the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> from the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>. In the picture is a cavalry battle, in which the most famous men are, among the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, <prn id='Q10291570'>Grylus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q129772'>Xenophon</prn>, and in the <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotian</pl> cavalry, <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn> the <pl id='Q11225429'>Theban</pl>. These pictures were painted for the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> by <prn id='Q949770'>Euphranor</prn>, and he also wrought the <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> surnamed <pl id='Q3142437'>Patroos</pl> (Ancestral) in the temple hard by. And in front of the temple is one <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> made by <prn id='Q323430'>Leochares</prn>; the other <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, called <prn id='Q4721374'>Alexikakos</prn> (Averter of evil), was made by <prn id='Q918382'>Calamis</prn>. They say that the god received this name because by an oracle from <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> he stayed the pestilence which afflicted the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> at the time of the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesian</pl> War. </p>
<p id='1.3.5'><b>1.3.5</b> Here is built also a <pl id='Q1925757'>sanctuary</pl> of the <prn id='Q334486'>Mother</prn> of the Gods; the image is by <prn id='Q177302'>Pheidias</prn>. Hard by is the <pl id='Q38278350'>Bouleuterion</pl> of those called the Five Hundred, who are the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> councillors for a year. In it are a <prn id='Q693222'>xoanon</prn> of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q8069815'>Boulaios</prn> (Counsellor) and an <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, the work of <prn id='Q20795306'>Peisias</prn>, and a <prn id='Q4157689'>Demos</prn> by <prn id='Q29159289'>Lyson</prn>. The thesmothetae (lawgivers) were painted by <prn id='Q930914'>Protogenes</prn> the <pl id='Q608095'>Caunian</pl>, and <prn id='Q11939298'>Olbiades</prn> portrayed <prn id='Q11910956'>Callippus</prn>, who led the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> to <pl id='Q194450'>Thermopylae</pl> to stop the incursion of the Gauls into Greece. </p>
<p id='1.4.1'><b>1.4.1</b> These Gauls inhabit the most remote portion of Europe, near a great sea that is not navigable to its extremities, and possesses ebb and flow and creatures quite unlike those of other seas. Through their country flows the river <pl id='Q643'>Eridanos</pl>, on the bank of which the daughters of <prn id='Q134270'>Helius</prn> (Sun) are supposed to lament the fate that befell their brother <prn id='Q203480'>Phaethon</prn>. It was late before the name “Gauls” came into vogue; for anciently they were called <pl id='Q35966'>Celts</pl> both amongst themselves and by others. An army of them mustered and turned towards the <pl id='Q37495'>Ionian Sea</pl>, dispossessed the <pl id='Q32047'>Illyrian</pl> people, all who dwelt as far as <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl> with the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> themselves, and overran <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessaly</pl>. And when they drew near to <pl id='Q194450'>Thermopylae</pl>, the Greeks in general made no move to prevent the inroad of the barbarians, since previously they had been severely defeated by <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn> and <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn>. Further, <prn id='Q204760'>Antipater</prn> and <prn id='Q207183'>Cassander</prn> afterwards crushed the Greeks, so that through weakness each state thought no shame of itself taking no part in the defence of the country. </p>
<p id='1.4.2'><b>1.4.2</b> But the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, although they were more exhausted than any of the Greeks by the long <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonian</pl> war, and had been generally unsuccessful in their battles, nevertheless set forth to <pl id='Q194450'>Thermopylae</pl> with such Greeks as joined them, having made the <prn id='Q11910956'>Callippus</prn> I mentioned their general. Occupying the pass where it was narrowest, they tried to keep the foreigners from entering Greece; but the <pl id='Q35966'>Celts</pl>, having discovered the path by which <prn id='Q374923'>Ephialtes</prn> of Trachis once led the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl>, overwhelmed the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> stationed there and crossed <pl id='Q132378'>Oeta</pl> unperceived by the Greeks. </p>
<p id='1.4.3'><b>1.4.3</b> Then it was that the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> put the Greeks under the greatest obligation, and although outflanked offered resistance to the foreigners on two sides. But the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> on the fleet suffered most, for the <pl id='Q192980'>Lamian</pl> gulf is a swamp near <pl id='Q194450'>Thermopylae</pl> — the reason being, I think, the hot water that here runs into the sea. These then were more distressed; for taking the Greeks on board they were forced to sail through the mud weighted as they were by arms and men. </p>
<p id='1.4.4'><b>1.4.4</b> So they tried to save Greece in the way described, but the Gauls, now south of the <pl id='Q194450'>Gates</pl>, cared not at all to capture the other towns, but were very eager to sack <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> and the treasures of the god. They were opposed by the <pl id='Q75459'>Delphians</pl> themselves and the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> of the cities around <pl id='Q105261'>Parnassus</pl>; a force of <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolians</pl> also joined the defenders, for the <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolians</pl> at this time were pre-eminent for their vigorous activity. When the forces engaged, not only were thunderbolts and rocks broken off from <pl id='Q105261'>Parnassus</pl> hurled against the Gauls, but terrible shapes as armed warriors haunted the foreigners. They say that two of them, <prn id='Q91121099'>Hyperochus</prn> and <prn id='Q62088620'>Amadocus</prn>, came from the <prn id='Q12871715'>Hyperboreans</prn>, and that the third was <prn id='Q322639'>Pyrrhus</prn> son of <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn>. Because of this help in battle the <pl id='Q75459'>Delphians</pl> sacrifice to <prn id='Q322639'>Pyrrhus</prn> as to a hero, although formerly they held even his tomb in dishonor, as being that of an enemy. </p>
<p id='1.4.5'><b>1.4.5</b> The greater number of the Gauls crossed over to <prn id='Q48'>Asia</prn> by ship and plundered its coasts. Some time after, the inhabitants of <pl id='Q18986'>Pergamus</pl>, that was called of old <pl id='Q11951693'>Teuthrania</pl>, drove the Gauls into it from the sea. Now this people occupied the country on the farther side of the river <pl id='Q217466'>Sangarius</pl> capturing <pl id='Q107585355'>Ancyra</pl>, a city of the <pl id='Q32579'>Phrygians</pl>, which <prn id='Q308398'>Midas</prn> son of <prn id='Q1413020'>Gordius</prn> had founded in former time. And the anchor, which <prn id='Q308398'>Midas</prn> found, was even as late as my time in the sanctuary of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, as well as a spring called the Spring of <prn id='Q308398'>Midas</prn>, water from which they say <prn id='Q308398'>Midas</prn> mixed with wine to capture <prn id='Q464091'>Silenus</prn>. Well then, the <pl id='Q18986'>Pergameni</pl> took <pl id='Q107585355'>Ancyra</pl> and <pl id='Q728353'>Pessinus</pl> which lies under Mount <place id='393318Agd'>Agdistis</place>, where they say that <prn id='Q262016'>Attis</prn> lies buried. </p>
<p id='1.4.6'><b>1.4.6</b> They have spoils from the Gauls, and a painting which portrays their deed against them. The land they dwell in was, they say, in ancient times sacred to the <prn id='Q940138'>Cabeiri</prn>, and they claim that they are themselves <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl>, being of those who crossed into <prn id='Q48'>Asia</prn> with <prn id='Q916442'>Telephus</prn>. Of the wars that they have waged no account has been published to the world, except that they have accomplished three most notable achievements; the subjection of the coast region of <prn id='Q48'>Asia</prn>, the expulsion of the Gauls therefrom, and the exploit of <prn id='Q916442'>Telephus</prn> against the followers of <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn>, at a time when the Greeks after missing <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl>, were plundering the Meian plain thinking it <pl id='Q22647'>Trojan</pl> territory. Now I will return from my digression. </p>
<p id='1.5.1'><b>1.5.1</b> Near to the <pl id='Q38278350'>Bouleuterion</pl> of the Five Hundred is what is called <pl id='Q9087412'>Tholos</pl> (Round House); here the presidents sacrifice, and there are a few small statues made of silver. Farther up stand <pl id='Q2094507'>statues of heroes</pl>, from whom afterwards the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> tribes received their names. Who the man was who established ten tribes instead of four, and changed their old names to new ones — all this is told by <prn id='Q26825'>Herodotus</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.5.2'><b>1.5.2</b> The <pl id='Q2094507'>Eponymoi</pl> — this is the name given to them — are <prn id='Q1304531'>Hippothoon</prn> son of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> and <prn id='Q657562'>Alope</prn> daughter of <prn id='Q1349772'>Cercyon</prn>, <prn id='Q4067044'>Antiochus</prn>, one of the children of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> borne to him by <prn id='Q44420027'>Meda</prn> daughter of <prn id='Q3744924'>Phylas</prn>, thirdly, <prn id='Q172725'>Ajax</prn> son of <prn id='Q331327'>Telamon</prn>, and to the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> belongs <prn id='Q4258941'>Leos</prn>, who is said to have given up his daughters, at the command of the oracle, for the safety of the commonwealth. Among the Eponymoi is <prn id='Q301219'>Erechtheus</prn>, who conquered the <pl id='Q11918833'>Eleusinians</pl> in battle, and killed their general, <prn id='Q4200286'>Immaradus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q1125049'>Eumolpus</prn>. There is <prn id='Q191725'>Aegeus</prn> also and <prn id='Q123190295'>Oeneus</prn> the bastard son of <prn id='Q1076578'>Pandion</prn>, and <prn id='Q348668'>Acamas</prn>, one of the children of <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.5.3'><b>1.5.3</b> I saw also among the eponymoi, statues of <prn id='Q500739'>Cecrops</prn> and <prn id='Q16931911'>Pandion</prn>, but I do not know who of those names are thus honored. For there was an earlier ruler <prn id='Q500739'>Cecrops</prn> who took to wife the daughter of <prn id='Q421808'>Actaeus</prn>, and a later — he it was who migrated to <pl id='Q173096'>Euboea</pl> — son of <prn id='Q301219'>Erechtheus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q865111'>Pandion</prn>, son of <prn id='Q644921'>Erichthonius</prn>. And there was a king <prn id='Q865111'>Pandion</prn> who was son of <prn id='Q644921'>Erichthonius</prn>, and another who was son of <prn id='Q974346'>Cecrops</prn> the second. This man was deposed from his kingdom by the <prn id='Q33195778'>Metionidae</prn>, and when he fled to <pl id='Q42307600'>Megara</pl> — for he had to wife the daughter of <prn id='Q3411223'>Pylas</prn> king of <pl id='Q42307600'>Megara</pl> — his children were banished with him. And <prn id='Q1076578'>Pandion</prn> is said to have fallen ill there and died, and on the coast of the <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarid</pl> is his tomb, on the rock called the Skopelos of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> <prn id='Q21548073'>Aithyia</prn> (the Gannet). </p>
<p id='1.5.4'><b>1.5.4</b> But his children expelled the <prn id='Q33195778'>Metionidae</prn>, and returned from banishment at <pl id='Q42307600'>Megara</pl>, and <prn id='Q191725'>Aegeus</prn>, as the eldest, became king of the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>. But in rearing daughters <prn id='Q865111'>Pandion</prn> was unlucky, nor did they leave any sons to avenge him. And yet it was for the sake of power that he made the marriage alliance with the king of <pl id='Q41741'>Thrace</pl>. But there is no way for a mortal to overstep what the deity thinks fit to send. They say that <prn id='Q1138506'>Tereus</prn>, though wedded to <prn id='Q1231743'>Procne</prn>, dishonored <prn id='Q115449'>Philomela</prn>, thereby transgressing Greek custom, and further, having mangled the body of the damsel, constrained the women to avenge her. There is another statue, well worth seeing, of <prn id='Q865111'>Pandion</prn> on the <pl id='Q131013'>Acropolis</pl>. </p>
<p id='1.5.5'><b>1.5.5</b> These are the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> eponymoi who belong to the ancients. And of later date than these they have tribes named after the following, <prn id='Q110745'>Attalus</prn> the <pl id='Q622319'>Mysian</pl> and <prn id='Q39576'>Ptolemy</prn> the <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptian</pl>, and within my own time the emperor <prn id='Q1427'>Hadrian</prn>, who was extremely religious in the respect he paid to the deity and contributed very much to the happiness of his various subjects. He never voluntarily entered upon a war, but he reduced the <prn id='Q7325'>Hebrews</prn> beyond <pl id='Q13415123'>Syria</pl>, who had rebelled. As for the sanctuaries of the gods that in some cases he built from the beginning, in others adorned with offerings and furniture, and the bounties he gave to Greek cities, and sometimes even to foreigners who asked him, all these acts are inscribed in his honor in the sanctuary at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> common to all the gods. </p>
<p id='1.6.1'><b>1.6.1</b> But as to the history of <prn id='Q110745'>Attalus</prn> and <prn id='Q168261'>Ptolemy</prn>, it is more ancient in point of time, so that tradition no longer remains, and those who lived with these kings for the purpose of chronicling their deeds fell into neglect even before tradition failed. Wherefore it occurred to me to narrate their deeds also, and how the sovereignty of <pl id='Q11768'>Egypt</pl>, of the <pl id='Q622319'>Mysians</pl> and of the neighboring peoples fell into the hands of their fathers. </p>
<p id='1.6.2'><b>1.6.2</b> 27 The <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> consider <prn id='Q168261'>Ptolemy</prn> to be the son of <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q313907'>Amyntas</prn>, though putatively the son of <prn id='Q718154'>Lagus</prn>, asserting that his mother was with child by <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn> when she was married to <prn id='Q718154'>Lagus</prn>. And among the distinguished acts of <prn id='Q168261'>Ptolemy</prn> in <prn id='Q48'>Asia</prn> they mention that it was he who, of <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn>'s companions, was foremost in succoring him when in danger among the <prn id='Q25377606'>Oxydracae</prn>. After the death of <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn>, by withstanding those who would have conferred all his empire upon <prn id='Q295530'>Aridaeus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn>, he became chiefly responsible for the division of the various nations into the kingdoms. </p>
<p id='1.6.3'><b>1.6.3</b> He crossed over to <pl id='Q11768'>Egypt</pl> in person, and killed <prn id='Q721609'>Cleomenes</prn>, whom <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn> had appointed satrap of that country, considering him a friend of <prn id='Q202113'>Perdiccas</prn>, and therefore not faithful to himself; and the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> who had been entrusted with the task of carrying the corpse of <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn> to <pl id='Q16963755'>Aegae</pl>, he persuaded to hand it over to him. And he proceeded to bury it with <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonian</pl> rites in <pl id='Q5715'>Memphis</pl>, but, knowing that <prn id='Q202113'>Perdiccas</prn> would make war, he kept <pl id='Q11768'>Egypt</pl> garrisoned. And <prn id='Q202113'>Perdiccas</prn> took <prn id='Q295530'>Aridaeus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn>, and the boy <prn id='Q207847'>Alexander</prn>, whom <prn id='Q190055'>Roxana</prn>, daughter of <prn id='Q551847'>Oxyartes</prn>, had borne to <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn>, to lend color to the campaign, but really he was plotting to take from <prn id='Q168261'>Ptolemy</prn> his kingdom in <pl id='Q11768'>Egypt</pl>. But being expelled from <pl id='Q11768'>Egypt</pl>, and having lost his reputation as a soldier, and being in other respects unpopular with the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl>, he was put to death by his body guard. </p>
<p id='1.6.4'><b>1.6.4</b> The death of <prn id='Q202113'>Perdiccas</prn> immediately raised <prn id='Q168261'>Ptolemy</prn> to power, who both reduced the Syrians and <pl id='Q41642'>Phoenicia</pl>, and also welcomed <prn id='Q184176'>Seleucus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q579596'>Antiochus</prn>, who was in exile, having been expelled by <prn id='Q200401'>Antigonus</prn>; he further himself prepared to attack <prn id='Q200401'>Antigonus</prn>. He prevailed on <prn id='Q207183'>Cassander</prn>, son of <prn id='Q204760'>Antipater</prn>, and <prn id='Q32133'>Lysimachus</prn>, who was king in <pl id='Q41741'>Thrace</pl>, to join in the war, urging that <prn id='Q184176'>Seleucus</prn> was in exile and that the growth of the power of <prn id='Q200401'>Antigonus</prn> was dangerous to them all. </p>
<p id='1.6.5'><b>1.6.5</b> For a time <prn id='Q200401'>Antigonus</prn> prepared for war, and was by no means confident of the issue; but on learning that the revolt of <pl id='Q44112'>Cyrene</pl> had called <prn id='Q168261'>Ptolemy</prn> to <pl id='Q2370577'>Libya</pl>, he immediately reduced the Syrians and <pl id='Q41642'>Phoenicians</pl> by a sudden inroad, handed them over to <prn id='Q59734'>Demetrius</prn>, his son, a man who for all his youth had already a reputation for good sense, and went down to the <pl id='Q6514'>Hellespont</pl>. But he led his army back without crossing, on hearing that <prn id='Q59734'>Demetrius</prn> had been overcome by <prn id='Q168261'>Ptolemy</prn> in battle. But <prn id='Q59734'>Demetrius</prn> had not altogether evacuated the country before <prn id='Q168261'>Ptolemy</prn>, and having surprised a body of <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptians</pl>, killed a few of them. Then on the arrival of <prn id='Q200401'>Antigonus</prn> <prn id='Q168261'>Ptolemy</prn> did not wait for him but returned to <pl id='Q11768'>Egypt</pl>. </p>
<p id='1.6.6'><b>1.6.6</b> When the winter was over, <prn id='Q59734'>Demetrius</prn> sailed to <pl id='Q644636'>Cyprus</pl> and overcame in a naval action <prn id='Q171839'>Menelaus</prn>, the satrap of <prn id='Q168261'>Ptolemy</prn>, and afterwards <prn id='Q168261'>Ptolemy</prn> himself, who had crossed to bring help. <prn id='Q168261'>Ptolemy</prn> fled to <pl id='Q11768'>Egypt</pl>, where he was besieged by <prn id='Q200401'>Antigonus</prn> on land and by <prn id='Q59734'>Demetrius</prn> with a fleet. In spite of his extreme peril <prn id='Q168261'>Ptolemy</prn> saved his empire by making a stand with an army at <pl id='Q1145715'>Pelusium</pl> while offering resistance with warships from the river. <prn id='Q200401'>Antigonus</prn> now abandoned all hope of reducing <pl id='Q11768'>Egypt</pl> in the circumstances, and dispatched <prn id='Q59734'>Demetrius</prn> against the <pl id='Q13533316'>Rhodians</pl> with a fleet and a large army, hoping, if the island were won, to use it as a base against the <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptians</pl>. But the <pl id='Q13533316'>Rhodians</pl> displayed daring and ingenuity in the face of the besiegers, while <prn id='Q168261'>Ptolemy</prn> helped them with all the forces he could muster. </p>
<p id='1.6.7'><b>1.6.7</b> <prn id='Q200401'>Antigonus</prn> thus failed to reduce <pl id='Q11768'>Egypt</pl> or, later, <pl id='Q13533316'>Rhodes</pl>, and shortly afterwards he offered battle to <prn id='Q32133'>Lysimachus</prn>, and to <prn id='Q207183'>Cassander</prn> and the army of <prn id='Q184176'>Seleucus</prn>, lost most of his forces, and was himself killed, having suffered most by reason of the length of the war with <prn id='Q297366'>Eumenes</prn>. Of the kings who put down <prn id='Q200401'>Antigonus</prn> I hold that the most wicked was <prn id='Q207183'>Cassander</prn>, who although he had recovered the throne of <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl> with the aid of <prn id='Q200401'>Antigonus</prn>, nevertheless came to fight against a benefactor. </p>
<p id='1.6.8'><b>1.6.8</b> After the death of <prn id='Q200401'>Antigonus</prn>, <prn id='Q168261'>Ptolemy</prn> again reduced the Syrians and <pl id='Q644636'>Cyprus</pl>, and also restored <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn> to <pl id='Q2551754'>Thesprotia</pl> on the mainland. <pl id='Q44112'>Cyrene</pl> rebelled; but <prn id='Q3233494'>Magas</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q40010'>Berenice</prn> (who was at this time married to <prn id='Q168261'>Ptolemy</prn>) captured <pl id='Q44112'>Cyrene</pl> in the fifth year of the rebellion. If this <prn id='Q168261'>Ptolemy</prn> really was the son of <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn>, son of <prn id='Q313907'>Amyntas</prn>, he must have inherited from his father his passion for women, for, while wedded to <prn id='Q233771'>Eurydice</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q204760'>Antipater</prn>, although he had children he took a fancy to <prn id='Q40010'>Berenice</prn>, whom <prn id='Q204760'>Antipater</prn> had sent to <pl id='Q11768'>Egypt</pl> with <prn id='Q233771'>Eurydice</prn>. He fell in love with this woman and had children by her, and when his end drew near he left the kingdom of <pl id='Q11768'>Egypt</pl> to <prn id='Q39576'>Ptolemy</prn> (from whom the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> name their tribe) being the son of <prn id='Q40010'>Berenice</prn> and not of the daughter of <prn id='Q204760'>Antipater</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.7.1'><b>1.7.1</b> This <prn id='Q39576'>Ptolemy</prn> fell in love with <prn id='Q40234'>Arsinoe</prn>, his full sister, and married her, violating herein <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonian</pl> custom, but following that of his <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptian</pl> subjects. Secondly he put to death his brother <prn id='Q252091'>Argaeus</prn>, who was, it is said, plotting against him; and he it was who brought down from <pl id='Q5715'>Memphis</pl> the corpse of <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn>. He put to death another brother also, son of <prn id='Q233771'>Eurydice</prn>, on discovering that he was creating disaffection among the <pl id='Q644636'>Cyprians</pl>. Then <prn id='Q3233494'>Magas</prn>, the half-brother of <prn id='Q39576'>Ptolemy</prn>, who had been entrusted with the governorship of <pl id='Q44112'>Cyrene</pl> by his mother <prn id='Q40010'>Berenice</prn> — she had borne him to Philip, a <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonian</pl> but of no note and of lowly origin — induced the people of <pl id='Q44112'>Cyrene</pl> to revolt from <prn id='Q39576'>Ptolemy</prn> and marched against <pl id='Q11768'>Egypt</pl>. </p>
<p id='1.7.2'><b>1.7.2</b> <prn id='Q39576'>Ptolemy</prn> fortified the entrance into <pl id='Q11768'>Egypt</pl> and awaited the attack of the <pl id='Q44112'>Cyrenians</pl>. But while on the march <prn id='Q3233494'>Magas</prn> was in formed that the <prn id='Q3849712'>Marmaridae</prn>, a tribe of Libyan nomads, had revolted, and thereupon fell back upon <pl id='Q44112'>Cyrene</pl>. <prn id='Q39576'>Ptolemy</prn> resolved to pursue, but was checked owing to the following circumstance. When he was preparing to meet the attack of <prn id='Q3233494'>Magas</prn>, he engaged mercenaries, including some four thousand Gauls. Discovering that they were plotting to seize <pl id='Q11768'>Egypt</pl>, he led them through the river to a deserted island. There they perished at one another's hands or by famine. </p>
<p id='1.7.3'><b>1.7.3</b> <prn id='Q3233494'>Magas</prn>, who was married to <prn id='Q451066'>Apame</prn>, daughter of <prn id='Q211488'>Antiochus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q184176'>Seleucus</prn>, persuaded <prn id='Q211488'>Antiochus</prn> to break the treaty which his father <prn id='Q184176'>Seleucus</prn> had made with <prn id='Q39576'>Ptolemy</prn> and to attack <pl id='Q11768'>Egypt</pl>. When <prn id='Q211488'>Antiochus</prn> resolved to attack, <prn id='Q39576'>Ptolemy</prn> dispatched forces against all the subjects of <prn id='Q211488'>Antiochus</prn>, freebooters to overrun the lands of the weaker, and an army to hold back the stronger, so that <prn id='Q211488'>Antiochus</prn> never had an opportunity of attacking <pl id='Q11768'>Egypt</pl>. I have already stated how this <prn id='Q39576'>Ptolemy</prn> sent a fleet to help the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> against <prn id='Q200401'>Antigonus</prn> and the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl>, but it did very little to save <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>. His children were by <prn id='Q231668'>Arsinoe</prn>, not his sister, but the daughter of <prn id='Q32133'>Lysimachus</prn>. His sister who had wedded him happened to die before this, leaving no issue, and there is in <pl id='Q11768'>Egypt</pl> a district called <prn id='Q42890017'>Arsinoites</prn> after her. </p>
<p id='1.8.1'><b>1.8.1</b> It is pertinent to add here an account of <prn id='Q110745'>Attalus</prn>, because he too is one of the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> eponymoi. A <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonian</pl> of the name of <prn id='Q740645'>Docimus</prn>, a general of <prn id='Q200401'>Antigonus</prn>, who afterwards surrendered both himself and his property to <prn id='Q32133'>Lysimachus</prn>, had a <pl id='Q622032'>Paphlagonian</pl> eunuch called <prn id='Q312452'>Philetaerus</prn>. All that <prn id='Q312452'>Philetaerus</prn> did to further the revolt from <prn id='Q32133'>Lysimachus</prn>, and how he won over <prn id='Q184176'>Seleucus</prn>, will form an episode in my account of <prn id='Q32133'>Lysimachus</prn>. <prn id='Q110745'>Attalus</prn>, however, son of <prn id='Q110745'>Attalus</prn> and nephew of <prn id='Q312452'>Philetaerus</prn>, received the kingdom from his cousin <prn id='Q297366'>Eumenes</prn>, who handed it over. The greatest of his achievements was his forcing the Gauls to retire from the sea into the country which they still hold. </p>
<p id='1.8.2'><b>1.8.2</b> After the statues of the <pl id='Q2094507'>Eponymoi</pl> come statues of gods, <prn id='Q330584'>Amphiaraus</prn>, and <prn id='Q214987'>Eirene</prn> (Peace) carrying the boy <prn id='Q205251'>Plutus</prn> (Wealth). Here stands a bronze figure of <prn id='Q373685'>Lycurgus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q432737'>Lycophron</prn>, and of <prn id='Q970958'>Callias</prn>, who, as most of the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> say, brought about the peace between the Greeks and <prn id='Q189689'>Artaxerxes</prn>, son of <prn id='Q129165'>Xerxes</prn>.

<p id='1.8.3'><b>1.8.3</b> Exiled for the second time <prn id='Q117253'>Demosthenes</prn> crossed once more to <pl id='Q1443132'>Calauria</pl>, and committed suicide there by taking poison, being the only Greek exile whom <prn id='Q10396005'>Archias</prn> failed to bring back to <prn id='Q204760'>Antipater</prn> and the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl>. This <prn id='Q10396005'>Archias</prn> was a <pl id='Q602564'>Thurian</pl> who undertook the abominable task of bringing to <prn id='Q204760'>Antipater</prn> for punishment those who had opposed the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> before the Greeks met with their defeat in <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessaly</pl>. Such was <prn id='Q117253'>Demosthenes</prn>' reward for his great devotion to <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>.

<p id='1.8.4'><b>1.8.4</b> Near the statue of <prn id='Q117253'>Demosthenes</prn> is a <pl id='Q2405583'>sanctuary</pl> of <prn id='Q40901'>Ares</prn>, where are placed two images of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>, one of <prn id='Q40901'>Ares</prn> made by <prn id='Q505640'>Alcamenes</prn>, and one of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> made by a <pl id='Q65040323'>Parian</pl> of the name of <prn id='Q60234609'>Locrus</prn>. There is also an image of <prn id='Q3725417'>Enyo</prn>, made by the sons of <prn id='Q105290'>Praxiteles</prn>. About the <pl id='Q2405583'>temple</pl> stand images of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>, <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> binding his hair with a fillet, and statues of Calades, who it is said framed laws for the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, and of <prn id='Q134929'>Pindar</prn>, the statue being one of the rewards the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> gave him for praising them in an ode. </p>
<p id='1.8.5'><b>1.8.5</b> Hard by stand <pl id='Q3250992'>statues</pl> of <prn id='Q21546504'>Harmodius</prn> and <prn id='Q718117'>Aristogiton</prn>, who killed <prn id='Q435531'>Hipparchus</prn>. The reason of this act and the method of its execution have been related by others; of the figures some were made by <prn id='Q1186159'>Critius</prn>, the old ones being the work of <prn id='Q552633'>Antenor</prn>. When <prn id='Q129165'>Xerxes</prn> took <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> after the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> had abandoned the city he took away these statues also among the spoils, but they were afterwards restored to the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> by <prn id='Q211488'>Antiochus</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.8.6'><b>1.8.6</b> Before the entrance of the theater which they call the <pl id='Q745797'>Odeum</pl> (Music Hall) are statues of <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptian</pl> kings. They are all alike called <prn id='Q131976'>Ptolemy</prn>, but each has his own surname. For they call one <prn id='Q39952'>Philometor</prn>, and another <prn id='Q39576'>Philadelphus</prn>, while the son of <prn id='Q718154'>Lagus</prn> is called <prn id='Q168261'>Soter</prn>, a name given him by the <pl id='Q13533316'>Rhodians</pl>. Of these, <prn id='Q39576'>Philadelphus</prn> is he whom I have mentioned before among the eponymoi, and near him is a statue of his sister <prn id='Q40234'>Arsinoe</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.9.1'><b>1.9.1</b> The one called <prn id='Q3340'>Philometor</prn> is eighth in descent from <prn id='Q168261'>Ptolemy</prn> son of <prn id='Q718154'>Lagus</prn>, and his surname was given him in sarcastic mockery, for we know of none of the kings who was so hated by his mother. Although he was the eldest of her children she would not allow him to be called to the throne, but prevailed on his father before the call came to send him to <pl id='Q644636'>Cyprus</pl>. Among the reasons assigned for <prn id='Q40003'>Cleopatra</prn>'s enmity towards her son is her expectation that <prn id='Q3345'>Alexander</prn> the younger of her sons would prove more subservient, and this consideration induced her to urge the <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptians</pl> to choose <prn id='Q3345'>Alexander</prn> as king. </p>
<p id='1.9.2'><b>1.9.2</b> When the people offered opposition, she dispatched <prn id='Q3345'>Alexander</prn> for the second time to <pl id='Q644636'>Cyprus</pl>, ostensibly as general, but really because she wished by his means to make <prn id='Q3340'>Ptolemy</prn> more afraid of her. Finally she covered with wounds those eunuchs she thought best disposed, and presented them to the people, making out that she was the victim of <prn id='Q3340'>Ptolemy</prn>'s machinations, and that he had treated the eunuchs in such a fashion. The people of <pl id='Q87'>Alexandria</pl> rushed to kill <prn id='Q3340'>Ptolemy</prn>, and when he escaped on board a ship, made <prn id='Q3345'>Alexander</prn>, who returned from <pl id='Q644636'>Cyprus</pl>, their king. </p>
<p id='1.9.3'><b>1.9.3</b> Retribution for the exile of <prn id='Q3340'>Ptolemy</prn> came upon <prn id='Q40003'>Cleopatra</prn>, for she was put to death by <prn id='Q3345'>Alexander</prn>, whom she herself had made to be king of the <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptians</pl>. When the deed was discovered, and <prn id='Q3345'>Alexander</prn> fled in fear of the citizens, <prn id='Q3340'>Ptolemy</prn> returned and for the second time assumed control of <pl id='Q11768'>Egypt</pl>. He made war against the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl>, who had revolted, reduced them two years after the revolt, and treated them so cruelly that they were left not even a memorial of their former prosperity, which had so grown that they surpassed in wealth the richest of the Greeks, the sanctuary of <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> and the <pl id='Q543895'>Orchomenians</pl>. Shortly after this <prn id='Q3340'>Ptolemy</prn> met with his appointed fate, and the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, who had been benefited by him in many ways which I need not stop to relate, set up a bronze likeness of him and of <prn id='Q231688'>Berenice</prn>, his only legitimate child. </p>
<p id='1.9.4'><b>1.9.4</b> After the <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptians</pl> come statues of <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn> and of his son <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn>. The events of their lives were too important to form a mere digression in another story. Now the <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptians</pl> had their honors bestowed upon them out of genuine respect and because they were benefactors, but it was rather the sycophancy of the people that gave them to <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn> and <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn>, since they set up a statue to <prn id='Q32133'>Lysimachus</prn> also not so much out of goodwill as because they thought to serve their immediate ends. </p>
<p id='1.9.5'><b>1.9.5</b> This <prn id='Q32133'>Lysimachus</prn> was a <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonian</pl> by birth and one of <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn>'s body-guards, whom <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn> once in anger shut up in a chamber with a <prn id='Q140'>lion</prn>, and afterwards found that he had overpowered the brute. Henceforth he always treated him with respect, and honored him as much as the noblest <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl>. After the death of <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn>, <prn id='Q32133'>Lysimachus</prn> ruled such of the <pl id='Q41741'>Thracians</pl>, who are neighbors of the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl>, as had been under the sway of <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn> and before him of <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn>. These would comprise but a small part of <pl id='Q41741'>Thrace</pl>. If race be compared with race no nation of men except the <pl id='Q35966'>Celts</pl> are more numerous than the <pl id='Q41741'>Thracians</pl> taken all together, and for this reason no one before the Romans reduced the whole Thracian population. But the Romans have subdued all <pl id='Q41741'>Thrace</pl>, and they also hold such <pl id='Q35966'>Celtic</pl> territory as is worth possessing, but they have intentionally overlooked the parts that they consider useless through excessive cold or barrenness. </p>
<p id='1.9.6'><b>1.9.6</b> Then <prn id='Q32133'>Lysimachus</prn> made war against his neighbours, first the <pl id='Q2987531'>Odrysae</pl>, secondly the <pl id='Q19012'>Getae</pl> and <prn id='Q554861'>Dromichaetes</prn>. Engaging with men not unversed in warfare and far his superiors in number, he himself escaped from a position of extreme danger, but his son <prn id='Q391454'>Agathocles</prn>, who was serving with him then for the first time, was taken prisoner by the <pl id='Q19012'>Getae</pl>. <prn id='Q32133'>Lysimachus</prn> met with other reverses afterwards, and attaching great importance to the capture of his son made peace with <prn id='Q554861'>Dromichaetes</prn>, yielding to the <pl id='Q19012'>Getic</pl> king the parts of his empire beyond the <pl id='Q1653'>Ister</pl>, and, chiefly under compulsion, giving him his daughter in marriage. Others say that not <prn id='Q391454'>Agathocles</prn> but <prn id='Q32133'>Lysimachus</prn> himself was taken prisoner, regaining his liberty when <prn id='Q391454'>Agathocles</prn> treated with the <pl id='Q19012'>Getic</pl> king on his behalf. On his return he married to <prn id='Q391454'>Agathocles</prn> <prn id='Q289276'>Lysandra</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q168261'>Ptolemy</prn>, son of <prn id='Q718154'>Lagus</prn>, and of <prn id='Q233771'>Eurydice</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.9.7'><b>1.9.7</b> He also crossed with a fleet to <prn id='Q48'>Asia</prn> and helped to overthrow the empire of <prn id='Q200401'>Antigonus</prn>. He founded also the modern city of <pl id='Q47611'>Ephesus</pl> as far as the coast, bringing to it as settlers people of <pl id='Q302905'>Lebedos</pl> and <pl id='Q1142488'>Colophon</pl>, after destroying their cities, so that the iambic poet <prn id='Q10287061'>Phoenix</prn> composed a lament for the capture of <pl id='Q1142488'>Colophon</pl>. <prn id='Q1613558'>Hermesianax</prn>, the elegiac writer, was, I think, no longer living, otherwise he too would certainly have been moved by the taking of <pl id='Q1142488'>Colophon</pl> to write a dirge. <prn id='Q32133'>Lysimachus</prn> also went to war with <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q403377'>Aeacides</prn>. Waiting for his departure from <pl id='Q565751'>Epeirus</pl> (<prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn> was of a very roving disposition) he ravaged <pl id='Q565751'>Epeirus</pl> until he reached the royal tombs. </p>
<p id='1.9.8'><b>1.9.8</b> The next part of the story is incredible to me, but <prn id='Q435274'>Hieronymus</prn> the <pl id='Q965581'>Cardian</pl> relates that he destroyed the tombs and cast out the bones of the dead. But this <prn id='Q435274'>Hieronymus</prn> has a reputation generally of being biased against all the kings except <prn id='Q200401'>Antigonus</prn>, and of being unfairly partial towards him. As to the treatment of the <pl id='Q565751'>Epeirot</pl> graves, it is perfectly plain that it was malice that made him record that a <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonian</pl> desecrated the tombs of the dead. Besides, <prn id='Q32133'>Lysimachus</prn> was surely aware that they were the ancestors not of <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn> only but also of <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn>. In fact <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn> was an <pl id='Q565751'>Epeirot</pl> and an <prn id='Q403361'>Aeacid</prn> on his mother's side, and the subsequent alliance between <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn> and <prn id='Q32133'>Lysimachus</prn> proves that even as enemies they were not irreconcilable. Possibly <prn id='Q435274'>Hieronymus</prn> had grievances against <prn id='Q32133'>Lysimachus</prn>, especially his destroying the city of the <pl id='Q965581'>Cardians</pl> and founding <pl id='Q517690'>Lysimachia</pl> in its stead on the isthmus of the Thracian <pl id='Q192860'>Chersonesus</pl>. </p>
<p id='1.10.1'><b>1.10.1</b> As long as <prn id='Q295530'>Aridaeus</prn> reigned, and after him <prn id='Q207183'>Cassander</prn> and his sons, friendly relations continued between <prn id='Q32133'>Lysimachus</prn> and <pl id='Q81734'>Macedon</pl>. But when the kingdom devolved upon <prn id='Q59734'>Demetrius</prn>, son of <prn id='Q200401'>Antigonus</prn>, <prn id='Q32133'>Lysimachus</prn>, henceforth expecting that war would be declared upon him by <prn id='Q59734'>Demetrius</prn>, resolved to take aggressive action. He was aware that <prn id='Q59734'>Demetrius</prn> inherited a tendency to aggrandise, and he also knew that he visited <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl> at the summons of <prn id='Q207847'>Alexander</prn> and <prn id='Q207183'>Cassander</prn>, and on his arrival murdered <prn id='Q207847'>Alexander</prn> himself and ruled the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> in his stead. </p>
<p id='1.10.2'><b>1.10.2</b> Therefore encountering <prn id='Q59734'>Demetrius</prn> at <pl id='Q217414'>Amphipolis</pl> he came near to being expelled from <pl id='Q41741'>Thrace</pl>, but on <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn>' coming to his aid he mastered <pl id='Q41741'>Thrace</pl> and afterwards extended his empire at the expense of the <pl id='Q193904'>Nestians</pl> and <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl>. The greater part of <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl> was under the control of <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn> himself, who came from <pl id='Q565751'>Epeirus</pl> with an army and was at that time on friendly terms with <prn id='Q32133'>Lysimachus</prn>. When however <prn id='Q59734'>Demetrius</prn> crossed over into <prn id='Q48'>Asia</prn> and made war on <prn id='Q184176'>Seleucus</prn>, the alliance between <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn> and <prn id='Q32133'>Lysimachus</prn> lasted only as long as <prn id='Q59734'>Demetrius</prn> continued hostilities; when <prn id='Q59734'>Demetrius</prn> submitted to <prn id='Q184176'>Seleucus</prn>, the friendship between <prn id='Q32133'>Lysimachus</prn> and <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn> was broken, and when war broke out <prn id='Q32133'>Lysimachus</prn> fought against <prn id='Q241386'>Antigonus</prn> son of <prn id='Q59734'>Demetrius</prn> and against <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn> himself, had much the better of the struggle, conquered <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl> and forced <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn> to retreat to <pl id='Q565751'>Epeirus</pl>. </p>
<p id='1.10.3'><b>1.10.3</b> <prn id='Q121973'>Eros</prn> is wont to bring many calamities upon men. <prn id='Q32133'>Lysimachus</prn>, although by this time of mature age and considered happy in respect of his children, and although <prn id='Q391454'>Agathocles</prn> had children by <prn id='Q289276'>Lysandra</prn>, nevertheless married <prn id='Q289276'>Lysandra</prn>'s sister <prn id='Q40234'>Arsinoe</prn>. This <prn id='Q40234'>Arsinoe</prn>, fearing for her children, lest on the death of <prn id='Q32133'>Lysimachus</prn> they should fall into the hands of <prn id='Q391454'>Agathocles</prn>, is said for this reason to have plotted against <prn id='Q391454'>Agathocles</prn>. Historians have already related how <prn id='Q40234'>Arsinoe</prn> fell in love with <prn id='Q391454'>Agathocles</prn>, and being unsuccessful they say that she plotted against his life. They say also that <prn id='Q32133'>Lysimachus</prn> discovered later his wife's machinations, but was by this time powerless, having lost all his friends. </p>
<p id='1.10.4'><b>1.10.4</b> Since <prn id='Q32133'>Lysimachus</prn>, then, overlooked <prn id='Q40234'>Arsinoe</prn>'s murder of <prn id='Q391454'>Agathocles</prn>, <prn id='Q289276'>Lysandra</prn> fled to <prn id='Q184176'>Seleucus</prn>, taking with her her children and her brothers, who were taking refuge with <prn id='Q168261'>Ptolemy</prn> and finally adopted this course. They were accompanied on their flight to <prn id='Q184176'>Seleucus</prn> by <prn id='Q886688'>Alexander</prn> who was the son of <prn id='Q32133'>Lysimachus</prn> by an <pl id='Q2987531'>Odrysian</pl> woman. So they going up to <pl id='Q5684'>Babylon</pl> entreated <prn id='Q184176'>Seleucus</prn> to make war on <prn id='Q32133'>Lysimachus</prn>. And at the same time <prn id='Q312452'>Philetaerus</prn>, to whom the property of <prn id='Q32133'>Lysimachus</prn> had been entrusted, aggrieved at the death of <prn id='Q391454'>Agathocles</prn> and suspicious of the treatment he would receive at the hands of <prn id='Q40234'>Arsinoe</prn>, seized <pl id='Q18986'>Pergamus</pl> on the <pl id='Q1737602'>Caicus</pl>, and sending a herald offered both the property and himself to <prn id='Q184176'>Seleucus</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.10.5'><b>1.10.5</b> <prn id='Q32133'>Lysimachus</prn> hearing of all these things lost no time in crossing into <prn id='Q48'>Asia</prn>, and assuming the initiative met <prn id='Q184176'>Seleucus</prn>, suffered a severe defeat and was killed. <prn id='Q886688'>Alexander</prn>, his son by the <pl id='Q2987531'>Odrysian</pl> woman, after interceding long with <prn id='Q289276'>Lysandra</prn>, won his body and afterwards carried it to the <pl id='Q192860'>Chersonesus</pl> and buried it, where his grave is still to be seen between the village of <pl id='Q965581'>Cardia</pl> and <pl id='Q7123145'>Pactye</pl>. </p>
<p id='1.11.1'><b>1.11.1</b> Such was the history of <prn id='Q32133'>Lysimachus</prn>. The <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> have also a statue of <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn>. This <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn> was not related to <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn>, except by ancestry. <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn> was son of <prn id='Q403377'>Aeacides</prn>, son of <prn id='Q511880'>Arybbas</prn>, but <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn> was son of <prn id='Q223134'>Olympias</prn>, daughter of <prn id='Q13230617'>Neoptolemus</prn>, and the father of <prn id='Q13230617'>Neoptolemus</prn> and <prn id='Q511880'>Arybbas</prn> was <prn id='Q729118'>Alcetas</prn>, son of <prn id='Q598904'>Tharypus</prn>. And from <prn id='Q598904'>Tharypus</prn> to <prn id='Q322639'>Pyrrhus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn>, are fifteen generations. Now <prn id='Q322639'>Pyrrhus</prn> was the first who after the capture of <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl> disdained to return to <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessaly</pl>, but sailing to <pl id='Q565751'>Epeirus</pl> dwelt there because of the oracles of <prn id='Q729332'>Helenus</prn>. By <prn id='Q658523'>Hermione</prn> <prn id='Q322639'>Pyrrhus</prn> had no child, but by <prn id='Q19376'>Andromache</prn> he had <prn id='Q2622614'>Molossus</prn>, <prn id='Q2362553'>Pielus</prn>, and <prn id='Q2097787'>Pergamus</prn>, who was the youngest. <prn id='Q729332'>Helenus</prn> also had a son, <prn id='Q1045153'>Cestrinus</prn>, being married to <prn id='Q19376'>Andromache</prn> after the murder of <prn id='Q322639'>Pyrrhus</prn> at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>. </p>
<p id='1.11.2'><b>1.11.2</b> <prn id='Q729332'>Helenus</prn> on his death passed on the kingdom to <prn id='Q2622614'>Molossus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q322639'>Pyrrhus</prn>, so that <prn id='Q1045153'>Cestrinus</prn> with volunteers from the <pl id='Q565751'>Epeirots</pl> took possession of the region beyond the river <pl id='Q1721931'>Thyamis</pl>, while <prn id='Q2097787'>Pergamus</prn> crossed into <prn id='Q48'>Asia</prn> and killed <prn id='Q30057580'>Areius</prn>, despot in <pl id='Q11951693'>Teuthrania</pl>, who fought with him in single combat for his kingdom, and gave his name to the city which is still called after him. To <prn id='Q19376'>Andromache</prn>, who accompanied him, there is still a shrine in the city. <prn id='Q2362553'>Pielus</prn> remained behind in <pl id='Q565751'>Epeirus</pl>, and to him as ancestor <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q403377'>Aeacides</prn>, and his fathers traced their descent, and not to <prn id='Q2622614'>Molossus</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.11.3'><b>1.11.3</b> Down to <prn id='Q716355'>Alcetas</prn>, son of <prn id='Q598904'>Tharypus</prn>, <pl id='Q565751'>Epeirus</pl> too was under one king. But the sons of <prn id='Q716355'>Alcetas</prn> after a quarrel agreed to rule with equal authority, remaining faithful to their compact; and afterwards, when <prn id='Q335658'>Alexander</prn>, son of <prn id='Q13230617'>Neoptolemus</prn>, died among the <pl id='Q1264391'>Leucani</pl>, and <prn id='Q223134'>Olympias</prn> returned to <pl id='Q565751'>Epeirus</pl> through fear of <prn id='Q204760'>Antipater</prn>, <prn id='Q403377'>Aeacides</prn>, son of <prn id='Q511880'>Arybbas</prn>, continued in allegiance to <prn id='Q223134'>Olympias</prn> and joined in her campaign against <prn id='Q295530'>Aridaeus</prn> and the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl>, although the <pl id='Q565751'>Epeirots</pl> refused to accompany him. </p>
<p id='1.11.4'><b>1.11.4</b> <prn id='Q223134'>Olympias</prn> on her victory behaved wickedly in the matter of the death of <prn id='Q295530'>Aridaeus</prn>, and much more wickedly to certain <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl>, and for this reason was considered to have deserved her subsequent treatment at the hands of <prn id='Q207183'>Cassander</prn>; so <prn id='Q403377'>Aeacides</prn> at first was not received even by the <pl id='Q565751'>Epeirots</pl> because of their hatred of <prn id='Q223134'>Olympias</prn>, and when afterwards they forgave him, his return to <pl id='Q565751'>Epeirus</pl> was next opposed by <prn id='Q207183'>Cassander</prn>. When a battle occurred at Oeneadae between <prn id='Q3621605'>Philip</prn>, brother of <prn id='Q207183'>Cassander</prn>, and <prn id='Q403377'>Aeacides</prn>, <prn id='Q403377'>Aeacides</prn> was wounded and shortly after met his fate. </p>
<p id='1.11.5'><b>1.11.5</b> The <pl id='Q565751'>Epeirots</pl> accepted <prn id='Q716355'>Alcetas</prn> as their king, being the son of <prn id='Q511880'>Arybbas</prn> and the elder brother of <prn id='Q403377'>Aeacides</prn>, but of an uncontrollable temper and on this account banished by his father. Immediately on his arrival he began to vent his fury on the <pl id='Q565751'>Epeirots</pl>, until they rose up and put him and his children to death at night. After killing him they brought back <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q403377'>Aeacides</prn>. No sooner had he arrived than <prn id='Q207183'>Cassander</prn> made war upon him, while he was young in years and before he had consolidated his empire. When the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> attacked him, <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn> went to <prn id='Q168261'>Ptolemy</prn>, son of <prn id='Q718154'>Lagus</prn>, in <pl id='Q11768'>Egypt</pl>. <prn id='Q168261'>Ptolemy</prn> gave him to wife the half-sister of his children, and restored him by an <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptian</pl> force. </p>
<p id='1.11.6'><b>1.11.6</b> The first Greeks that <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn> attacked on becoming king were the <pl id='Q3693378'>Corcyraeans</pl>. He saw that the island lay off his own territory, and he did not wish others to have a base from which to attack him. My account of <prn id='Q32133'>Lysimachus</prn> has already related how he fared, after taking <pl id='Q3693378'>Corcyra</pl>, in his war with <prn id='Q32133'>Lysimachus</prn>, how he expelled <prn id='Q59734'>Demetrius</prn> and ruled <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl> until he was in turn expelled by <prn id='Q32133'>Lysimachus</prn>, the most important of his achievements until he waged war against the Romans, </p>
<p id='1.11.7'><b>1.11.7</b> being the first Greek we know of to do so. For no further battle, it is said, took place between <prn id='Q82732'>Aeneas</prn> and <prn id='Q208256'>Diomedes</prn> with his <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>. One of the many ambitions of the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> was to reduce all <pl id='Q913582'>Italy</pl>, but the disaster at <pl id='Q4420718'>Syracuse</pl> prevented their trying conclusions with the Romans. <prn id='Q335658'>Alexander</prn>, son of <prn id='Q13230617'>Neoptolemus</prn>, of the same family as <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn> but older, died among the <pl id='Q1264391'>Leucani</pl> before he could meet the Romans in battle. </p>
<p id='1.12.1'><b>1.12.1</b> So <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn> was the first to cross the <pl id='Q37495'>Ionian Sea</pl> from Greece to attack the Romans. And even he crossed on the invitation of the <pl id='Q3981082'>Tarentines</pl>. For they were already involved in a war with the Romans, but were no match for them unaided. <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn> was already in their debt, because they had sent a fleet to help him in his war with <pl id='Q3693378'>Corcyra</pl>, but the most cogent arguments of the <pl id='Q3981082'>Tarentine</pl> envoys were their accounts of <pl id='Q913582'>Italy</pl>, how its prosperity was equal to that of the whole of Greece, and their plea that it was wicked to dismiss them when they had come as friends and suppliants in their hour of need. When the envoys urged these considerations, <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn> remembered the capture of <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl>, which he took to be an omen of his success in the war, as he was a descendant of <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn> making war upon a colony of <pl id='Q22647'>Trojans</pl>. </p>
<p id='1.12.2'><b>1.12.2</b> Pleased with this proposal, and being a man who never lost time when once he had made up his mind, he immediately proceeded to man war ships and to prepare transports to carry <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn> and men-at-arms. There are books written by men of no renown as authors, entitled “Memoirs.” When I read these I marvelled greatly both at the personal bravery of <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn> in battle, and also at the forethought he displayed whenever a contest was imminent. So on this occasion also when crossing to <pl id='Q913582'>Italy</pl> with a fleet he eluded the observation of the Romans, and for some time after his arrival they were unaware of his presence; it was only when the Romans made an attack upon the <pl id='Q3981082'>Tarentines</pl> that he appeared on the scene with his army, and his unexpected assault naturally threw his enemies into confusion. </p>
<p id='1.12.3'><b>1.12.3</b> And being perfectly aware that he was no match for the Romans, he prepared to let loose against them his elephants. The first European to acquire elephants was <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn>, after subduing <prn id='Q28935'>Porus</prn> and the power of the <pl id='Q17055962'>Indians</pl>; after his death others of the kings got them but <prn id='Q200401'>Antigonus</prn> more than any; <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn> captured his beasts in the battle with <prn id='Q59734'>Demetrius</prn>. When on this occasion they came in sight the Romans were seized with panic, and did not believe they were animals. </p>
<p id='1.12.4'><b>1.12.4</b> For although the use of ivory in arts and crafts all men obviously have known from of old, the actual beasts, before the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> crossed into <prn id='Q48'>Asia</prn>, nobody had seen at all except the <pl id='Q17055962'>Indians</pl> themselves, the <pl id='Q2370577'>Libyans</pl>, and their neighbours. This is proved by <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>, who describes the couches and houses of the more prosperous kings as ornamented with ivory, but never mentions the beast; but if he had seen or heard about it he would, in my opinion have been much more likely to speak of it than of the <prn id='Q30753390'>battle</prn> between the <prn id='Q1747200'>Pygmies</prn> and cranes. </p>
<p id='1.12.5'><b>1.12.5</b> <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn> was brought over to <pl id='Q4951156'>Sicily</pl> by an embassy of the <pl id='Q4420718'>Syracusans</pl>. The <pl id='Q6343'>Carthaginians</pl> had crossed over and were destroying the Greek cities, and had sat down to invest <pl id='Q4420718'>Syracuse</pl>, the only one now remaining. When <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn> heard this from the envoys he abandoned <pl id='Q3981082'>Tarentum</pl> and the Italiots on the coast, and crossing into <pl id='Q4951156'>Sicily</pl> forced the <pl id='Q6343'>Carthaginians</pl> to raise the siege of <pl id='Q4420718'>Syracuse</pl>. In his self-conceit, although the <pl id='Q6343'>Carthaginians</pl>, being <pl id='Q41642'>Phoenicians</pl> of <pl id='Q58455019'>Tyre</pl> by ancient descent, were more experienced sea men than any other non-Greek people of that day, <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn> was nevertheless encouraged to meet them in a naval battle, employing the <pl id='Q565751'>Epeirots</pl>, the majority of whom, even after the capture of <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl>, knew no thing of the sea nor even as yet how to use salt. Witness the words of <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> in the <prn id='Q35160'>Odyssey</prn>: — Nothing they know of ocean, and mix not salt with their victuals.” 11.122 </p>
<p id='1.13.1'><b>1.13.1</b> Worsted on this occasion <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn> put back with the remainder of his vessels to <pl id='Q3981082'>Tarentum</pl>. Here he met with a serious reverse, and his retirement, for he knew that the Romans would not let him depart without striking a blow, he contrived in the following manner. On his return from <pl id='Q4951156'>Sicily</pl> and his defeat, he first sent various dispatches to <prn id='Q48'>Asia</prn> and to <prn id='Q241386'>Antigonus</prn>, asking some of the kings for troops, some for money, and <prn id='Q241386'>Antigonus</prn> for both. When the envoys returned and their dispatches were delivered, he summoned those in authority, whether <pl id='Q565751'>Epeirot</pl> or <pl id='Q3981082'>Tarentine</pl>, and without reading any of the dispatches declared that reinforcements would come. A report spread quickly even to the Romans that <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> and Asiatic tribes also were crossing to the aid of <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn>. The Romans, on hearing this, made no move, but <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn> on the approach of that very night crossed to the headlands of the mountains called <pl id='Q1054699'>Ceraunian</pl>. </p>
<p id='1.13.2'><b>1.13.2</b> After the defeat in <pl id='Q913582'>Italy</pl> <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn> gave his forces a rest and then declared war on <prn id='Q241386'>Antigonus</prn>, his chief ground of complaint being the failure to send reinforcements to <pl id='Q913582'>Italy</pl>. Overpowering the native troops of <prn id='Q241386'>Antigonus</prn> an his Gallic mercenaries he pursued them to the coast cities, and himself reduced upper <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl> and the <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessalians</pl>. The extent of the fighting and the decisive character of the victory of <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn> are shown best by the <pl id='Q35966'>Celtic</pl> armour dedicated in the sanctuary of Itonian <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> between <pl id='Q1330631'>Pherae</pl> and <pl id='Q178405'>Larisa</pl>, with this inscription on them: </p>
<p id='1.13.3'><b>1.13.3</b> “<prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn> the <pl id='Q11937293'>Molossian</pl> hung these shields <br>taken from the bold Gauls as a gift to Itonian <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, when he had destroyed all the host <br>of <prn id='Q241386'>Antigonus</prn>. 'Tis no great marvel. The <prn id='Q403361'>Aeacidae</prn> are warriors now, even as they were of old.” <br>These shields then are here, but the bucklers of the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> themselves he dedicated to <pl id='Q382317'>Dodonian</pl> <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>. They too have an inscription: <br>“These once ravaged golden <prn id='Q48'>Asia</prn>, and brought slavery upon the Greeks. Now ownerless they lie by the pillars of the temple of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, spoils of boastful <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl>.” <br><prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn> came very near to reducing <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl> entirely, but, </p>
<p id='1.13.4'><b>1.13.4</b> being usually readier to do what came first to hand, he was prevented by <prn id='Q930518'>Cleonymus</prn>. This <prn id='Q930518'>Cleonymus</prn>, who persuaded <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn> to abandon his <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonian</pl> adventure and to go to the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl>, was a <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> who led an hostile army into the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> territory for a reason which I will relate after giving the descent of <prn id='Q930518'>Cleonymus</prn>. <prn id='Q314518'>Pausanias</prn>, who was in command of the Greeks at <pl id='Q204636'>Plataea</pl>, was the father of <prn id='Q371564'>Pleistoanax</prn>, he of <prn id='Q433408'>Pausanias</prn>, and he of <prn id='Q373660'>Cleombrotus</prn>, who was killed at <pl id='Q2606004'>Leuctra</pl> fighting against <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn> and the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl>. <prn id='Q373660'>Cleombrotus</prn> was the father of <prn id='Q393079'>Agesipolis</prn> and <prn id='Q464632'>Cleomenes</prn>, and, <prn id='Q393079'>Agesipolis</prn> dying without issue, <prn id='Q464632'>Cleomenes</prn> ascended the throne. </p>
<p id='1.13.5'><b>1.13.5</b> <prn id='Q464632'>Cleomenes</prn> had two sons, the elder being <prn id='Q421190'>Acrotatus</prn> and the younger <prn id='Q930518'>Cleonymus</prn>. Now <prn id='Q421190'>Acrotatus</prn> died first; and when afterwards <prn id='Q464632'>Cleomenes</prn> died, a claim to the throne was put forward by <prn id='Q643609'>Areus</prn> son of <prn id='Q421190'>Acrotatus</prn>, and <prn id='Q930518'>Cleonymus</prn> took steps to induce <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn> to enter the country. Before the battle of <pl id='Q2606004'>Leuctra</pl> the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> had suffered no disaster, so that they even refused to admit that they had yet been worsted in a land battle. For <prn id='Q44228'>Leonidas</prn>, they said, had won the victory, but his followers were insufficient for the entire destruction of the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl>; the achievement of <prn id='Q504986'>Demosthenes</prn> and the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> on the island of <pl id='Q1303524'>Sphacteria</pl> was no victory, but only a trick in war. </p>
<p id='1.13.6'><b>1.13.6</b> Their first reverse took place in <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl>, and they afterwards suffered a severe defeat at the hands of <prn id='Q204760'>Antipater</prn> and the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl>. Thirdly the war with <prn id='Q59734'>Demetrius</prn> came as an unexpected misfortune to their land. Invaded by <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn> and seeing a hostile army for the fourth time, they arrayed themselves to meet it along with the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> and <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> who had come as their allies. <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn> won the day, and came near to capturing <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> without further fighting, but desisted for a while after ravaging the land and carrying off plunder. The citizens prepared for a siege, and <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> even before this in the war with <prn id='Q59734'>Demetrius</prn> had been fortified with deep trenches and strong stakes, and at the most vulnerable points with buildings as well. </p>
<p id='1.13.7'><b>1.13.7</b> Just about this time, while the <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconian</pl> war was dragging on, <prn id='Q241386'>Antigonus</prn>, having recovered the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonian</pl> cities, hastened to the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl> being well aware that if <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn> were to reduce <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl> and the greater part of the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl>, he would not return to <pl id='Q565751'>Epeirus</pl> but to <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl> to make war there again. When <prn id='Q241386'>Antigonus</prn> was about to lead his army from <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> into <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconia</pl>, <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn> himself reached <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>. Victorious once more he dashed into the city along with the fugitives, and his formation not unnaturally was broken up. </p>
<p id='1.13.8'><b>1.13.8</b> When the fighting was now taking place by sanctuaries and houses, and in the narrow lanes, between detached bodies in different parts of the town, <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn> left by himself was wounded in the head. It is said that his death was caused by a blow from a tile thrown by a woman. The <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> however declare that it was not a woman who killed him but <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> in the likeness of a woman. This is what the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> themselves relate about his end, and <prn id='Q107287649'>Lyceas</prn>, the guide for the neighborhood, has written a poem which confirms the story. They have a sanctuary of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>, built at the command of the oracle, on the spot where <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn> died, and in it <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn> is buried. </p>
<p id='1.13.9'><b>1.13.9</b> I consider it remarkable that of those styled <prn id='Q403361'>Aeacidae</prn> three met their end by similar heaven-sent means; if, as <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> says, <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn> was killed by <prn id='Q167646'>Alexander</prn>, son of <prn id='Q170473'>Priam</prn>, and by <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, if the <pl id='Q75459'>Delphians</pl> were bidden by the <prn id='Q220344'>Pythia</prn> to slay <prn id='Q322639'>Pyrrhus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn>, and if the end of the son of <prn id='Q403377'>Aeacides</prn> was such as the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> say and <prn id='Q107287649'>Lyceas</prn> has described in his poem. The account, however, given by <prn id='Q435274'>Hieronymus</prn> the <pl id='Q965581'>Cardian</pl> is different, for a man who associates with royalty cannot help being a partial historian. If <prn id='Q712572'>Philistus</prn> was justified in suppressing the most wicked deeds of <prn id='Q332750'>Dionysius</prn>, because he expected his return to <pl id='Q4420718'>Syracuse</pl>, surely <prn id='Q435274'>Hieronymus</prn> may be fully forgiven for writing to please <prn id='Q241386'>Antigonus</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.14.1'><b>1.14.1</b> So ended the period of EpeirotYY ascendancy. When you have entered the <pl id='Q745797'>Odeum</pl> at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> you meet, among other objects, a figure of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> worth seeing. Hard by is a spring called Enneacrunos (Nine Jets), embellished as you see it by <prn id='Q242172'>Peisistratus</prn>. There are cisterns all over the city, but this is the only fountain. Above the spring are two temples, one to <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> and <prn id='Q45967'>Kore</prn>, while in that of <prn id='Q269243'>Triptolemus</prn> is a statue of him. The accounts given of <prn id='Q269243'>Triptolemus</prn> I shall write, omitting from the story as much as relates to <prn id='Q107389789'>Deiope</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.14.2'><b>1.14.2</b> The Greeks who dispute most the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> claim to antiquity and the gifts they say they have received from the gods are the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>, just as among those who are not Greeks the <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptians</pl> compete with the <pl id='Q32579'>Phrygians</pl>. It is said, then, that when <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> came to <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> she was received by <prn id='Q6070881'>Pelasgus</prn> into his home, and that <prn id='Q3697283'>Chrysanthis</prn>, knowing about the rape of <prn id='Q45967'>Kore</prn>, related the story to her. Afterwards <prn id='Q7844848'>Trochilus</prn>, the priest of the mysteries, fled, they say, from <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> because of the enmity of <prn id='Q429064'>Agenor</prn>, came to <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl> and married a woman of <pl id='Q11918833'>Eleusis</pl>, by whom he had two children, <prn id='Q1352687'>Eubuleus</prn> and <prn id='Q269243'>Triptolemus</prn>. That is the account given by the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>. But the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> and those who with them . . . know that <prn id='Q269243'>Triptolemus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q1141300'>Celeus</prn>, was the first to sow seed for cultivation. </p>
<p id='1.14.3'><b>1.14.3</b> Some extant verses of <prn id='Q728059'>Musaeus</prn>, if indeed they are to be included among his works, say that <prn id='Q269243'>Triptolemus</prn> was the son of <prn id='Q161419'>Oceanus</prn> and <prn id='Q93172'>Earth</prn>; while those ascribed to <prn id='Q174353'>Orpheus</prn> (though in my opinion the received authorship is again incorrect) say that <prn id='Q1352687'>Eubuleus</prn> and <prn id='Q269243'>Triptolemus</prn> were sons of <prn id='Q4162118'>Dysaules</prn>, and that because they gave <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> information about her daughter the sowing of seed was her reward to them. But <prn id='Q1075809'>Choerilus</prn>, an <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl>, who wrote a play called <prn id='Q657562'>Alope</prn>, says that <prn id='Q1349772'>Cercyon</prn> and <prn id='Q269243'>Triptolemus</prn> were brothers, that their mother was the daughter of <prn id='Q474854'>Amphictyon</prn>, while the father of <prn id='Q269243'>Triptolemus</prn> was <prn id='Q1147081'>Rarus</prn>, of <prn id='Q1349772'>Cercyon</prn>, <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>. After I had intended to go further into this story, and to describe the contents of the sanctuary at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, called the <pl id='Q1349784'>Eleusinium</pl>, I was stayed by a vision in a dream. I shall therefore turn to those things it is lawful to write of to all men. </p>
<p id='1.14.4'><b>1.14.4</b> In front of this temple, where is also the statue of <prn id='Q269243'>Triptolemus</prn>, is a bronze <prn id='Q693690'>bull</prn> being led as it were to sacrifice, and there is a sitting figure of <prn id='Q319406'>Epimenides</prn> of <pl id='Q173527'>Cnossus</pl>, who they say entered a cave in the country and slept. And the sleep did not leave him before the fortieth year, and afterwards he wrote verses and purified <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> and other cities. But <prn id='Q2648488'>Thales</prn> who stayed the plague for the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> was not related to <prn id='Q319406'>Epimenides</prn> in any way, and belonged to a different city. The latter was from <pl id='Q173527'>Cnossus</pl>, but <prn id='Q2648488'>Thales</prn> was from <pl id='Q1136193'>Gortyn</pl>, according to <prn id='Q1238831'>Polymnastus</prn> of <pl id='Q1142488'>Colophon</pl>, who composed a poem about him for the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. </p>
<p id='1.14.5'><b>1.14.5</b> Still farther off is a temple to <prn id='Q3314305'>Eukleia</prn> (Glory), this too being a thank-offering for the victory over the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl>, who had landed at <pl id='Q31900'>Marathon</pl>. This is the victory of which I am of opinion the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> were proudest; while <prn id='Q40939'>Aeschylus</prn>, who had won such renown for his poetry and for his share in the naval battles before <pl id='Q105317807'>Artemisium</pl> and at <pl id='Q178850'>Salamis</pl>, recorded at the prospect of death nothing else, and merely wrote his name, his father's name, and the name of his city, and added that he had witnesses to his valor in the grove at <pl id='Q31900'>Marathon</pl> and in the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl> who landed there. </p>
<p id='1.14.6'><b>1.14.6</b> Above the <pl id='Q630974'>Cerameicus</pl> and the stoa called the <pl id='Q1670679'>Royal Stoa</pl> is a <pl id='Q756824'>temple</pl> of <prn id='Q44384'>Hephaestus</prn>. I was not surprised that by it stands a statue of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, because I knew the story about <prn id='Q644921'>Erichthonius</prn>. But when I saw that the statue of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> had blue eyes I found out that the legend about them is Libyan. For the <pl id='Q2370577'>Libyans</pl> have a saying that the Goddess is the daughter of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> and Lake <prn id='Q10384895'>Tritonis</prn>, and for this reason has blue eyes like <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.14.7'><b>1.14.7</b> Hard by is a <pl id='Q2118071'>sanctuary</pl> of the <prn id='Q35500'>Heavenly Aphrodite</prn>; the first men to establish her cult were the AssyriansYY, after the AssyriansYY the <pl id='Q22988494'>Paphians</pl> of <pl id='Q644636'>Cyprus</pl> and the <pl id='Q41642'>Phoenicians</pl> who live at <pl id='Q60956'>Ascalon</pl> in <pl id='Q23792'>Palestine</pl>; the <pl id='Q41642'>Phoenicians</pl> taught her worship to the people of <pl id='Q11855334'>Cythera</pl>. Among the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> the cult was established by <prn id='Q191725'>Aegeus</prn>, who thought that he was childless (he had, in fact, no children at the time) and that his sisters had suffered their misfortune because of the wrath of <prn id='Q35500'>Heavenly Aphrodite</prn>. The statue still extant is of <pl id='Q65040323'>Parian</pl> marble and is the work of <prn id='Q177302'>Pheidias</prn>. One of the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> demes is that of the <pl id='Q12872216'>Athmoneis</pl>, who say that <prn id='Q1421201'>Porphyrion</prn>, an earlier king than <prn id='Q421808'>Actaeus</prn>, founded their sanctuary of the Heavenly One. But the traditions current among the demes often differ altogether from those of the city. </p>
<p id='1.15.1'><b>1.15.1</b> As you go to the stoa which they call <pl id='Q936234'>Poikile</pl>, because of its pictures, there is a bronze statue of <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> <prn id='Q21548139'>Agoraios</prn>, and near it a gate. On it is a trophy erected by the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, who in a cavalry action overcame <prn id='Q438856'>Pleistarchus</prn>, to whose command his brother <prn id='Q207183'>Cassander</prn> had entrusted his cavalry and mercenaries. This <pl id='Q936234'>stoa</pl> contains, first, the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> arrayed against the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> at <pl id='Q30909902'>Oenoe</pl> in the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl> territory. What is depicted is not the crisis of the battle nor when the action had advanced as far as the display of deeds of valor, but the beginning of the fight when the combatants were about to close. </p>
<p id='1.15.2'><b>1.15.2</b> On the middle wall are the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> and <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> fighting with the <prn id='Q134154'>Amazons</prn>. So, it seems, only the women did not lose through their defeats their reckless courage in the face of danger; <pl id='Q122875'>Themiscyra</pl> was taken by <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, and afterwards the army which they dispatched to <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> was destroyed, but nevertheless they came to <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl> to fight all the Greeks as well as the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> them selves. After the <prn id='Q134154'>Amazons</prn> come the Greeks when they have taken <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl>, and the kings assembled on account of the outrage committed by <prn id='Q242319'>Ajax</prn> against <prn id='Q170779'>Cassandra</prn>. The picture includes <prn id='Q242319'>Ajax</prn> himself, <prn id='Q170779'>Cassandra</prn> and other captive women. </p>
<p id='1.15.3'><b>1.15.3</b> At the end of the painting are those who fought at <pl id='Q31900'>Marathon</pl>; the <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotians</pl> of <pl id='Q204636'>Plataea</pl> and the <pl id='Q122443'>Attic</pl> contingent are coming to blows with the foreigners. In this place neither side has the better, but the center of the fighting shows the foreigners in flight and pushing one another into the morass, while at the end of the painting are the <pl id='Q41642'>Phoenician</pl> ships, and the Greeks killing the foreigners who are scrambling into them. Here is also a portrait of the hero <prn id='Q1638952'>Marathon</prn>, after whom the plain is named, of <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> represented as coming up from the underworld, of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> and of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>. The <pl id='Q13423602'>Marathonians</pl>, according to their own account, were the first to regard <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> as a god. Of the fighters the most conspicuous figures in the painting are <prn id='Q364492'>Callimachus</prn>, who had been elected commander-in-chief by the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, <prn id='Q210350'>Miltiades</prn>, one of the generals, and a hero called <prn id='Q5332383'>Echetlus</prn>, of whom I shall make mention later. </p>
<p id='1.15.4'><b>1.15.4</b> Here are dedicated brazen shields, and some have an inscription that they are taken from the <pl id='Q963571'>Scioneans</pl> and their allies, while others, smeared with pitch lest they should be worn by age and rust, are said to be those of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> who were taken prisoners in the island of <pl id='Q1303524'>Sphacteria</pl>. </p>
<p id='1.16.1'><b>1.16.1</b> Here are placed bronze statues, one, in front of the stoa, of <prn id='Q133337'>Solon</prn>, who composed the laws for the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, and, a little farther away, one of <prn id='Q184176'>Seleucus</prn>, whose future prosperity was foreshadowed by unmistakable signs. When he was about to set forth from <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl> with <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn>, and was sacrificing at <pl id='Q213679'>Pella</pl> to <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, the wood that lay on the altar advanced of its own accord to the image and caught fire without the application of a light. On the death of <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn>, <prn id='Q184176'>Seleucus</prn>, in fear of <prn id='Q200401'>Antigonus</prn>, who had arrived at <pl id='Q5684'>Babylon</pl>, fled to <prn id='Q168261'>Ptolemy</prn>, son of <prn id='Q718154'>Lagus</prn>, and then returned again to <pl id='Q5684'>Babylon</pl>. On his return he overcame the army of <prn id='Q200401'>Antigonus</prn> and killed <prn id='Q200401'>Antigonus</prn> himself, afterwards capturing <prn id='Q59734'>Demetrius</prn>, son of <prn id='Q200401'>Antigonus</prn>, who had advanced with an army. </p>
<p id='1.16.2'><b>1.16.2</b> After these successes, which were shortly followed by the fall of <prn id='Q32133'>Lysimachus</prn>, he entrusted to his son <prn id='Q211488'>Antiochus</prn> all his empire in <prn id='Q48'>Asia</prn>, and himself proceeded rapidly towards <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl>, having with him an army both of Greeks and of foreigners. But <prn id='Q299387'>Ptolemy</prn>, brother of <prn id='Q289276'>Lysandra</prn>, had taken refuge with him from <prn id='Q32133'>Lysimachus</prn>; this man, an adventurous character named for this reason Keraunos (Thunderbolt), when the army of <prn id='Q184176'>Seleucus</prn> had advanced as far as <pl id='Q517690'>Lysimachia</pl>, assassinated <prn id='Q184176'>Seleucus</prn>, allowed the kings to seize his wealth, and ruled over <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl> until, being the first of the kings to my knowledge to dare to meet the Gauls in battle, he was killed by the foreigners. The empire was recovered by <prn id='Q241386'>Antigonus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q59734'>Demetrius</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.16.3'><b>1.16.3</b> I am persuaded that <prn id='Q184176'>Seleucus</prn> was the most righteous, and in particular the most religious of the kings. Firstly, it was <prn id='Q184176'>Seleucus</prn> who sent back to <pl id='Q671358'>Branchidae</pl> for the <pl id='Q169460'>Milesians</pl> the bronze <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> that had been carried by <prn id='Q129165'>Xerxes</prn> to <pl id='Q696193'>Ecbatana</pl> in <pl id='Q3746183'>Persia</pl>. Secondly, when he founded <pl id='Q1136681'>Seleucea</pl> on the river <pl id='Q35591'>Tigris</pl> and brought to it <pl id='Q5684'>Babylonian</pl> colonists he spared the wall of <pl id='Q5684'>Babylon</pl> as well as the sanctuary of <prn id='Q2894617'>Bel</prn>, near which he permitted the <prn id='Q200969'>Chaldeans</prn> to live. </p>
<p id='1.17.1'><b>1.17.1</b> In the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> <pl id='Q395367'>Agora</pl> among the objects not generally known is an altar to <prn id='Q364688'>Mercy</prn>, of all divinities the most useful in the life of mortals and in the vicissitudes of fortune, but honored by the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> alone among the Greeks. And they are conspicuous not only for their humanity but also for their devotion to religion. They have an altar to <prn id='Q404076'>Aidos</prn> (Shamefastness), one to <prn id='Q1120723'>Pheme</prn> (Rumor) and one to Orme (Effort). It is quite obvious that those who excel in piety are correspondingly rewarded by good fortune. </p>
<p id='1.17.2'><b>1.17.2</b> In the <pl id='Q24204093'>gymnasium</pl> not far from the <pl id='Q395367'>Agora</pl>, called <prn id='Q39576'>Ptolemy</prn>'s from the founder, are stone Hermae well worth seeing and a likeness in bronze of <prn id='Q39576'>Ptolemy</prn>. Here also is <prn id='Q315670'>Juba</prn> the Libyan and <prn id='Q211411'>Chrysippus</prn> of <pl id='Q656954'>Soli</pl>. Hard by the <pl id='Q24204093'>gymnasium</pl> is a <pl id='Q36024284'>sanctuary</pl> of <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>, where are pictures of <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> fighting <prn id='Q134154'>Amazons</prn>. This war they have also represented on the shield of their <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> and upon the pedestal of the <pl id='Q1123019'>Olympian Zeus</pl>. In the <pl id='Q36024284'>sanctuary</pl> of <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> is also a painting of the battle between the <prn id='Q83203'>Centaurs</prn> and the <prn id='Q334794'>Lapithae</prn>. <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> has already killed a <prn id='Q83203'>Centaur</prn>, but elsewhere the fighting is still undecided. </p>
<p id='1.17.3'><b>1.17.3</b> The painting on the third wall is not intelligible to those unfamiliar with the traditions, partly through age and partly because <prn id='Q1387790'>Micon</prn> has not represented in the picture the whole of the legend. When <prn id='Q23168'>Minos</prn> was taking <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> and the rest of the company of young folk to <pl id='Q4752820'>Crete</pl> he fell in love with <prn id='Q1295435'>Periboea</prn>, and on meeting with determined opposition from <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>, hurled insults at him and denied that he was a son of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, since he could not recover for him the signet-ring, which he happened to be wearing, if he threw it into the sea. With these words <prn id='Q23168'>Minos</prn> is said to have thrown the ring, but they say that <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> came up from the sea with that ring and also with a gold crown that <prn id='Q180222'>Amphitrite</prn> gave him. </p>
<p id='1.17.4'><b>1.17.4</b> The accounts of the end of <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> are many and inconsistent. They say he was kept a prisoner until <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> restored him to the light of day, but the most plausible account I have heard is this. <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> invaded <pl id='Q2551754'>Thesprotia</pl> to carry off the wife of the <pl id='Q2551754'>Thesprotian</pl> king, and in this way lost the greater part of his army, and both he and <prn id='Q502156'>Peirithous</prn> (he too was taking part in the expedition, being eager for the marriage) were taken captive. The <pl id='Q2551754'>Thesprotian</pl> king kept them prisoners at <pl id='Q1346887'>Cichyrus</pl>. </p>
<p id='1.17.5'><b>1.17.5</b> Among the sights of <pl id='Q2551754'>Thesprotia</pl> are a sanctuary of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> at <pl id='Q382317'>Dodona</pl> and an oak sacred to the god. Near <pl id='Q1346887'>Cichyrus</pl> is a lake called Acherusia, and a river called <pl id='Q191087'>Acheron</pl>. There is also <prn id='Q20379624'>Cocytus</prn>, a most unlovely stream. I believe it was because <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> had seen these places that he made bold to describe in his poems the regions of <prn id='Q41410'>Hades</prn>, and gave to the rivers there the names of those in <pl id='Q2551754'>Thesprotia</pl>. While <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> was thus kept in bonds, the sons of <prn id='Q192946'>Tyndareus</prn> marched against <pl id='Q618453'>Aphidna</pl>, captured it and restored <prn id='Q781867'>Menestheus</prn> to the kingdom. </p>
<p id='1.17.6'><b>1.17.6</b> Now <prn id='Q781867'>Menestheus</prn> took no account of the children of <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>, who had secretly withdrawn to <prn id='Q1328257'>Elephenor</prn> in <pl id='Q173096'>Euboea</pl>, but he was aware that <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>, if ever he returned from <pl id='Q2551754'>Thesprotia</pl>, would be a doughty antagonist, and so curried favour with his subjects that <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> on recovering afterwards his liberty was expelled. So <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> set out to <prn id='Q904515'>Deucalion</prn> in <pl id='Q4752820'>Crete</pl>. Being carried out of his course by winds to the island of <pl id='Q208566'>Scyros</pl> he was treated with marked honor by the inhabitants, both for the fame of his family and for the reputation of his own achievements. Accordingly <prn id='Q1330532'>Lycomedes</prn> contrived his death. His <pl id='Q36024284'>shrine</pl> was built at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> after the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl> landed at <pl id='Q31900'>Marathon</pl>, when <prn id='Q218102'>Cimon</prn>, son of <prn id='Q210350'>Miltiades</prn>, ravaged <pl id='Q208566'>Scyros</pl>, thus avenging <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>' death, and carried his bones to <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>. </p>
<p id='1.18.1'><b>1.18.1</b> The <pl id='Q484363'>sanctuary</pl> of the <prn id='Q190103'>Dioscuri</prn> is ancient.

<p id='1.18.2'><b>1.18.2</b> Above the <pl id='Q484363'>sanctuary</pl> of the <prn id='Q190103'>Dioscuri</prn> is a <pl id='Q394211'>sacred enclosure</pl> of <prn id='Q584492'>Aglaurus</prn>.

Here it was that the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl> climbed and killed the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> who thought that they understood the oracle better than did <prn id='Q179552'>Themistocles</prn>, and fortified the <pl id='Q131013'>Acropolis</pl> with logs and stakes. </p>
<p id='1.18.3'><b>1.18.3</b> Hard by is the <pl id='Q20616418'>Prytaneum</pl> (Town-hall), in which the laws of <prn id='Q133337'>Solon</prn> are inscribed, and figures are placed of the goddesses <prn id='Q214987'>Peace</prn> and <prn id='Q41419'>Hestia</prn> (Hearth), while among the statues is <prn id='Q787080'>Autolycus</prn> the pancratiast.

<p id='1.18.4'><b>1.18.4</b> As you descend from here to the lower part of the city, is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q214554'>Serapis</prn>, whose worship the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> introduced from <prn id='Q39576'>Ptolemy</prn>. Of the <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptian</pl> sanctuaries of <prn id='Q214554'>Serapis</prn> the most famous is at <pl id='Q87'>Alexandria</pl>, the oldest at <pl id='Q5715'>Memphis</pl>. Into this neither stranger nor priest may enter, until they bury <prn id='Q208150'>Apis</prn>. Not far from the sanctuary of <prn id='Q214554'>Serapis</prn> is the place where they say that <prn id='Q502156'>Peirithous</prn> and <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> made their pact before setting forth to <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl> and afterwards to <pl id='Q2551754'>Thesprotia</pl>. </p>
<p id='1.18.5'><b>1.18.5</b> Hard by is built a temple of <prn id='Q94066'>Eileithyia</prn>, who they say came from the <prn id='Q12871715'>Hyperboreans</prn> to <pl id='Q106802906'>Delos</pl> and helped <prn id='Q103107'>Leto</prn> in her labour; and from <pl id='Q173148'>Delos</pl> the name spread to other peoples. The <pl id='Q173148'>Delians</pl> sacrifice to <prn id='Q94066'>Eileithyia</prn> and sing a hymn of <prn id='Q978308'>Olen</prn>.

Only among the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> are the <prn id='Q693222'>xoana</prn> of <prn id='Q94066'>Eileithyia</prn> draped to the feet.

<p id='1.18.6'><b>1.18.6</b> Before the entrance to the <pl id='Q1123019'>sanctuary of Olympian Zeus</pl> — <prn id='Q1427'>Hadrian</prn> the Roman emperor dedicated the temple and the statue, one worth seeing, which in size exceeds all other statues save the colossi at <pl id='Q13533316'>Rhodes</pl> and <pl id='Q18287233'>Rome</pl>, and is made of ivory and gold with an artistic skill which is remarkable when the size is taken into account — before the entrance, I say, stand statues of <prn id='Q1427'>Hadrian</prn>, two of <pl id='Q2409204'>Thasian</pl> stone, two of <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptian</pl>. Before the pillars stand bronze statues which the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> call “colonies.” The whole circumference of the precincts is about four stades, and they are full of statues; for every city has dedicated a likeness of the emperor <prn id='Q1427'>Hadrian</prn>, and the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> have surpassed them in dedicating, behind the temple, the remarkable colossus. </p>
<p id='1.18.7'><b>1.18.7</b> Within the precincts are antiquities: a bronze <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, a <pl id='Q65238154'>temple</pl> of <prn id='Q44204'>Cronus</prn> and <prn id='Q108419'>Rhea</prn> and an enclosure of <prn id='Q93172'>Earth</prn> surnamed <prn id='Q106460486'>Olympian</prn>. Here the floor opens to the width of a cubit, and they say that along this bed flowed off the water after the deluge that occurred in the time of <prn id='Q207715'>Deucalion</prn>, and into it they cast every year wheat meal mixed with honey. </p>
<p id='1.18.8'><b>1.18.8</b> On a pillar is a statue of <prn id='Q221182'>Isocrates</prn>, whose memory is remarkable for three things: his diligence in continuing to teach to the end of his ninety-eight years, his self-restraint in keeping aloof from politics and from interfering with public affairs, and his love of liberty in dying a voluntary death, distressed at the news of the battle at <pl id='Q13574678'>Chaeronea</pl>. There are also statues in <pl id='Q32579'>Phrygian</pl> marble of <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl> supporting a bronze tripod; both the figures and the tripod are worth seeing. The ancient sanctuary of <pl id='Q1123019'>Olympian Zeus</pl> the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> say was built by <prn id='Q207715'>Deucalion</prn>, and they cite as evidence that <prn id='Q207715'>Deucalion</prn> lived at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> a grave which is not far from the present temple. </p>
<p id='1.18.9'><b>1.18.9</b> <prn id='Q1427'>Hadrian</prn> constructed other buildings also for the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>: a <prn id='Q65242064'>temple</prn> of <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> and <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q107315999'>Panhellenios</prn>, and a shared sanctuary for all the gods, and, most famous of all, a hundred pillars of <pl id='Q32579'>Phrygian</pl> marble [<place id='380237BHli'>Hadrian's library</place>]. The walls too are constructed of the same material as the cloisters. And there are rooms there adorned with a gilded roof and with alabaster stone, as well as with statues and paintings. In them are kept books. There is also a gymnasium named after <prn id='Q1427'>Hadrian</prn>; of this too the pillars are a hundred in number from the Libyan quarries. </p>
<p id='1.19.1'><b>1.19.1</b> Close to the <pl id='Q1123019'>temple of Olympian Zeus</pl> is a statue of the <prn id='Q107189402'>Pythian</prn> <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>. There is another <pl id='Q97206898'>sanctuary</pl> of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> surnamed <prn id='Q59695777'>Delphinius</prn>. The story has it that when the temple was finished with the exception of the roof, <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> arrived in the city, a stranger as yet to everybody. When he came to the <pl id='Q97206898'>temple</pl> of the Delphinian, wearing a tunic that reached to his feet and with his hair neatly plaited, those who were building the roof mockingly inquired what a marriageable virgin was doing wandering about by herself. The only answer that <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> made was to loose, it is said, the <prn id='Q473194'>oxen</prn> from the cart hard by, and to throw them higher than the roof of the temple they were building. </p>
<p id='1.19.2'><b>1.19.2</b> Concerning the district called Kepoi (Gardens), and the temple of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>, there is no story that is told by them, nor yet about the <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> which stands near the temple. Now the shape of it is square, like that of the Hermae, and the inscription declares that the <prn id='Q35500'>Heavenly Aphrodite</prn> is the oldest of those called <prn id='Q180287'>Fates</prn>. But the statue of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> in the Gardens is the work of <prn id='Q505640'>Alcamenes</prn>, and one of the most noteworthy things in <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>. </p>
<p id='1.19.3'><b>1.19.3</b> There is also the place called <pl id='Q940907'>Cynosarges</pl>, sacred to <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>; the story of the white <prn id='Q144'>dog</prn> may be known by reading the oracle. There are altars of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> and <prn id='Q131125'>Hebe</prn>, who they think is the daughter of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> and wife to <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>. An altar has been built to <prn id='Q190543'>Alcmena</prn> and to <prn id='Q504076'>Iolaus</prn>, who shared with <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> most of his labours. The <pl id='Q1160664'>Lyceum</pl> has its name from <prn id='Q1200671'>Lycus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q1076578'>Pandion</prn>, but it was considered sacred to <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> from the beginning down to my time, and here was the god first named <prn id='Q107349739'>Lyceius</prn>. There is a legend that the <prn id='Q111670880'>Termilae</prn> also, to whom <prn id='Q1200671'>Lycus</prn> came when he fled from <prn id='Q191725'>Aegeus</prn>, were called Lycii after him. </p>
<p id='1.19.4'><b>1.19.4</b> Behind the <pl id='Q1160664'>Lyceum</pl> is a monument of <prn id='Q1136201'>Nisus</prn>, who was killed while king of <pl id='Q42307600'>Megara</pl> by <prn id='Q23168'>Minos</prn>, and the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> carried him here and buried him. About this <prn id='Q1136201'>Nisus</prn> there is a legend. His hair, they say, was red, and it was fated that he should die on its being cut off. When the <pl id='Q4752820'>Cretans</pl> attacked the country, they captured the other cities of the <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarid</pl> by assault, but <pl id='Q2537089'>Nisaea</pl>, in which <prn id='Q1136201'>Nisus</prn> had taken refuge, they beleaguered. The story says how the daughter of <prn id='Q1136201'>Nisus</prn>, falling in love here with <prn id='Q23168'>Minos</prn>, cut off her father's hair. </p>
<p id='1.19.5'><b>1.19.5</b> Such is the legend. The rivers that flow through <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> territory are the <pl id='Q1658567'>Ilisus</pl> and its tributary the <pl id='Q1353735'>Eridanus</pl>, whose name is the same as that of the <pl id='Q35966'>Celtic</pl> river. This <pl id='Q1658567'>Ilisus</pl> is the river by which <prn id='Q1129489'>Oreithyia</prn> was playing when, according to the story, she was carried off by the <prn id='Q109220'>North Wind</prn>. With <prn id='Q1129489'>Oreithyia</prn> he lived in wedlock, and because of the tie between him and the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> he helped them by destroying most of the foreigners' warships. The <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> hold that the <pl id='Q1658567'>Ilisus</pl> is sacred to other deities as well, and on its bank is an altar of the Ilisian <prn id='Q66016'>Muses</prn>. The place too is pointed out where the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesians</pl> killed <prn id='Q1052888'>Codrus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q1255043'>Melanthus</prn> and king of <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>. </p>
<p id='1.19.6'><b>1.19.6</b> Across the <pl id='Q1658567'>Ilisus</pl> is a district called <pl id='Q116311975'>Agrae</pl> and a <pl id='Q20084335'>temple</pl> of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> <prn id='Q1458788'>Agrotera</prn> (the Huntress). They say that <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> first hunted here when she came from <pl id='Q173148'>Delos</pl>, and for this reason the statue carries a bow. A marvel to the eyes, though not so impressive to hear of, is a <pl id='Q208811'>race-course</pl> of white marble, the size of which can best be estimated from the fact that beginning in a crescent on the heights above the <pl id='Q1658567'>Ilisus</pl> it descends in two straight lines to the river bank. This was built by <prn id='Q311879'>Herodes</prn>, an <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl>, and the greater part of the <pl id='Q1125206'>Pentelic</pl> quarry was exhausted in its construction. </p>
<p id='1.20.1'><b>1.20.1</b> Leading from the <pl id='Q20616418'>Prytaneum</pl> is a road called <pl id='Q4306925'>Tripods</pl>. The place takes its name from the <pl id='Q1160691'>temples</pl>, which while large enough to hold the bronze tripods that stand upon them, contain very remarkable works of art, including a <prn id='Q163709'>Satyr</prn>, of which <prn id='Q105290'>Praxiteles</prn> is said to have been very proud. <prn id='Q232790'>Phryne</prn> once asked of him the most beautiful of his works, and the story goes that lover-like he agreed to give it, but refused to say which he thought the most beautiful. So a slave of <prn id='Q232790'>Phryne</prn> rushed in saying that a fire had broken out in the studio of <prn id='Q105290'>Praxiteles</prn>, and the greater number of his works were lost, though not all were destroyed. </p>
<p id='1.20.2'><b>1.20.2</b> <prn id='Q105290'>Praxiteles</prn> at once started to rush through the door crying that his labour was all wasted if indeed the flames had caught his <prn id='Q163709'>Satyr</prn> and his <prn id='Q121973'>Eros</prn>. But <prn id='Q232790'>Phryne</prn> bade him stay and be of good courage, for he had suffered no grievous loss, but had been trapped into confessing which were the most beautiful of his works. So <prn id='Q232790'>Phryne</prn> chose the statue of <prn id='Q121973'>Eros</prn>; while a <prn id='Q163709'>Satyr</prn> is in the <pl id='Q2032467'>temple</pl> of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> hard by, a boy holding out a cup. The <prn id='Q121973'>Eros</prn> standing with him and the <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> were made by <prn id='Q107323711'>Thymilus</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.20.3'><b>1.20.3</b> The oldest sanctuary of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> is near the <pl id='Q1227044'>theater</pl>. Within the precincts are two <pl id='Q2032467'>temples</pl> and two <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysuses</prn>, the <pl id='Q1328318'>Eleuthereus</pl> and the one <prn id='Q505640'>Alcamenes</prn> made of ivory and gold. There are paintings here — <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> bringing <prn id='Q44384'>Hephaestus</prn> up to heaven. One of the Greek legends is that <prn id='Q44384'>Hephaestus</prn>, when he was born, was thrown down by <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn>. In revenge he sent as a gift a golden chair with invisible fetters. When <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> sat down she was held fast, and <prn id='Q44384'>Hephaestus</prn> refused to listen to any other of the gods save <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> — in him he reposed the fullest trust — and after making him drunk <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> brought him to heaven. Besides this picture there are also represented <prn id='Q391091'>Pentheus</prn> and <prn id='Q270117'>Lycurgus</prn> paying the penalty of their insolence to <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>, <prn id='Q184874'>Ariadne</prn> asleep, <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> putting out to sea, and <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> on his arrival to carry off <prn id='Q184874'>Ariadne</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.20.4'><b>1.20.4</b> Near the sanctuary of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> and the <pl id='Q1227044'>theater</pl> is a <pl id='Q2704249'>structure</pl>, which is said to be a copy of <prn id='Q129165'>Xerxes</prn>' tent. It has been rebuilt, for the old building was burnt by the Roman general <prn id='Q483783'>Sulla</prn> when he took <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>. The cause of the war was this. <prn id='Q185126'>Mithridates</prn> was king over the foreigners around the <pl id='Q621672'>Euxine</pl>. Now the grounds on which he made war against the Romans, how he crossed into <prn id='Q48'>Asia</prn>, and the cities he took by force of arms or made his friends, I must leave for those to find out who wish to know the history of <prn id='Q185126'>Mithridates</prn>, and I shall confine my narrative to the capture of <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>. </p>
<p id='1.20.5'><b>1.20.5</b> There was an <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl>, <prn id='Q2861408'>Aristion</prn>, whom <prn id='Q185126'>Mithridates</prn> employed as his envoy to the Greek cities. He induced the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> to join <prn id='Q185126'>Mithridates</prn> rather than the Romans, although he did not induce all, but only the lower orders, and only the turbulent among them. The respectable <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> fled to the Romans of their own accord. In the engagement that ensued the Romans won a decisive victory; <prn id='Q2861408'>Aristion</prn> and the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> they drove in flight into the city, <prn id='Q360787'>Archelaus</prn> and the foreigners into the <pl id='Q13426467'>Peiraeus</pl>. This <prn id='Q360787'>Archelaus</prn> was another general of <prn id='Q185126'>Mithridates</prn>, whom earlier than this the <pl id='Q920866'>Magnetes</pl>, who inhabit <pl id='Q532698'>Sipylus</pl>, wounded when he raided their territory, killing most of the foreigners as well. So <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> was invested. </p>
<p id='1.20.6'><b>1.20.6</b> <prn id='Q2460883'>Taxilus</prn>, a general of <prn id='Q185126'>Mithridates</prn>, was at the time besieging <pl id='Q1235347'>Elatea</pl> in <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl>, but on receiving the news he withdrew his troops towards <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl>. Learning this, the Roman general entrusted the siege of <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> to a portion of his army, and with the greater part of his forces advanced in person to meet <prn id='Q2460883'>Taxilus</prn> in <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl>. On the third day from this, news came to both the Roman armies; <prn id='Q483783'>Sulla</prn> heard that the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> fortifications had been stormed, and the besieging force learnt that <prn id='Q2460883'>Taxilus</prn> had been defeated in battle near <pl id='Q13574678'>Chaeronea</pl>. When <prn id='Q483783'>Sulla</prn> returned to <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl> he imprisoned in the <pl id='Q630974'>Cerameicus</pl> the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> who had opposed him, and one chosen by lot out of every ten he ordered to be led to execution. </p>
<p id='1.20.7'><b>1.20.7</b> <prn id='Q483783'>Sulla</prn> abated nothing of his wrath against the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, and so a few effected an escape to <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>, and asked if the time were now come when it was fated for <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> also to be made desolate, receiving from the <prn id='Q220344'>Pythia</prn> the response about the wine skin. Afterwards <prn id='Q483783'>Sulla</prn> was smitten with the disease which I learn attacked <prn id='Q311485'>Pherecydes</prn> the Syrian. Although <prn id='Q483783'>Sulla</prn>'s treatment of the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> people was so savage as to be unworthy of a Roman, I do not think that this was the cause of his calamity, but rather the vengeance of <prn id='Q106522431'>Hikesios</prn> (protector of suppliants), for he had dragged <prn id='Q2861408'>Aristion</prn> from the sanctuary of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, where he had taken refuge, and killed him. Such wise was <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> sorely afflicted by the war with <pl id='Q18287233'>Rome</pl>, but she flourished again when <prn id='Q1427'>Hadrian</prn> was emperor. </p>
<p id='1.21.1'><b>1.21.1</b> In the <pl id='Q1227044'>theater</pl> the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> have portrait statues of poets, both tragic and comic, but they are mostly of undistinguished persons. With the exception of <prn id='Q118992'>Menander</prn> no poet of comedy represented here won a reputation, but tragedy has two illustrious representatives, <prn id='Q48305'>Euripides</prn> and <prn id='Q7235'>Sophocles</prn>. There is a legend that after the death of <prn id='Q7235'>Sophocles</prn> the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> invaded <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl>, and their commander saw in a vision <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>, who bade him honor, with all the customary honors of the dead, the new <prn id='Q150986'>Siren</prn>. He interpreted the dream as referring to <prn id='Q7235'>Sophocles</prn> and his poetry, and down to the present day men are wont to liken to a <prn id='Q150986'>Siren</prn> whatever is charming in both poetry and prose. </p>
<p id='1.21.2'><b>1.21.2</b> The likeness of <prn id='Q40939'>Aeschylus</prn> is, I think, much later than his death and than the painting which depicts the action at <pl id='Q31900'>Marathon</pl> <prn id='Q40939'>Aeschylus</prn> himself said that when a youth he slept while watching grapes in a field, and that <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> appeared and bade him write tragedy. When day came, in obedience to the vision, he made an attempt and hereafter found composing quite easy. </p>
<p id='1.21.3'><b>1.21.3</b> Such were his words. On the South wall, as it is called, of the <pl id='Q131013'>Acropolis</pl>, which faces the <pl id='Q1227044'>theater</pl>, there is dedicated a gilded head of <prn id='Q160730'>Medusa</prn> the <prn id='Q102059'>Gorgon</prn>, and round it is wrought an aegis. At the top of the <pl id='Q1227044'>theater</pl> is a <pl id='Q2290491'>cave</pl> in the rocks under the <pl id='Q131013'>Acropolis</pl>. This also has a tripod over it, wherein are <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> and <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> slaying the children of <prn id='Q213621'>Niobe</prn>. This <prn id='Q213621'>Niobe</prn> I myself saw when I had gone up to Mount <pl id='Q532698'>Sipylus</pl>. When you are near it is a beetling crag, with not the slightest resemblance to a woman, mourning or otherwise; but if you go further away you will think you see a woman in tears, with head bowed down. </p>
<p id='1.21.4'><b>1.21.4</b> On the way to the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> <pl id='Q131013'>Acropolis</pl> from the <pl id='Q1227044'>theater</pl> is the tomb of <prn id='Q2365581'>Calos</prn>. <prn id='Q134756'>Daedalus</prn> murdered this <prn id='Q2365581'>Calos</prn>, who was his sister's son and a student of his craft, and therefore he fled to <pl id='Q4752820'>Crete</pl>; afterwards he escaped to <prn id='Q1559958'>Cocalus</prn> in <pl id='Q4951156'>Sicily</pl>. The <pl id='Q2278514'>sanctuary</pl> of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> is worth seeing both for its paintings and for the statues of the god and his children. In it there is a spring, by which they say that <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>'s son <prn id='Q592348'>Halirrhothius</prn> deflowered <prn id='Q1640434'>Alcippe</prn> the daughter of <prn id='Q40901'>Ares</prn>, who killed the ravisher and was the first to be put on his trial for the shedding of blood. </p>
<p id='1.21.5'><b>1.21.5</b> Among the votive offerings there is a <pl id='Q2528503'>Sauromatic</pl> breast plate. On seeing this a man will say that no less than Greeks are foreigners skilled in the arts. For the <pl id='Q2528503'>Sauromatae</pl> have no iron, neither mined by themselves nor yet imported. They have, in fact, no dealings at all with the foreigners around them. To meet this deficiency they have contrived inventions. In place of iron they use bone for their spear-blades, and cornel-wood for their bows and arrows, with bone points for the arrows. They throw a lasso round any enemy they meet, and then turning round their <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn> upset the enemy caught in the lasso. </p>
<p id='1.21.6'><b>1.21.6</b> Their breastplates they make in the following fashion. Each man keeps many mares, since the land is not divided into private allotments, nor does it bear any thing except wild trees, as the people are nomads. These mares they not only use for war, but also sacrifice them to the local gods and eat them for food. Their hoofs they collect, clean, split, and make from them as it were python scales. Whoever has never seen a python must at least have seen a pine-cone still green. He will not be mistaken if he liken the product from the hoof to the segments that are seen on the pine-cone. These pieces they bore and stitch together with the sinews of <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn> and <prn id='Q473194'>oxen</prn>, and then use them as breastplates that are as handsome and strong as those of the Greeks. For they can withstand blows of missiles and those struck in close combat. </p>
<p id='1.21.7'><b>1.21.7</b> Linen breastplates are not so useful to fighters, for they let the iron pass through, if the blow be a violent one. They aid hunters, how ever, for the teeth of <prn id='Q140'>lions</prn> or leopards break off in them. You may see linen breastplates dedicated in other sanctuaries, notably in that at <pl id='Q969347'>Gryneum</pl>, where there is a most beautiful grove of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, with cultivated trees, and all those which, although they bear no fruit, are pleasing to smell or look upon. </p>
<p id='1.22.1'><b>1.22.1</b> After the <pl id='Q2278514'>sanctuary of Asclepius</pl>, as you go by this way towards the <pl id='Q131013'>Acropolis</pl>, there is a temple of <prn id='Q159168'>Themis</prn>. Before it is raised a sepulchral mound to <prn id='Q338201'>Hippolytus</prn>. The end of his life, they say, came from curses. Everybody, even a foreigner who has learnt Greek, knows about the love of <prn id='Q212818'>Phaedra</prn> and the wickedness the nurse dared commit to serve her. The <pl id='Q581494'>Troezenians</pl> too have a grave of <prn id='Q338201'>Hippolytus</prn>, and their legend about it is this. </p>
<p id='1.22.2'><b>1.22.2</b> When <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> was about to marry <prn id='Q212818'>Phaedra</prn>, not wishing, should he have children, <prn id='Q338201'>Hippolytus</prn> either to be their subject or to be king in their stead, sent him to <prn id='Q750580'>Pittheus</prn> to be brought up and to be the future king of <pl id='Q581494'>Troezen</pl>. Afterwards <prn id='Q429306'>Pallas</prn> and his sons rebelled against <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>. After putting them to death he went to <pl id='Q581494'>Troezen</pl> for purification, and <prn id='Q212818'>Phaedra</prn> first saw <prn id='Q338201'>Hippolytus</prn> there. Falling in love with him she contrived the plot for his death. The <pl id='Q581494'>Troezenians</pl> have a myrtle with every one of its leaves pierced; they say that it did not grow originally in this fashion, the holes being due to <prn id='Q212818'>Phaedra</prn>'s disgust with love and to the pin which she wore in her hair. </p>
<p id='1.22.3'><b>1.22.3</b> When <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> had united into one state the many <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> demes, he established the <pl id='Q24204704'>cults</pl> of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> <prn id='Q4779733'>Pandemos</prn> and of <prn id='Q611171'>Peitho</prn> (Persuasion). The old statues no longer existed in my time, but those I saw were the work of no inferior artists. There is also a sanctuary of <prn id='Q93172'>Earth</prn> Kourotrophos, and of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> <prn id='Q105760663'>Chloe</prn> (Green). You can learn all about their names by conversing with the priests. </p>
<p id='1.22.4'><b>1.22.4</b> There is but one entry to the <pl id='Q131013'>Acropolis</pl>. It affords no other, being precipitous throughout and having a strong wall. The <pl id='Q3407649'>Propylaia</pl> has a roof of white marble, and down to the present day it is unrivalled for the beauty and size of its stones. Now as to the statues of the horsemen, I cannot tell for certain whether they are the sons of <prn id='Q129772'>Xenophon</prn> or whether they were made merely to beautify the place. On the right of the <pl id='Q3407649'>Propylaia</pl> is a <pl id='Q384813'>temple</pl> of <prn id='Q55404088'>Wingless</prn> <prn id='Q165023'>Nike</prn> (Victory). From this point the sea is visible, and here it was that, according to legend, <prn id='Q191725'>Aegeus</prn> threw himself down to his death. </p>
<p id='1.22.5'><b>1.22.5</b> For the ship that carried the young people to <pl id='Q4752820'>Crete</pl> began her voyage with black sails; but <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>, who was sailing on an adventure against the <prn id='Q129866'>bull</prn> of <prn id='Q23168'>Minos</prn>, as it is called, had told his father beforehand that he would use white sails if he should sail back victorious over the <prn id='Q693690'>bull</prn>. But the loss of <prn id='Q184874'>Ariadne</prn> made him forget the signal. Then <prn id='Q191725'>Aegeus</prn>, when from this eminence he saw the vessel borne by black sails, thinking that his son was dead, threw himself down to destruction. There is at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> a sanctuary dedicated to him, and called the hero-shrine of <prn id='Q191725'>Aegeus</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.22.6'><b>1.22.6</b> On the left of the <pl id='Q3407649'>Propylaia</pl> is a building with pictures. Among those not effaced by time I found <prn id='Q208256'>Diomedes</prn> taking the <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> from <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl>, and <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn> in <pl id='Q192483'>Lemnos</pl> taking away the bow of <prn id='Q212827'>Philoctetes</prn>. There in the pictures is <prn id='Q192407'>Orestes</prn> killing <prn id='Q212091'>Aegisthus</prn>, and <prn id='Q494886'>Pylades</prn> killing the sons of <prn id='Q833826'>Nauplius</prn> who had come to bring <prn id='Q212091'>Aegisthus</prn> succor. And there is <prn id='Q750236'>Polyxena</prn> about to be sacrificed near the grave of <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn>. <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> did well in passing by this barbarous act. I think too that he showed poetic insight in making <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn> capture <pl id='Q208566'>Scyros</pl>, differing entirely from those who say that <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn> lived in <pl id='Q208566'>Scyros</pl> with the maidens, as <prn id='Q182855'>Polygnotus</prn> has represented in his picture. He also painted <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn> coming upon the women washing clothes with <prn id='Q135224'>Nausicaa</prn> at the river, just like the description in <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>. There are other pictures, including a portrait of <prn id='Q187982'>Alcibiades</prn>, </p>
<p id='1.22.7'><b>1.22.7</b> and in the picture are emblems of the victory his <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn> won at <pl id='Q748108'>Nemea</pl>. There is also <prn id='Q130832'>Perseus</prn> journeying to <pl id='Q217214'>Seriphos</pl>, and carrying to <prn id='Q771241'>Polydectes</prn> the head of <prn id='Q160730'>Medusa</prn>, the legend about whom I am unwilling to relate in my description of <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl>. Included among the paintings — I omit the boy carrying the water-jars and the wrestler by <prn id='Q107324502'>Timaenetus</prn> — is <prn id='Q728059'>Musaeus</prn>. I have read verse in which <prn id='Q728059'>Musaeus</prn> receives from the <prn id='Q109220'>North Wind</prn> the gift of flight, but, in my opinion, <prn id='Q537647'>Onomacritus</prn> wrote them, and there are no certainly genuine works of <prn id='Q728059'>Musaeus</prn> except a hymn to <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> written for the <prn id='Q31789671'>Lycomidae</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.22.8'><b>1.22.8</b> Right at the very entrance to the <pl id='Q131013'>Acropolis</pl> are a <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> (called <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> of the <pl id='Q3407649'>Propylaia</pl>) and figures of <prn id='Q184353'>Graces</prn>, which tradition says were sculptured by <prn id='Q913'>Socrates</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q2303035'>Sophroniscus</prn>, who the <prn id='Q220344'>Pythia</prn> testified was the wisest of men, a title she refused to <prn id='Q325026'>Anacharsis</prn>, although he desired it and came to <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> to win it. </p>
<p id='1.23.1'><b>1.23.1</b> Among the sayings of the Greeks is one that there were seven wise men. Two of them were the despot of <pl id='Q128087'>Lesbos</pl> and <prn id='Q328793'>Periander</prn> the son of <prn id='Q430688'>Cypselus</prn>. And yet <prn id='Q242172'>Peisistratus</prn> and his son <prn id='Q210573'>Hippias</prn> were more humane than <prn id='Q328793'>Periander</prn>, wiser too in warfare and in statecraft, until, on account of the murder of <prn id='Q435531'>Hipparchus</prn>, <prn id='Q210573'>Hippias</prn> vented his passion against all and sundry, including a woman named <prn id='Q544528'>Leaena</prn> (Lioness). </p>
<p id='1.23.2'><b>1.23.2</b> What I am about to say has never before been committed to writing, but is generally credited among the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>. When <prn id='Q435531'>Hipparchus</prn> died, <prn id='Q210573'>Hippias</prn> tortured <prn id='Q544528'>Leaena</prn> to death, because he knew she was the mistress of <prn id='Q718117'>Aristogeiton</prn>, and therefore could not possibly, he held, be in ignorance of the plot. As a recompense, when the tyranny of the <prn id='Q2382657'>Peisistratidae</prn> was at an end, the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> put up a bronze lioness in memory of the woman, which they say <prn id='Q970958'>Callias</prn> dedicated and <prn id='Q918382'>Calamis</prn> made. </p>
<p id='1.23.3'><b>1.23.3</b> Hard by is a bronze statue of <prn id='Q1528083'>Diitrephes</prn> shot through by arrows. Among the acts reported of this <prn id='Q1528083'>Diitrephes</prn> by the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> is his leading back home the Thracian mercenaries who arrived too late to take part in the expedition of <prn id='Q504986'>Demosthenes</prn> against <pl id='Q4420718'>Syracuse</pl>. He also put into the Chalcidic <pl id='Q1137741'>Euripus</pl>, where the <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotians</pl> had an inland town <pl id='Q1529070'>Mycalessus</pl>, marched up to this town from the coast and took it. Of the inhabitants the <pl id='Q41741'>Thracians</pl> put to the sword not only the combatants but also the women and children. I have evidence to bring. All the <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotian</pl> towns which the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> sacked were inhabited in my time, as the people escaped just before the capture; so if the foreigners had not exterminated the <pl id='Q1529070'>Mycalessians</pl> the survivors would have afterwards reoccupied the town. </p>
<p id='1.23.4'><b>1.23.4</b> I was greatly surprised to see the statue of <prn id='Q1528083'>Diitrephes</prn> pierced with arrows, because the only Greeks whose custom it is to use that weapon are the <pl id='Q4752820'>Cretans</pl>. For the <pl id='Q3354839'>Opuntian Locrians</pl>, whom <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> represents as coming to <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl> with bows and slings, we know were armed as heavy infantry by the time of the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl> wars. Neither indeed did the <pl id='Q11934734'>Malians</pl> continue the practice of the bow; in fact, I believe that they did not know it before the time of <prn id='Q212827'>Philoctetes</prn>, and gave it up soon after. Near the statue of <prn id='Q1528083'>Diitrephes</prn> — I do not wish to write of the less distinguished portraits — are figures of gods; of <prn id='Q107306832'>Hygeia</prn> (health), whom legend calls daughter of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>, and of <pl id='Q107307241'>Athena</pl>, also surnamed <prn id='Q107306832'>Hygieia</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.23.5'><b>1.23.5</b> There is also a smallish stone, just large enough to serve as a seat to a little man. On it legend says <prn id='Q464091'>Silenus</prn> rested when <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> came to the land. The oldest of the <prn id='Q163709'>Satyrs</prn> they call <prn id='Q464091'>Sileni</prn>. Wishing to know better than most people who the <prn id='Q163709'>Satyrs</prn> are I have inquired from many about this very point. <prn id='Q749123'>Euphemus</prn> the <pl id='Q193214'>Carian</pl> said that on a voyage to <pl id='Q913582'>Italy</pl> he was driven out of his course by winds and was carried into the outer sea, beyond the course of seamen. He affirmed that there were many uninhabited islands, while in others lived wild men. The sailors did not wish to put in at the latter, </p>
<p id='1.23.6'><b>1.23.6</b> because, having put in before, they had some experience of the inhabitants, but on this occasion they had no choice in the matter. The islands were called Satyrides by the sailors, and the inhabitants were red haired, and had upon their flanks tails not much smaller than those of <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn>. As soon as they caught sight of their visitors, they ran down to the ship without uttering a cry and assaulted the women in the ship. At last the sailors in fear cast a foreign woman on to the island. Her the <prn id='Q163709'>Satyrs</prn> outraged not only in the usual way, but also in a most shocking manner. </p>
<p id='1.23.7'><b>1.23.7</b> I remember looking at other things also on the Athenian <pl id='Q131013'>Acropolis</pl>, a bronze boy holding the sprinkler, by <prn id='Q6707302'>Lycius</prn> son of <prn id='Q192211'>Myron</prn>, and <prn id='Q192211'>Myron</prn>'s <prn id='Q130832'>Perseus</prn> after beheading <prn id='Q160730'>Medusa</prn>. There is also a <pl id='Q902329'>sanctuary</pl> of <prn id='Q56152358'>Brauronian</prn> <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>; the image is the work of <prn id='Q105290'>Praxiteles</prn>, but the goddess derives her name from the deme of <pl id='Q475497'>Brauron</pl>. The old <prn id='Q693222'>xoanon</prn> is in <pl id='Q475497'>Brauron</pl>, the <pl id='Q7835'>Tauric</pl> <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> as she is called. </p>
<p id='1.23.8'><b>1.23.8</b> There is the <prn id='Q50193'>horse called Wooden</prn> set up in bronze. That the work of <prn id='Q278930'>Epeius</prn> was a contrivance to make a breach in the <pl id='Q22647'>Trojan</pl> wall is known to everybody who does not attribute utter silliness to the <pl id='Q32579'>Phrygians</pl>. But legend says of that <prn id='Q50193'>horse</prn> that it contained the most valiant of the Greeks, and the design of the bronze figure fits in well with this story. <prn id='Q781867'>Menestheus</prn> and <prn id='Q878184'>Teucer</prn> are peeping out of it, and so are the sons of <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.23.9'><b>1.23.9</b> Of the statues that stand after the <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn>, the likeness of <prn id='Q107324908'>Epicharinus</prn> who practised the race in armour was made by <prn id='Q1186159'>Critius</prn>, while <prn id='Q114317442'>Oenobius</prn> performed a kind service for <prn id='Q41683'>Thucydides</prn> the son of OloruYY. He succeeded in getting a decree passed for the return of <prn id='Q41683'>Thucydides</prn> to <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, who was treacherously murdered as he was returning, and there is a monument to him not far from the <pl id='Q116334786'>Melitid gate</pl>. </p>
<p id='1.23.10'><b>1.23.10</b> The stories of <prn id='Q11925504'>Hermolycus</prn> the pancratiast and <prn id='Q2338787'>Phormio</prn> the son of <prn id='Q123190357'>Asopichus</prn> I omit, as others have told them. About <prn id='Q2338787'>Phormio</prn>, however, I have a detail to add. Quite one of the best men at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> and distinguished for the fame of his ancestors he chanced to be heavily in debt. So he withdrew to the deme <pl id='Q18015501'>Paeania</pl> and lived there until the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> elected him to command a naval expedition. But he refused the office on the ground that before his debts were discharged he lacked the spirit to face his troops. So the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, who were absolutely determined to have <prn id='Q2338787'>Phormio</prn> as their commander, paid all his creditors. </p>
<p id='1.24.1'><b>1.24.1</b> In this place is a statue of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> striking <prn id='Q599737'>Marsyas</prn> the <prn id='Q464091'>Silenus</prn> for taking up the flutes that the goddess wished to be cast away for good. Opposite these I have mentioned is represented the fight which legend says <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> fought with the so-called <prn id='Q129866'>Bull</prn> of <prn id='Q23168'>Minos</prn>, whether this was a man or a beast of the nature he is said to have been in the accepted story. For even in our time women have given birth to far more extraordinary monsters than this. </p>
<p id='1.24.2'><b>1.24.2</b> There is also a statue of <prn id='Q743482'>Phrixus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q143880'>Athamas</prn> carried ashore to the <pl id='Q183150'>Colchians</pl> by the ram. Having sacrificed the animal to some god or other, presumably to the one called by the <pl id='Q543895'>Orchomenians</pl> <prn id='Q107349743'>Laphystius</prn>, he has cut out the thighs in accordance with Greek custom and is watching them as they burn. Next come other statues, including one of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> strangling the <prn id='Q2102'>serpents</prn> as the legend describes. There is <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> too coming up out of the head of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, and also a <prn id='Q693690'>bull</prn> dedicated by the Council of the <pl id='Q202487'>Areopagus</pl> on some occasion or other, about which, if one cared, one could make many conjectures. </p>
<p id='1.24.3'><b>1.24.3</b> I have already stated that the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> are far more devoted to religion than other men. They were the first to surname <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> <prn id='Q1350313'>Ergane</prn> (Worker); they were the first to set up limbless <prn id='Q376693'>Hermae</prn>, and the temple ... is shared by the daimon of Good men. Those who prefer artistic workmanship to mere antiquity may look at the following: a man wearing a helmet, by <prn id='Q88464846'>Cleoetas</prn>, whose nails the artist has made of silver, and an image of <prn id='Q93172'>Earth</prn> beseeching <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> to rain upon her; perhaps the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> themselves needed showers, or may be all the Greeks had been plagued with a drought. There also are set up <prn id='Q713679'>Timotheus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q363832'>Conon</prn> and <prn id='Q363832'>Conon</prn> himself; <prn id='Q1231743'>Procne</prn> too, who has already made up her mind about the boy, and <prn id='Q1675360'>Itys</prn> as well — a group dedicated by <prn id='Q505640'>Alcamenes</prn>. <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> is represented displaying the olive plant, and <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> the wave, </p>
<p id='1.24.4'><b>1.24.4</b> and there are statues of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, one made by <prn id='Q323430'>Leochares</prn> and one called <prn id='Q107349746'>Polieus</prn> (of the polis), the customary mode of sacrificing to whom I will give without adding the traditional reason thereof. Upon the <pl id='Q1595395'>altar</pl> of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q107349746'>Polieus</prn> they place barley mixed with wheat and leave it unguarded. The <prn id='Q473194'>ox</prn>, which they keep already prepared for sacrifice, goes to the altar and partakes of the grain. One of the priests they call the <prn id='Q473194'>ox</prn>-slayer, who kills the <prn id='Q473194'>ox</prn> and then, casting aside the axe here according to the ritual runs away. The others bring the axe to trial, as though they know not the man who did the deed. </p>
<p id='1.24.5'><b>1.24.5</b> Their ritual, then, is such as I have described. As you enter the temple that they name the <pl id='Q10288'>Parthenon</pl>, all the sculptures you see on what is called the pediment refer to the birth of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, those on the rear pediment represent the contest for the land between <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> and <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>. The <prn id='Q2070605'>agalma</prn> itself is made of ivory and gold. On the middle of her helmet is placed a likeness of the <prn id='Q151480'>Sphinx</prn> — the tale of the <prn id='Q9335858'>Sphinx</prn> I will give when I come to my description of <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl> — and on either side of the helmet are griffins in relief. </p>
<p id='1.24.6'><b>1.24.6</b> These griffins, <prn id='Q520917'>Aristeas</prn> of <pl id='Q950908'>Proconnesus</pl> says in his poem, fight for the gold with the <prn id='Q661584'>Arimaspi</prn> beyond the <prn id='Q1079061'>Issedones</prn>. The gold which the griffins guard, he says, comes out of the earth; the <prn id='Q661584'>Arimaspi</prn> are men all born with one eye; griffins are beasts like <prn id='Q140'>lions</prn>, but with the beak and wings of an <prn id='Q2092297'>eagle</prn>. I will say no more about the griffins. </p>
<p id='1.24.7'><b>1.24.7</b> The <prn id='Q2070605'>agalma</prn> of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> is upright, with a tunic reaching to the feet, and on her breast the head of <prn id='Q160730'>Medusa</prn> is worked in ivory. She holds a statue of <prn id='Q165023'>Victory</prn> about four cubits high, and in the other hand a spear; at her feet lies a shield and near the spear is a <prn id='Q2102'>serpent</prn>. This <prn id='Q2102'>serpent</prn> would be <prn id='Q644921'>Erichthonius</prn>. On the pedestal is the birth of <prn id='Q131346'>Pandora</prn> in relief. <prn id='Q44233'>Hesiod</prn> and others have sung how this <prn id='Q131346'>Pandora</prn> was the first woman; before <prn id='Q131346'>Pandora</prn> was born there was as yet no womankind. The only portrait statue (eikon) I remember seeing here is one of the emperor <prn id='Q1427'>Hadrian</prn>, and at the entrance one of <prn id='Q354424'>Iphicrates</prn>, who accomplished many remarkable achievements. </p>
<p id='1.24.8'><b>1.24.8</b> Opposite the <pl id='Q10288'>temple</pl> is a bronze <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, said to be the work of <prn id='Q177302'>Pheidias</prn>. They call it Parnopion (Locust), because once when locusts were devastating the land the god said that he would drive them from <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl>. That he did drive them away they know, but they do not say how. I myself know that locusts have been destroyed three times in the past on Mount <pl id='Q532698'>Sipylus</pl>, and not in the same way. Once a gale arose and swept them away; on another occasion violent heat came on after rain and destroyed them; the third time sudden cold caught them and they died. </p>
<p id='1.25.1'><b>1.25.1</b> Such were the fates I saw befall the locusts. On the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> <pl id='Q131013'>Acropolis</pl> is a statue of <prn id='Q80398'>Pericles</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q380401'>Xanthippus</prn>, and one of <prn id='Q380401'>Xanthippus</prn> himself, who fought against the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl> at the naval battle of <pl id='Q1330828'>Mycale</pl>. But that of <prn id='Q80398'>Pericles</prn> stands apart, while near <prn id='Q380401'>Xanthippus</prn> stands <prn id='Q213484'>Anacreon</prn> of <pl id='Q17586'>Teos</pl>, the first poet after <prn id='Q17892'>Sappho</prn> of <pl id='Q128087'>Lesbos</pl> to devote himself to love songs, and his posture is as it were that of a man singing when he is drunk. <prn id='Q28556208'>Deinomenes</prn> made the two female figures which stand near, <prn id='Q179014'>Io</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q735623'>Inachus</prn>, and <prn id='Q203673'>Callisto</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q501667'>Lycaon</prn>, of both of whom exactly the same story is told, to wit, love of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, wrath of <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn>, and metamorphosis, <prn id='Q179014'>Io</prn> becoming a <prn id='Q830'>cow</prn> and <prn id='Q203673'>Callisto</prn> a bear. </p>
<p id='1.25.2'><b>1.25.2</b> By the south wall are represented the legendary war with the giants, who once dwelt about <pl id='Q41741'>Thrace</pl> and on the isthmus of <pl id='Q2625955'>Pallene</pl>, the battle between the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> and the <prn id='Q134154'>Amazons</prn>, the engagement with the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl> at <pl id='Q31900'>Marathon</pl> and the destruction of the Gauls in <pl id='Q622319'>Mysia</pl>. Each is about two cubits, and all were dedicated by <prn id='Q110745'>Attalus</prn>. There stands too <prn id='Q1659401'>Olympiodorus</prn>, who won fame for the greatness of his achievements, especially in the crisis when he displayed a brave confidence among men who had met with continuous reverses, and were therefore in despair of winning a single success in the days to come. </p>
<p id='1.25.3'><b>1.25.3</b> For the disaster at <pl id='Q13574678'>Chaeronea</pl> was the beginning of misfortune for all the Greeks, and especially did it enslave those who had been blind to the danger and such as had sided with <pl id='Q81734'>Macedon</pl>. Most of their cities <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn> captured; with <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> he nominally came to terms, but really imposed the severest penalties upon her, taking away the islands and putting an end to her maritime empire. For a time the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> remained passive, during the reign of <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn> and subsequently of <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn>. But when on the death of <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn> the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> chose <prn id='Q295530'>Aridaeus</prn> to be their king, though the whole empire had been entrusted to <prn id='Q204760'>Antipater</prn>, the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> now thought it intolerable if Greece should be for ever under the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl>, and themselves embarked on war besides inciting others to join them. </p>
<p id='1.25.4'><b>1.25.4</b> The cities that took part were, of the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesians</pl>, <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>, <pl id='Q233576'>Epidaurus</pl>, <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl>, <pl id='Q581494'>Troezen</pl>, the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>, the <pl id='Q1412043'>Phliasians</pl>, <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl>; on the other side of the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthian</pl> isthmus the <pl id='Q4894785'>Locrians</pl>, the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl>, the <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessalians</pl>, <pl id='Q13554032'>Carystus</pl>, the <pl id='Q416070'>Acarnanians</pl> belonging to the <prn id='Q245273'>Aetolian League</prn>. The <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotians</pl>, who occupied the <pl id='Q768515'>Thebaid</pl> territory now that there were no <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> left to dwell there, in fear lest the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> should injure them by founding a settlement on the site of <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>, refused to join the alliance and lent all their forces to furthering the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonian</pl> cause. </p>
<p id='1.25.5'><b>1.25.5</b> Each city ranged under the alliance had its own general, but as commander-in-chief was chosen the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> <prn id='Q183109'>Leosthenes</prn>, both because of the fame of his city and also because he had the reputation of being an experienced soldier. He had already proved himself a general benefactor of Greece. All the Greeks that were serving as mercenaries in the armies of <prn id='Q102865'>Darius</prn> and his satraps <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn> had wished to deport to <pl id='Q3746183'>Persia</pl>, but <prn id='Q183109'>Leosthenes</prn> was too quick for him, and brought them by sea to Europe. On this occasion too his brilliant actions surpassed expectation, and his death produced a general despair which was chiefly responsible for the defeat. A <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonian</pl> garrison was set over the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, and occupied first <pl id='Q1611219'>Munychia</pl> and afterwards <pl id='Q13426467'>Peiraeus</pl> also and the <pl id='Q1163616'>Long Walls</pl>. </p>
<p id='1.25.6'><b>1.25.6</b> On the death of <prn id='Q204760'>Antipater</prn> <prn id='Q223134'>Olympias</prn> came over from <pl id='Q565751'>Epeirus</pl>, killed <prn id='Q295530'>Aridaeus</prn>, and for a time occupied the throne; but shortly afterwards she was besieged by <prn id='Q207183'>Cassander</prn>, taken and delivered up to the people. Of the acts of <prn id='Q207183'>Cassander</prn> when he came to the throne my narrative will deal only with such as concern the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>. He seized the fort of <pl id='Q12882434'>Panactum</pl> in <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl> and also <pl id='Q202422'>Salamis</pl>, and established as tyrant in <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> <prn id='Q313286'>Demetrius</prn> the son of PhanostraYY, a man who had won a reputation for wisdom. This tyrant was put down by <prn id='Q59734'>Demetrius</prn> the son of <prn id='Q200401'>Antigonus</prn>, a young man of strong Greek sympathies. </p>
<p id='1.25.7'><b>1.25.7</b> But <prn id='Q207183'>Cassander</prn>, inspired by a deep hatred of the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, made a friend of <prn id='Q1241666'>Lachares</prn>, who up to now had been the popular champion, and induced him also to arrange a tyranny. We know no tyrant who proved so cruel to man and so impious to the gods. Although <prn id='Q59734'>Demetrius</prn> the son of <prn id='Q200401'>Antigonus</prn> was now at variance with the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> people, he notwithstanding deposed <prn id='Q1241666'>Lachares</prn> too from his tyranny, who, on the capture of the fortifications, escaped to <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl>. <prn id='Q1241666'>Lachares</prn> took golden shields from the <pl id='Q131013'>Acropolis</pl>, and stripped even the statue of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> of its removable ornament; he was accordingly suspected of being a very wealthy man, </p>
<p id='1.25.8'><b>1.25.8</b> and was murdered by some men of <pl id='Q593295'>Coronea</pl> for the sake of this wealth. After freeing the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> from tyrants <prn id='Q59734'>Demetrius</prn> the son of <prn id='Q200401'>Antigonus</prn> did not restore the <pl id='Q13426467'>Peiraeus</pl> to them immediately after the flight of <prn id='Q1241666'>Lachares</prn>, but subsequently overcame them and brought a garrison even into the upper city, fortifying the place called the <pl id='Q2088161'>Museum</pl>. This is a hill right opposite the <pl id='Q131013'>Acropolis</pl> within the old city boundaries, where legend says <prn id='Q728059'>Musaeus</prn> used to sing, and, dying of old age, was <pl id='Q116312237'>buried</pl>. Afterwards a <pl id='Q1760491'>monument</pl> also was erected here to a Syrian. At the time to which I refer <prn id='Q59734'>Demetrius</prn> fortified and held it. </p>
<p id='1.26.1'><b>1.26.1</b> But afterwards a few men called to mind their forefathers, and the contrast between their present position and the ancient glory of <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, and without more ado forth with elected <prn id='Q1659401'>Olympiodorus</prn> to be their general. He led them against the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl>, both the old men and the youths, and trusted for military success more to enthusiasm than to strength. The <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> came out to meet him, but he overcame them, pursued them to the <pl id='Q116312237'>Museum</pl>, and captured the position. </p>
<p id='1.26.2'><b>1.26.2</b> So <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> was delivered from the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl>, and though all the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> fought memorably, <prn id='Q11931836'>Leocritus</prn> the son of ProtarchuYY is said to have displayed most daring in the engagement. For he was the first to scale the fortification, and the first to rush into the <pl id='Q116312237'>Museum</pl>; and when he fell fighting, the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> did him great honor, dedicating his shield to <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> of Freedom (<prn id='Q106542644'>Eleutherios</prn>) and in scribing on it the name of <prn id='Q11931836'>Leocritus</prn> and his exploit. </p>
<p id='1.26.3'><b>1.26.3</b> This is the greatest achievement of <prn id='Q1659401'>Olympiodorus</prn>, not to mention his success in recovering <pl id='Q13426467'>Peiraeus</pl> and <pl id='Q1611219'>Munychia</pl>; and again, when the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> were raiding <pl id='Q11918833'>Eleusis</pl> he collected a force of <pl id='Q11918833'>Eleusinians</pl> and defeated the invaders. Still earlier than this, when <prn id='Q207183'>Cassander</prn> had invaded <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl>, <prn id='Q1659401'>Olympiodorus</prn> sailed to <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolia</pl> and induced the <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolians</pl> to help. This allied force was the main reason why the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> escaped war with <prn id='Q207183'>Cassander</prn>. <prn id='Q1659401'>Olympiodorus</prn> has not only honors at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, both on the <pl id='Q131013'>Acropolis</pl> and in the <pl id='Q20616418'>Prytaneum</pl> but also a portrait at <pl id='Q94299853'>Eleusis</pl>. The <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> too of <pl id='Q1235347'>Elatea</pl> dedicated at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> a bronze statue of <prn id='Q1659401'>Olympiodorus</prn> for help in their revolt from <prn id='Q207183'>Cassander</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.26.4'><b>1.26.4</b> Near the statue of <prn id='Q1659401'>Olympiodorus</prn> stands a bronze image of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> surnamed <prn id='Q1821534'>Leucophryne</prn>, dedicated by the sons of <prn id='Q179552'>Themistocles</prn>; for the <pl id='Q1432674'>Magnesians</pl>, whose city the King had given him to rule, hold <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> <prn id='Q1821534'>Leucophryne</prn> in honor. But my narrative must not loiter, as my task is a general description of all Greece. <prn id='Q2327459'>Endoeus</prn> was an <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> by birth and a pupil of <prn id='Q134756'>Daedalus</prn>, who also, when <prn id='Q134756'>Daedalus</prn> was in exile because of the death of <prn id='Q2365581'>Calos</prn>, followed him to <pl id='Q4752820'>Crete</pl>. Made by him is a statue of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> seated, with an inscription that <prn id='Q970958'>Callias</prn> dedicated the image, but <prn id='Q2327459'>Endoeus</prn> made it. </p>
<p id='1.26.5'><b>1.26.5</b> There is also a building called the <pl id='Q242741'>Erechtheum</pl>. Before the entrance is an altar of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> Hypatos, on which they never sacrifice a living creature but offer cakes, not being wont to use any wine either. Inside the entrance are altars, one to <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, on which in obedience to an oracle they sacrifice also to <prn id='Q301219'>Erechtheus</prn>, the second to the hero <prn id='Q13156677'>Butes</prn>, and the third to <prn id='Q44384'>Hephaestus</prn>. On the walls are paintings representing members of the clan <pl id='Q13427314'>Butadae</pl>; there is also inside — the building is double — sea-water in a cistern. This is no great marvel, for other inland regions have similar wells, in particular <pl id='Q618495'>Aphrodisias</pl> in <pl id='Q193214'>Caria</pl>. But this cistern is remarkable for the noise of waves it sends forth when a south wind blows. On the rock is the outline of a trident. Legend says that these appeared as evidence in support of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>'s claim to the land. </p>
<p id='1.26.6'><b>1.26.6</b> Both the city and the whole of the land are alike sacred to <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>; for even those who in their demes have an established worship of other gods nevertheless hold <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> in honor. But the most holy symbol, that was so considered by all many years before the unification of the demes, is the agalma of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> which is on what is now called the <pl id='Q131013'>Acropolis</pl>, but in early days the polis (City). A legend concerning it says that it fell from heaven; whether this is true or not I shall not discuss. A golden lamp for the goddess was made by <prn id='Q553631'>Callimachus</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.26.7'><b>1.26.7</b> Having filled the lamp with oil, they wait until the same day next year, and the oil is sufficient for the lamp during the interval, although it is alight both day and night. The wick in it is of <pl id='Q1734309'>Carpasian</pl> flax, the only kind of flax which is fire-proof, and a bronze palm above the lamp reaches to the roof and draws off the smoke. The <prn id='Q553631'>Callimachus</prn> who made the lamp, although not of the first rank of artists, was yet of unparalleled cleverness, so that he was the first to drill holes through gems, and gave himself the title of Refiner of Art, or perhaps others gave the title and he adopted it as his. </p>
<p id='1.27.1'><b>1.27.1</b> In the <pl id='Q683988'>temple</pl> of [Athena] <prn id='Q107090895'>Polias</prn> is a wooden <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn>, said to have been dedicated by <prn id='Q500739'>Cecrops</prn>, but not visible because of myrtle boughs. The votive offerings worth noting are, of the old ones, a folding chair made by <prn id='Q134756'>Daedalus</prn>, <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl> spoils, namely the breastplate of <prn id='Q6783302'>Masistius</prn>, who commanded the cavalry at <pl id='Q204636'>Plataea</pl>, and a scimitar said to have belonged to <prn id='Q155063'>Mardonius</prn>. Now <prn id='Q6783302'>Masistius</prn> I know was killed by the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> cavalry. But <prn id='Q155063'>Mardonius</prn> was opposed by the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> and was killed by a <pl id='Q5690'>Spartan</pl>; so the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> could not have taken the scimitar to begin with, and furthermore the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> would scarcely have suffered them to carry it off. </p>
<p id='1.27.2'><b>1.27.2</b> About the olive they have nothing to say except that it was testimony the goddess produced when she contended for their land. Legend also says that when the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl> fired <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> the olive was burnt down, but on the very day it was burnt it grew again to the height of two cubits. Adjoining the <pl id='Q683988'>temple</pl> of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> is the temple of <prn id='Q633120'>Pandrosus</prn>, the only one of the sisters to be faithful to the trust. </p>
<p id='1.27.3'><b>1.27.3</b> I was much amazed at something which is not generally known, and so I will describe the circumstances. Two maidens <pl id='Q699480'>dwell not far</pl> from the <pl id='Q683988'>temple</pl> of <prn id='Q107090895'>Polias</prn>, called by the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> <prn id='Q699467'>Arrephoroi</prn> (Bearers of the Sacred Offerings). For a time they live with the goddess, but when the festival comes round they perform at night the following rites. Having placed on their heads what the priestess of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> gives them to carry — neither she who gives nor they who carry have any knowledge what it is — there is a precinct in the city called of Aphrodite in the Gardens, and there the maidens descend by the natural underground passage. They leave down below what they carry and receive something else which they bring back covered up. These maidens they henceforth let go free, and take up to the <pl id='Q131013'>Acropolis</pl> others in their place. </p>
<p id='1.27.4'><b>1.27.4</b> By the temple of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> is . . . an old woman about a cubit high, the inscription calling her a handmaid of <prn id='Q76247521'>Lysimache</prn>, and large bronze figures of men facing each other for a fight, one of whom they call <prn id='Q301219'>Erechtheus</prn>, the other <prn id='Q1125049'>Eumolpus</prn>; and yet those <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> who are acquainted with antiquity must surely know that this victim of <prn id='Q301219'>Erechtheus</prn> was <prn id='Q4200286'>Immaradus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q1125049'>Eumolpus</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.27.5'><b>1.27.5</b> On the pedestal are also statues of <prn id='Q107325191'>Theaenetus</prn>, who was seer to <prn id='Q1370557'>Tolmides</prn>, and of <prn id='Q1370557'>Tolmides</prn> himself, who when in command of the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> fleet inflicted severe damage upon the enemy, especially upon the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesians</pl> who dwell along the coast, burnt the dock-yards at <pl id='Q56398303'>Gythium</pl> and captured <pl id='Q11909406'>Boeae</pl>, belonging to the <prn id='Q288216'>Perioikoi</prn>, and the island of <pl id='Q11855334'>Cythera</pl>. He made a descent on <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonia</pl>, and, attacked by the citizens as he was laying waste the country, he put them to flight and chased them to the city. Returning afterwards to <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, he conducted <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> colonists to <pl id='Q173096'>Euboea</pl> and <pl id='Q96575378'>Naxos</pl> and invaded <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl> with an army. Having ravaged the greater part of the land and reduced <pl id='Q13574678'>Chaeronea</pl> by a siege, he advanced into the territory of <pl id='Q359627'>Haliartus</pl>, where he was killed in battle and all his army worsted. Such was the history of <prn id='Q1370557'>Tolmides</prn> that I learnt. </p>
<p id='1.27.6'><b>1.27.6</b> There are also old figures of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, no limbs of which indeed are missing, but they are rather black and too fragile to bear a blow. For they too were caught by the flames when the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> had gone on board their ships and the King captured the city emptied of its able-bodied inhabitants. There is also a boar-hunt (I do not know for certain whether it is the <prn id='Q654379'>Calydonian Boar</prn>) and <prn id='Q577245'>Cycnus</prn> fighting with <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>. This <prn id='Q577245'>Cycnus</prn> is said to have killed, among others, LycusYY a Thracian, a prize having been proposed for the winner of the duel, but near the river <pl id='Q376328'>Peneius</pl> he was himself killed by <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.27.7'><b>1.27.7</b> One of the <pl id='Q581494'>Troezenian</pl> legends about <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> is the following. When <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> visited <prn id='Q750580'>Pittheus</prn> at <pl id='Q581494'>Troezen</pl>, he laid aside his <prn id='Q140'>lion</prn>'s skin to eat his dinner, and there came in to see him some <pl id='Q581494'>Troezenian</pl> children with <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>, then about seven years of age. The story goes that when they saw the skin the other children ran away, but <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> slipped out not much afraid, seized an axe from the servants and straightway attacked the skin in earnest, thinking it to be a <prn id='Q140'>lion</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.27.8'><b>1.27.8</b> This is the first <pl id='Q581494'>Troezenian</pl> legend about <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>. The next is that <prn id='Q191725'>Aegeus</prn> placed boots and a sword under a rock as tokens for the child, and then sailed away to <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>; <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>, when sixteen years old, pushed the rock away and departed, taking what <prn id='Q191725'>Aegeus</prn> had deposited. There is a representation of this legend on the <pl id='Q131013'>Acropolis</pl>, everything in bronze except the rock. </p>
<p id='1.27.9'><b>1.27.9</b> Another deed of <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> they have represented in an offering, and the story about it is as follows: — The land of the <pl id='Q4752820'>Cretans</pl> and especially that by the river Tethris was ravaged by a <prn id='Q693690'>bull</prn>. It would seem that in the days of old the beasts were much more formidable to men, for example the <prn id='Q199438'>Nemean lion</prn>, the <prn id='Q140'>lion</prn> of <pl id='Q105261'>Parnassus</pl>, the <prn id='Q2102'>serpents</prn> in many parts of Greece, and the <prn id='Q654379'>boars</prn> of <pl id='Q750313'>Calydon</pl>, Eryrmanthus and <pl id='Q1789784'>Crommyon</pl> in the land of <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl>, so that it was said that some were sent up by the earth, that others were sacred to the gods, while others had been let loose to punish mankind. And so the <pl id='Q4752820'>Cretans</pl> say that this <prn id='Q693690'>bull</prn> was sent by <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> to their land because, although <prn id='Q23168'>Minos</prn> was lord of the Greek Sea, he did not worship <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> more than any other god. </p>
<p id='1.27.10'><b>1.27.10</b> They say that this <prn id='Q693690'>bull</prn> crossed from <pl id='Q4752820'>Crete</pl> to the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl>, and came to be one of what are called the Twelve Labours of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>. When he was let loose on the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl> plain he fled through the isthmus of <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl>, into the land of <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl> as far as the <pl id='Q122443'>Attic</pl> deme of <pl id='Q13423602'>Marathon</pl>, killing all he met, including <prn id='Q512388'>Androgeos</prn>, son of <prn id='Q23168'>Minos</prn>. <prn id='Q23168'>Minos</prn> sailed against <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> with a fleet, not believing that the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> were innocent of the death of <prn id='Q512388'>Androgeos</prn>, and sorely harassed them until it was agreed that he should take seven maidens and seven boys for the <prn id='Q129866'>Minotaur</prn> that was said to dwell in the Labyrinth at <pl id='Q173527'>Cnossus</pl>. But the <prn id='Q693690'>bull</prn> at <pl id='Q13423602'>Marathon</pl> <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> is said to have driven afterwards to the <pl id='Q131013'>Acropolis</pl> and to have sacrificed to the goddess; the offering commemorating this deed was dedicated by the deme of <pl id='Q13423602'>Marathon</pl>. </p>
<p id='1.28.1'><b>1.28.1</b> Why they set up a bronze statue of <prn id='Q433466'>Cylon</prn> in spite of his plotting a tyranny, I cannot say for certain; but I infer that it was because he was very beautiful to look upon, and of no undistinguished fame, having won an <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> victory in the double foot-race, while he had married the daughter of <prn id='Q183495'>Theagenes</prn>, tyrant of <pl id='Q42307600'>Megara</pl>. </p>
<p id='1.28.2'><b>1.28.2</b> In addition to the works I have mentioned, there are two tithes dedicated by the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> after wars. There is first a <pl id='Q755221'>bronze Athena</pl>, tithe from the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl> who landed at <pl id='Q31900'>Marathon</pl>. It is the work of <prn id='Q177302'>Pheidias</prn>, but the reliefs upon the shield, including the fight between <prn id='Q83203'>Centaurs</prn> and <prn id='Q334794'>Lapithae</prn>, are said to be from the chisel of <prn id='Q3869153'>Mys</prn>, for whom they say <prn id='Q552759'>Parrhasius</prn> the son of <prn id='Q11921357'>Evenor</prn>, designed this and the rest of his works. The point of the spear of this <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> and the crest of her helmet are visible to those sailing to <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, as soon as <pl id='Q1136637'>Sunium</pl> is passed. Then there is a bronze chariot, tithe from the <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotians</pl> and the <pl id='Q21235810'>Chalcidians</pl> in <pl id='Q173096'>Euboea</pl>. There are two other offerings, a statue of <prn id='Q80398'>Pericles</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q380401'>Xanthippus</prn>, and the best worth seeing of the works of <prn id='Q177302'>Pheidias</prn> the statue of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> called <pl id='Q192483'>Lemnian</pl> after those who dedicated it. </p>
<p id='1.28.3'><b>1.28.3</b> All the <pl id='Q131013'>Acropolis</pl> is surrounded by a wall; a part was constructed by <prn id='Q218102'>Cimon</prn>, son of <prn id='Q210350'>Miltiades</prn>, but all the rest is said to have been built round it by the <pl id='Q14472556'>Pelasgians</pl>, who once lived under the <pl id='Q131013'>Acropolis</pl>. The builders, they say, were <prn id='Q107550752'>Agrolas</prn> and <prn id='Q11925681'>Hyperbius</prn>. On inquiring who they were I could discover nothing except that they were <pl id='Q4951156'>Sicilians</pl> originally who emigrated to <pl id='Q416070'>Acarnania</pl>. </p>
<p id='1.28.4'><b>1.28.4</b> On descending, not to the lower city, but to just beneath the <pl id='Q3407649'>Propylaia</pl>, you see a <pl id='Q12879136'>spring of water</pl> and near it a <pl id='Q16328649'>sanctuary</pl> of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> in a cave. It is here that <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> is believed to have met <prn id='Q2196048'>Creusa</prn>, daughter of <prn id='Q301219'>Erechtheus</prn> . . . when the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl> had landed in <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl> <prn id='Q313728'>Philippides</prn> was sent to carry the tidings to <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl>. On his return he said that the Lacedaemonians had postponed their departure, because it was their custom not to go out to fight before the moon was full. <prn id='Q313728'>Philippides</prn> went on to say that near Mount <pl id='Q833949'>Parthenius</pl> he had been met by <prn id='Q132582'>Pan</prn>, who told him that he was friendly to the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> and would come to <pl id='Q31900'>Marathon</pl> to fight for them. This deity, then, has been honored for this announcement. </p>
<p id='1.28.5'><b>1.28.5</b> There is also the <pl id='Q202487'>Areos Pagos</pl>, so named because <prn id='Q40901'>Ares</prn> was the first to be tried here; my narrative has already told that he killed <prn id='Q592348'>Halirrhothius</prn>, and what were his grounds for this act. Afterwards, they say, <prn id='Q192407'>Orestes</prn> was tried for killing his mother, and there is an altar to <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> <prn id='Q106518607'>Areia</prn> (Warlike), which he dedicated on being acquitted. The unworked stones on which stand the defendants and the prosecutors, they call the stone of Hubris and the stone of Anaideia (Ruthlessness). </p>
<p id='1.28.6'><b>1.28.6</b> Hard by is a <pl id='Q116332640'>sanctuary of the goddesses</pl> which the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> call the <prn id='Q180262'>Semnai</prn>, but <prn id='Q44233'>Hesiod</prn> in the <prn id='Q156498'>Theogony</prn> calls them <prn id='Q180262'>Erinyes</prn> (Furies). It was <prn id='Q40939'>Aeschylus</prn> who first represented them with <prn id='Q2102'>snakes</prn> in their hair. But on the images neither of these nor of any of the under-world deities is there anything terrible. There are images of <prn id='Q152262'>Plouton</prn>, <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn>, and <prn id='Q93172'>Earth</prn>, by which sacrifice those who have received an acquittal on the <pl id='Q202487'>Areos Pagos</pl>; sacrifices are also offered on other occasions by both citizens and aliens. </p>
<p id='1.28.7'><b>1.28.7</b> Within the precinct is a monument to <prn id='Q130890'>Oedipus</prn>, whose bones, after diligent inquiry, I found were brought from <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>. The account of the death of <prn id='Q130890'>Oedipus</prn> in the drama of <prn id='Q7235'>Sophocles</prn> I am prevented from believing by <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>, who says that after the death of <prn id='Q130890'>Oedipus</prn> <prn id='Q1968413'>Mecisteus</prn> came to <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> and took part in the funeral games. </p>
<p id='1.28.8'><b>1.28.8</b> The <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> have other law courts as well, which are not so famous. We have the Parabyston (Thrust aside) and the Triangle; the former is in an obscure part of the city, and in it the most trivial cases are tried; the latter is named from its shape. The names of Green Court and Red Court, due to their colors, have lasted down to the present day. The largest court, to which the greatest numbers come, is called <prn id='Q1057378'>Heliaia</prn>. One of the other courts that deal with bloodshed is called “At <pl id='Q12882658'>Palladium</pl>,” into which are brought cases of involuntary homicide. All are agreed that <prn id='Q912376'>Demophon</prn> was the first to be tried there, but as to the nature of the charge accounts differ. </p>
<p id='1.28.9'><b>1.28.9</b> It is reported that after the capture of <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl> <prn id='Q208256'>Diomedes</prn> was returning home with his fleet when night overtook them as in their voyage they were off <pl id='Q534927'>Phalerum</pl>. The <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> landed, under the impression that it was hostile territory, the darkness preventing them from seeing that it was <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl>. Thereupon they say that <prn id='Q912376'>Demophon</prn>, he too being unaware of the facts and ignorant that those who had landed were <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>, attacked them and, having killed a number of them, went off with the <prn id='Q829650'>Palladium</prn>. An <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl>, however, not seeing before him in the dark, was knocked over by the <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn> of <prn id='Q912376'>Demophon</prn>, trampled upon and killed. Whereupon <prn id='Q912376'>Demophon</prn> was brought to trial, some say by the relatives of the man who was trampled upon, others say by the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl> commonwealth. </p>
<p id='1.28.10'><b>1.28.10</b> At the <pl id='Q97206898'>Delphinium</pl> are tried those who claim that they have committed justifiable homicide, the plea put forward by <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> when he was acquitted, after having killed <prn id='Q429306'>Pallas</prn>, who had risen in revolt against him, and his sons. Before <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> was acquitted it was the established custom among all men for the shedder of blood to go into exile, or, if he remained, to be put to a similar death. The court in the <pl id='Q20616418'>Prytaneum</pl>, as it is called, where they try iron and all similar inanimate things, had its origin, I believe, in the following incident. It was when <prn id='Q301219'>Erechtheus</prn> was king of <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> that the ox-slayer first killed an <prn id='Q473194'>ox</prn> at the <pl id='Q1595395'>altar</pl> of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q107349746'>Polieus</prn>. Leaving the axe where it lay he went out of the land into exile, and the axe was forthwith tried and acquitted, and the trial has been repeated year by year down to the present. </p>
<p id='1.28.11'><b>1.28.11</b> Furthermore, it is also said that inanimate objects have on occasion of their own accord inflicted righteous retribution upon men, of this the scimitar of <prn id='Q182483'>Cambyses</prn> affords the best and most famous instance. Near the sea at the <pl id='Q13426467'>Peiraeus</pl> is <pl id='Q24040803'>Phreattys</pl>. Here it is that men in exile, when a further charge has been brought against them in their absence, make their defense on a ship while the judges listen on land. The legend is that <prn id='Q878184'>Teucer</prn> first defended himself in this way before <prn id='Q331327'>Telamon</prn>, urging that he was guiltless in the matter of the death of <prn id='Q172725'>Ajax</prn>. Let this account suffice for those who are interested to learn about the law courts. </p>
<p id='1.29.1'><b>1.29.1</b> Near the <pl id='Q202487'>Areos Pagos</pl> is shown a ship built for the procession of the <prn id='Q1162701'>Panathenaea</prn>. This ship, I suppose, has been surpassed in size by others, but I know of no builder who has beaten the vessel at <pl id='Q173148'>Delos</pl>, with its nine banks of oars below the deck. </p>
<p id='1.29.2'><b>1.29.2</b> Outside the city, too, in the demes and on the roads, the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> have sanctuaries of the gods, and graves of heroes and of men. The nearest is the <pl id='Q193093'>Academy</pl>, once the property of a private individual, but in my time a gymnasium. As you go down to it you come to a precinct of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, and <prn id='Q693222'>xoana</prn> (wooden images) of Ariste (Best) and <prn id='Q56452489'>Calliste</prn> (Fairest). In my opinion, which is supported by the poems of <prn id='Q11939948'>Pamphos</prn>, these are surnames of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>. There is another account of them, which I know but shall omit. Then there is a small temple, into which every year on fixed days they carry the image of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> Eleuthereus. </p>
<p id='1.29.3'><b>1.29.3</b> Such are their sanctuaries here, and of the graves the first is that of <prn id='Q354403'>Thrasybulus</prn> son of LycusYY, in all respects the greatest of all famous <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, whether they lived before him or after him. The greater number of his achievements I shall pass by, but the following facts will suffice to bear out my assertion. He put down what is known as the tyranny of the <prn id='Q643488'>Thirty</prn>, setting out from <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> with a force amounting at first to sixty men; he also persuaded the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, who were torn by factions, to be reconciled, and to abide by their compact. His is the first grave, and after it come those of <prn id='Q80398'>Pericles</prn>, <prn id='Q543525'>Chabrias</prn> and <prn id='Q2338787'>Phormio</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.29.4'><b>1.29.4</b> There is also a <pl id='Q116312064'>monument</pl> for all the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> whose fate it has been to fall in battle, whether at sea or on land, except such of them as fought at <pl id='Q31900'>Marathon</pl>. These, for their valor, have their graves on the field of battle, but the others lie along the road to the <pl id='Q193093'>Academy</pl>, and on their graves stand slabs bearing the name and deme of each. First were buried those who in <pl id='Q41741'>Thrace</pl>, after a victorious advance as far as <pl id='Q11917732'>Drabescus</pl>, were unexpectedly attacked by the <pl id='Q3719711'>Edonians</pl> and slaughtered. There is also a legend that they were struck by lightning. </p>
<p id='1.29.5'><b>1.29.5</b> Among the generals were <prn id='Q11931265'>Leagrus</prn>, to whom was entrusted chief command of the army, and <prn id='Q6131170'>Sophanes</prn> of <pl id='Q1006561'>Decelea</pl>, who killed when he came to the help of the <pl id='Q191082'>Aeginetans</pl> <prn id='Q18010038'>Eurybates</prn> the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl>, who won the prize in the pentathlon at the <prn id='Q527006'>Nemean games</prn>. This was the third expedition which the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> dispatched out of Greece. For against <prn id='Q170473'>Priam</prn> and the <pl id='Q22647'>Trojans</pl> war was made with one accord by all the Greeks; but by them selves the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> sent armies, first with <prn id='Q504076'>Iolaus</prn> to <pl id='Q3760293'>Sardinia</pl>, secondly to what is now <pl id='Q620874'>Ionia</pl>, and thirdly on the present occasion to <pl id='Q41741'>Thrace</pl>. </p>
<p id='1.29.6'><b>1.29.6</b> Before the monument is a slab on which are horsemen fighting. Their names are <prn id='Q107325506'>Melanopus</prn> and MacartatuYY, who met their death fighting against the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> and <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotians</pl> on the borders of Eleon and <pl id='Q56259452'>Tanagra</pl>. There is also a grave of <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessalian</pl> horsemen who, by reason of an old alliance, came when the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesians</pl> with <prn id='Q313731'>Archidamus</prn> invaded <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl> with an army for the first time, and hard by that of <pl id='Q4752820'>Cretan</pl> bowmen. Again there are monuments to <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>: to <prn id='Q207634'>Cleisthenes</prn>, who invented the system of the tribes at present existing, and to horsemen who died when the <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessalians</pl> shared the fortune of war with the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>. </p>
<p id='1.29.7'><b>1.29.7</b> Here too lie the <pl id='Q1774167'>Cleonaeans</pl>, who came with the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> into <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl>; the occasion whereof I shall set forth when in the course of my narrative I come to the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>. There is also the grave of the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> who fought against the <pl id='Q191082'>Aeginetans</pl> before the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl> invasion. It was surely a just decree even for a democracy when the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> actually allowed slaves a public funeral, and to have their names inscribed on a slab, which declares that in the war they proved good men and true to their masters. There are also monuments of other men, their fields of battle lying in various regions. Here lie the most renowned of those who went against <pl id='Q1141669'>Olynthus</pl>, and <prn id='Q11936412'>Melesander</prn> who sailed with a fleet along the <pl id='Q211089'>Maeander</pl> into upper <pl id='Q193214'>Caria</pl>; </p>
<p id='1.29.8'><b>1.29.8</b> also those who died in the war with <prn id='Q207183'>Cassander</prn>, and the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> who once fought as the allies of <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>. It is said that the alliance between the two peoples was brought about thus. <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> was once shaken by an earthquake, and the <prn id='Q462484'>Helots</prn> seceded to <pl id='Q602538'>Ithome</pl>. After the secession the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> sent for help to various places, including <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, which dispatched picked troops under the command of <prn id='Q218102'>Cimon</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q210350'>Miltiades</prn>. These the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> dismissed, because they suspected them. </p>
<p id='1.29.9'><b>1.29.9</b> The <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> regarded the insult as intolerable, and on their way back made an alliance with the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>, the immemorial enemies of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. Afterwards, when a battle was imminent at <pl id='Q56259452'>Tanagra</pl>, the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> opposing the <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotians</pl> and <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> reinforced the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>. For a time the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> had the better, but night came on and took from them the assurance of their victory, and on the next day the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> had the better, as the <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessalians</pl> betrayed the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>. </p>
<p id='1.29.10'><b>1.29.10</b> It occurred to me to tell of the following men also, firstly <prn id='Q11906225'>Apollodorus</prn>, commander of the mercenaries, who was an <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> dispatched by <prn id='Q632801'>Arsites</prn>, satrap of <pl id='Q32579'>Phrygia</pl> by the <pl id='Q6514'>Hellespont</pl>, and saved their city for the <pl id='Q11815679'>Perinthians</pl> when <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn> had invaded their territory with an army. He, then, is buried here, and also <prn id='Q1292981'>Eubulus</prn> the son of SpintharuYY, along with men who though brave were not attended by good fortune; some attacked <prn id='Q1241666'>Lachares</prn> when he was tyrant, others planned the capture of the <pl id='Q13426467'>Peiraeus</pl> when in the hands of a <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonian</pl> garrison, but before the deed could be accomplished were betrayed by their accomplices and put to death. </p>
<p id='1.29.11'><b>1.29.11</b> Here also lie those who fell near <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl>. Heaven showed most distinctly here and again at <pl id='Q2606004'>Leuctra</pl> that those whom the Greeks call brave are as nothing if <prn id='Q213440'>Good Fortune</prn> be not with them, seeing that the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, who had on this occasion overcome <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthians</pl> and <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, and furthermore <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> and <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotians</pl>, were afterwards at <pl id='Q2606004'>Leuctra</pl> so utterly overthrown by the <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotians</pl> alone. After those who were killed at <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl>, we come across elegiac verses declaring that one and the same slab has been erected to those who died in <pl id='Q173096'>Euboea</pl> and <pl id='Q748832'>Chios</pl>, and to those who perished in the remote parts of the continent of <prn id='Q48'>Asia</prn>, or in <pl id='Q4951156'>Sicily</pl>. </p>
<p id='1.29.12'><b>1.29.12</b> The names of the generals are inscribed with the exception of <prn id='Q315822'>Nicias</prn>, and among the private soldiers are included the <pl id='Q742538'>Plataeans</pl> along with the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>. This is the reason why <prn id='Q315822'>Nicias</prn> was passed over, and my account is identical with that of <prn id='Q712572'>Philistus</prn>, who says that while <prn id='Q504986'>Demosthenes</prn> made a truce for the others and excluded himself, attempting to commit suicide when taken prisoner, <prn id='Q315822'>Nicias</prn> voluntarily submitted to the surrender. For this reason <prn id='Q315822'>Nicias</prn> had not his name inscribed on the slab, being condemned as a voluntary prisoner and an unworthy soldier. </p>
<p id='1.29.13'><b>1.29.13</b> On another slab are the names of those who fought in the region of <pl id='Q41741'>Thrace</pl> and at <pl id='Q42307600'>Megara</pl>, and when <prn id='Q187982'>Alcibiades</prn> persuaded the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> in <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantinea</pl> and the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> to revolt from the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, and of those who were victorious over the <pl id='Q4420718'>Syracusans</pl> before <prn id='Q504986'>Demosthenes</prn> arrived in <pl id='Q4951156'>Sicily</pl>. Here were buried also those who fought in the sea-fights near the <pl id='Q6514'>Hellespont</pl>, those who opposed the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> at <pl id='Q13574678'>Chaeronea</pl>, those who took part in the expedition with <prn id='Q298220'>Cleon</prn> to <pl id='Q217414'>Amphipolis</pl>, those who were killed at <pl id='Q1184284'>Delium</pl> in the territory of <pl id='Q56259452'>Tanagra</pl>, the men <prn id='Q183109'>Leosthenes</prn> led into <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessaly</pl>, those who sailed with <prn id='Q218102'>Cimon</prn> to <pl id='Q644636'>Cyprus</pl>, and of those who with <prn id='Q1659401'>Olympiodorus</prn> expelled the garrison not more than thirteen men. </p>
<p id='1.29.14'><b>1.29.14</b> The <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> declare that when the Romans were waging a border war they sent a small force to help them, and later on five <pl id='Q122443'>Attic</pl> warships assisted the Romans in a naval action against the <pl id='Q6343'>Carthaginians</pl>. Accordingly these men also have their grave here. The achievements of <prn id='Q1370557'>Tolmides</prn> and his men, and the manner of their death, I have already set forth, and any who are interested may take note that they are buried along this road. Here lie too those who with <prn id='Q218102'>Cimon</prn> achieved the great feat of winning a land and naval victory on one and the same day. </p>
<p id='1.29.15'><b>1.29.15</b> Here also are buried <prn id='Q363832'>Conon</prn> and <prn id='Q713679'>Timotheus</prn>, father and son, the second pair thus related to accomplish illustrious deeds, <prn id='Q210350'>Miltiades</prn> and <prn id='Q218102'>Cimon</prn> being the first; <prn id='Q171303'>Zeno</prn> too, the son of <prn id='Q1230889'>Mnaseas</prn> and <prn id='Q211411'>Chrysippus</prn> of <pl id='Q656954'>Soli</pl>, <prn id='Q2583871'>Nicias</prn> the son of <prn id='Q21855594'>Nicomedes</prn>, the best painter from life of all his contemporaries, <prn id='Q21546504'>Harmodius</prn> and <prn id='Q718117'>Aristogeiton</prn>, who killed <prn id='Q435531'>Hipparchus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q242172'>Peisistratus</prn>; there are also two orators, <prn id='Q318731'>Ephialtes</prn>, who was chiefly responsible for the abolition of the privileges of the <pl id='Q202487'>Areopagus</pl>, and <prn id='Q373685'>Lycurgus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q432737'>Lycophron</prn>; </p>
<p id='1.29.16'><b>1.29.16</b> <prn id='Q373685'>Lycurgus</prn> provided for the state-treasury six thousand five hundred talents more than <prn id='Q80398'>Pericles</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q380401'>Xanthippus</prn>, collected, and furnished for the procession of the Goddess golden figures of <prn id='Q165023'>Victory</prn> and ornaments for a hundred maidens; for war he provided arms and missiles, besides increasing the fleet to four hundred warships. As for buildings, he completed the <pl id='Q1227044'>theater</pl> that others had begun, while during his political life he built dockyards in the <pl id='Q13426467'>Peiraeus</pl> and the gymnasium near what is called the <pl id='Q1160664'>Lyceum</pl>. Everything made of silver or gold became part of the plunder <prn id='Q1241666'>Lachares</prn> made away with when he became tyrant, but the buildings remained to my time. </p>
<p id='1.30.1'><b>1.30.1</b> Before the entrance to the <pl id='Q193093'>Academy</pl> is an altar to <prn id='Q121973'>Eros</prn>, with an inscription that CharmusYY was the first <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> to dedicate an altar to that god. The altar within the city called the altar of <prn id='Q572133'>Anteros</prn> (Reciprocal Love) they say was dedicated by resident aliens, because the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> Meles, spurning the love of <prn id='Q114319165'>Timagoras</prn>, a resident alien, bade him ascend to the highest point of the rock and cast himself down. Now <prn id='Q114319165'>Timagoras</prn> took no account of his life, and was ready to gratify the youth in any of his requests, so he went and cast himself down. When Meles saw that <prn id='Q114319165'>Timagoras</prn> was dead, he suffered such pangs of remorse that he threw himself from the same rock and so died. From this time the resident aliens worshipped as <prn id='Q572133'>Anteros</prn> the avenging spirit of <prn id='Q114319165'>Timagoras</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.30.2'><b>1.30.2</b> In the <pl id='Q193093'>Academy</pl> is an altar to <prn id='Q83160'>Prometheus</prn>, and from it they run to the city carrying burning torches. The contest is while running to keep the torch still alight; if the torch of the first runner goes out, he has no longer any claim to victory, but the second runner has. If his torch also goes out, then the third man is the victor. If all the torches go out, no one is left to be winner. There is an altar to the <prn id='Q66016'>Muses</prn>, and another to <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn>, and one within to <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, and they have built one to <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>. There is also an olive tree, accounted to be the second that appeared. </p>
<p id='1.30.3'><b>1.30.3</b> Not far from the <pl id='Q193093'>Academy</pl> is the monument of <prn id='Q859'>Plato</prn>, to whom heaven foretold that he would be the prince of philosophers. The manner of the foretelling was this. On the night before <prn id='Q859'>Plato</prn> was to become his pupil <prn id='Q913'>Socrates</prn> in a dream saw a swan fly into his bosom. Now the swan is a bird with a reputation for music, because, they say, a musician of the name of <prn id='Q1094710'>Cycnus</prn> (swan) became king of the <pl id='Q207023'>Ligyes</pl> on the other side of the <pl id='Q643'>Eridanus</pl> beyond the <pl id='Q35966'>Celtic</pl> territory, and after his death by the will of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> he was changed into the bird. I am ready to believe that a musician became king of the <pl id='Q207023'>Ligyes</pl>, but I cannot believe that a bird grew out of a man. </p>
<p id='1.30.4'><b>1.30.4</b> In this part of the country is seen the tower of <prn id='Q1747004'>Timon</prn>, the only man to see that there is no way to be happy except to shun other men. There is also pointed out a place called the Hill of Horses, the first point in <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl>, they say, that <prn id='Q130890'>Oedipus</prn> reached — this account too differs from that given by <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>, but it is nevertheless current tradition — and an altar to <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> <prn id='Q20100719'>Hippios</prn>, and to <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> <prn id='Q20100719'>Hippia</prn>, and a heroon for <prn id='Q502156'>Peirithous</prn> and <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>, <prn id='Q130890'>Oedipus</prn> and <prn id='Q223152'>Adrastus</prn>. The grove of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> and the temple were burnt by <prn id='Q200401'>Antigonus</prn> when he invaded <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl>, who at other times also ravaged the land of the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>. </p>
<p id='1.31.1'><b>1.31.1</b> The small demes of <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl>, which were founded severally as chance would have it, presented the following noteworthy features. At <pl id='Q13464895'>Alimus</pl> is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> <prn id='Q2401559'>Thesmophoros</prn> and <prn id='Q45967'>Kore</prn>, and at <pl id='Q7698709'>Zoster</pl> (Girdle) on the coast is an altar to <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, as well as to <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, to <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> and to <prn id='Q103107'>Leto</prn>. The story is that <prn id='Q103107'>Leto</prn> did not give birth to her children here, but loosened her girdle with a view to her delivery, and the place received its name from this incident. <pl id='Q3407713'>Prospalta</pl> has also a sanctuary of <prn id='Q45967'>Kore</prn> and <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>, and <pl id='Q4750861'>Anagyrus</pl> a sanctuary of the <prn id='Q334486'>Mother of the Gods</prn>. At <pl id='Q13445967'>Cephale</pl> the chief cult is that of the <prn id='Q190103'>Dioscuri</prn>, for the in habitants call them the Great Gods. </p>
<p id='1.31.2'><b>1.31.2</b> At <pl id='Q2107853'>Prasiae</pl> is a temple of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>. Hither they say are sent the first-fruits of the <prn id='Q12871715'>Hyperboreans</prn>, and the <prn id='Q12871715'>Hyperboreans</prn> are said to hand them over to the <prn id='Q661584'>Arimaspi</prn>, the <prn id='Q661584'>Arimaspi</prn> to the <prn id='Q1079061'>Issedones</prn>, from these the <pl id='Q845909'>Scythians</pl> bring them to <pl id='Q107557833'>Sinope</pl>, thence they are carried by Greeks to <pl id='Q2107853'>Prasiae</pl>, and the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> take them to <pl id='Q106802906'>Delos</pl>. The first-fruits are hidden in wheat straw, and they are known of none. There is at <pl id='Q2107853'>Prasiae</pl> a monument to <prn id='Q491615'>Erysichthon</prn>, who died on the voyage home from <pl id='Q173148'>Delos</pl>, after the sacred mission (theoria) thither. </p>
<p id='1.31.3'><b>1.31.3</b> How <prn id='Q474854'>Amphictyon</prn> banished <prn id='Q928411'>Cranaus</prn>, his kinsman by marriage and king of <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, I have already related. They say that fleeing with his supporters to the deme of <pl id='Q13422779'>Lamptrae</pl> he died and was buried there, and at the present day there is a monument to <prn id='Q928411'>Cranaus</prn> at <pl id='Q13422779'>Lamptrae</pl>. At <pl id='Q18015506'>Potami</pl> in <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl> is also the grave of <prn id='Q853462'>Ion</prn> the son of <prn id='Q514746'>Xuthus</prn> — for he too dwelt among the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> and was their commander-in-chief in the war with <pl id='Q11918833'>Eleusis</pl>. </p>
<p id='1.31.4'><b>1.31.4</b> Such is the legend. But for what there is at <pl id='Q13424335'>Phlya</pl> and <pl id='Q1431270'>Myrrhinus</pl>, the former has altars of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> <prn id='Q107349752'>Dionysodotus</prn>, <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> <prn id='Q107349754'>Selasphoros</prn>, <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> <prn id='Q107349751'>Anthios</prn> (Flowery), the <prn id='Q114291538'>Ismenid Nymphs</prn> and <prn id='Q93172'>Earth</prn>, whom they name the Great Goddess; another temple contains altars of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> <prn id='Q107349749'>Anesidora</prn> (Sender-up of Gifts), <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q59070137'>Ctesius</prn>, <prn id='Q107349755'>Tithrone</prn> <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, the <prn id='Q45967'>Kore</prn> <prn id='Q107349753'>Protogone</prn> (First-born) and the so-called <prn id='Q180262'>Solemn Goddesses</prn> (Eumenides/Furies). At <pl id='Q1431270'>Myrrhinus</pl>, the <prn id='Q693222'>xoanon</prn> is of <prn id='Q58451195'>Colaenis</prn>. <pl id='Q12872216'>Athmonia</pl> worships <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> <prn id='Q21548413'>Amarysia</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.31.5'><b>1.31.5</b> On inquiry I discovered that the guides knew nothing about these deities, so I give my own conjecture. <pl id='Q1227665'>Amarynthus</pl> is a town in <pl id='Q173096'>Euboea</pl>, the inhabitants of which worship <prn id='Q21548413'>Amarysia</prn>, while the festival of <prn id='Q3561370'>Amarysia</prn> which the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> celebrate is no less splendid than the <pl id='Q173096'>Euboean</pl>. The name of the goddess, I think, came to <pl id='Q12872216'>Athmonia</pl> in this fashion and the <prn id='Q58451195'>Colaenis</prn> in <pl id='Q1431270'>Myrrhinus</pl> is called after <prn id='Q3682580'>Colaenus</prn>. I have already written that many of the inhabitants of the demes say that they were ruled by kings even before the reign of <prn id='Q500739'>Cecrops</prn>. Now <prn id='Q3682580'>Colaenus</prn>, say the <pl id='Q1431270'>Myrrhinusians</pl>, is the name of a man who ruled before <prn id='Q500739'>Cecrops</prn> became king. </p>
<p id='1.31.6'><b>1.31.6</b> There is a deme called <pl id='Q576319'>Acharnae</pl>, where they worship <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> <prn id='Q3848037'>Agyieus</prn> (God of Streets) and <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, and there is an altar of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> <prn id='Q107306832'>Hygeia</prn> (Health). And they call <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> <prn id='Q20100719'>Hippia</prn> and <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> <prn id='Q107349740'>Melpomenos</prn> and <prn id='Q3678230'>Kissos</prn> (Ivy), saying that the plant ivy first appeared there. </p>
<p id='1.32.1'><b>1.32.1</b> The <pl id='Q122443'>Attic</pl> mountains are <pl id='Q1125206'>Pentelikon</pl>, where there are quarries, <pl id='Q781855'>Parnes</pl>, where there is hunting of wild <prn id='Q58697'>boars</prn> and of bears, and <pl id='Q1232266'>Hymettus</pl>, which grows the most suitable pasture for <prn id='Q102857'>bees</prn>, except that of the <prn id='Q123278836'>Alazones</prn>. For at Alazon they have actually <prn id='Q102857'>bees</prn> ranging free, tamely following the other creatures when they go to pasture. These <prn id='Q102857'>bees</prn> are not kept shut up in hives, and they work in any part of the land they happen to visit. They produce a solid mass from which you cannot separate either wax or honey. Such then is its nature. </p>
<p id='1.32.2'><b>1.32.2</b> The <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> have also statues of gods on their mountains. On <pl id='Q1125206'>Pentele</pl> is a statue of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, on <pl id='Q1232266'>Hymettus</pl> one of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q107349759'>Hymettius</prn>. There are altars both of Zeus <prn id='Q107349760'>Ombrios</prn> (Rainy) and of Apollo Proopsios (Foreseer or First Seen). On <pl id='Q781855'>Parnes</pl> is a bronze <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <PRN id='Q107349761>Parnethius</PRN>, and an altar to <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q107349762'>Semaleus</prn> (Sign-giving). There is on <pl id='Q781855'>Parnes</pl> another altar, and on it they make sacrifice, calling <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> sometimes <prn id='Q107349760'>Ombrios</prn>, sometimes <prn id='Q107349758'>Apemios</prn> (Averter). <pl id='Q92937987'>Anchesmus</pl> is a mountain of no great size, with an image of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q107349756'>Anchesmius</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.32.3'><b>1.32.3</b> Before turning to a description of the islands, I must again proceed with my account of the demes. There is a deme called <pl id='Q13423602'>Marathon</pl>, equally distant from <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> and <pl id='Q13554032'>Carystus</pl> in <pl id='Q173096'>Euboea</pl>. It was at this point in <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl> that the foreigners landed, were defeated in battle, and lost some of their vessels as they were putting off from the land. On the <pl id='Q81645930'>plain</pl> is the <pl id='Q17276497'>grave</pl> of the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, and upon it are slabs giving the names of the killed according to their tribes; and there is another grave for the <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotian</pl> <pl id='Q742538'>Plataeans</pl> and for the slaves, for slaves fought then for the first time by the side of their masters. </p>
<p id='1.32.4'><b>1.32.4</b> Here is also a separate monument to one man, <prn id='Q210350'>Miltiades</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q14278582'>Cimon</prn>, although his end came later, after he had failed to take <pl id='Q65040323'>Paros</pl> and for this reason had been brought to trial by the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>. At <pl id='Q31900'>Marathon</pl> every night you can hear <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn> neighing and men fighting. No one who has expressly set himself to behold this vision has ever got any good from it, but the spirits are not wroth with such as in ignorance chance to be spectators. The <pl id='Q13423602'>Marathonians</pl> worship both those who died in the fighting, calling them heroes, and secondly <prn id='Q1638952'>Marathon</prn>, from whom the deme derives its name, and then <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> [shrine], saying that they were the first among the Greeks to acknowledge him as a god. </p>
<p id='1.32.5'><b>1.32.5</b> They say too that there chanced to be present in the battle a man of rustic appearance and dress. Having slaughtered many of the foreigners with a plough he was seen no more after the engagement. When the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> made enquiries at the oracle the god merely ordered them to honor <prn id='Q5332383'>Echetlaeus</prn> (He of the Plough-tail) as a hero. A trophy too of white marble has been erected. Although the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> assert that they buried the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl>, because in every case the divine law applies that a corpse should be laid under the earth, yet I could find no grave. There was neither mound nor other trace to be seen, as the dead were carried to a trench and thrown in anyhow. </p>
<p id='1.32.6'><b>1.32.6</b> In <pl id='Q13423602'>Marathon</pl> is a spring called Macaria with the following legend. When <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> left <pl id='Q217379'>Tiryns</pl>, fleeing from <prn id='Q212087'>Eurystheus</prn>, he went to live with his friend <prn id='Q578888'>Ceyx</prn>, who was king of Trachis. But when <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> departed this life <prn id='Q212087'>Eurystheus</prn> demanded his children; whereupon the king of Trachis sent them to <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, saying that he was weak but <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> had power enough to succor them. The arrival of the children as suppliants caused for the first time war between <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesians</pl> and <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> refusing to give up the refugees at the demand of <prn id='Q212087'>Eurystheus</prn>. The story says that an oracle was given the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> that one of the children of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> must die a voluntary death, or else victory could not be theirs. Thereupon <prn id='Q1550960'>Macaria</prn>, daughter of <prn id='Q272000'>Deianeira</prn> and <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, slew herself and gave to the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> victory in the war and to the spring her own name. </p>
<p id='1.32.7'><b>1.32.7</b> There is at <pl id='Q13423602'>Marathon</pl> a lake which for the most part is marshy. Into this ignorance of the roads made the foreigners fall in their flight, and it is said that this accident was the cause of their great losses. Above the lake are the stone stables of <prn id='Q312893'>Artaphernes</prn>' <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn>, and marks of his tent on the rocks. Out of the lake flows a river, affording near the lake itself water suitable for <prn id='Q830'>cattle</prn>, but near its mouth it becomes salt and full of sea fish. A little beyond the plain is the Hill of <prn id='Q132582'>Pan</prn> and a remarkable <pl id='Q38283203'>Cave of Pan</pl>. The entrance to it is narrow, but farther in are chambers and baths and the so-called “<prn id='Q132582'>Pan</prn>'s herd of <prn id='Q2934'>goats</prn>,” which are rocks shaped in most respects like to <prn id='Q2934'>goats</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.33.1'><b>1.33.1</b> At some distance from <pl id='Q13423602'>Marathon</pl> is <pl id='Q475497'>Brauron</pl>, where, according to the legend, <prn id='Q192673'>Iphigenia</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn>, landed with the image of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> when she fled from the <pl id='Q7835'>Tauri</pl>; leaving the image there she came to <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> also and afterwards to <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>. There is indeed an old wooden image of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> here, but who in my opinion have the one taken from the foreigners I will set forth in another place. </p>
<p id='1.33.2'><b>1.33.2</b> About sixty stades from <pl id='Q13423602'>Marathon</pl> as you go along the road by the sea to <pl id='Q18073696'>Oropus</pl> stands <pl id='Q1768553'>Rhamnus</pl>. The dwelling houses are on the coast, but a little way inland is a <pl id='Q94946184'>sanctuary of Nemesis</pl>, the most implacable deity to men guilty of hubris. It is thought that the wrath of this goddess fell also upon the foreigners who landed at <pl id='Q31900'>Marathon</pl>. For thinking in their pride that nothing stood in the way of their taking <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, they were bringing a piece of <pl id='Q65040323'>Parian</pl> marble to make a trophy, convinced that their task was already finished. </p>
<p id='1.33.3'><b>1.33.3</b> Of this marble <prn id='Q177302'>Pheidias</prn> made a <prn id='Q114296149'>statue</prn> of <prn id='Q185747'>Nemesis</prn>, and on the head of the goddess is a crown with deer and small images of <prn id='Q165023'>Victory</prn>. In her left hand she holds an apple branch, in her right hand a cup on which are wrought <pl id='Q410453'>Aethiopians</pl>. As to the <pl id='Q410453'>Aethiopians</pl>, I could hazard no guess myself, nor could I accept the statement of those who are convinced that the <pl id='Q410453'>Aethiopians</pl> have been carved upon the cup because of the river <prn id='Q107549003'>Ocean</prn>. For the <pl id='Q410453'>Aethiopians</pl>, they say, dwell near it, and <prn id='Q161419'>Ocean</prn> is the father of <prn id='Q185747'>Nemesis</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.33.4'><b>1.33.4</b> It is not the river <prn id='Q107549003'>Ocean</prn>, but the farthest part of the sea navigated by man, near which dwell the <pl id='Q1203967'>Iberians</pl> and the <pl id='Q35966'>Celts</pl>, and <prn id='Q107549003'>Ocean</prn> surrounds the island of <pl id='Q185103'>Britain</pl>. But of the <pl id='Q410453'>Aethiopians</pl> beyond <pl id='Q29888'>Syene</pl>, those who live farthest in the direction of the <pl id='Q1363807'>Red Sea</pl> are the <prn id='Q1096303'>Ichthyophagi</prn> (Fish-eaters), and the gulf round which they live is called after them. The most righteous of them inhabit the city <pl id='Q5780'>Meroe</pl> and what is called the <pl id='Q410453'>Aethiopian</pl> plain. These are they who show the Table of the <prn id='Q134270'>Sun</prn>, and they have neither sea nor river except the <pl id='Q3392'>Nile</pl>. </p>
<p id='1.33.5'><b>1.33.5</b> There are other <pl id='Q410453'>Aethiopians</pl> who are neighbours of the MauriYY and extend as far as the <pl id='Q1215696'>Nasamones</pl>. For the <pl id='Q1215696'>Nasamones</pl>, whom <prn id='Q26825'>Herodotus</prn> calls the Atlantes, and those who profess to know the measurements of the earth name the <pl id='Q923835'>Lixitae</pl>, are the <pl id='Q2370577'>Libyans</pl> who live the farthest close to Mount <prn id='Q130135'>Atlas</prn>, and they do not till the ground at all, but live on wild vines. But neither these <pl id='Q410453'>Aethiopians</pl> nor yet the <pl id='Q1215696'>Nasamones</pl> have any river. For the water near <prn id='Q130135'>Atlas</prn>, which provides a beginning to three streams, does not make any of the streams a river, as the sand swallows it all up at once. So the <pl id='Q410453'>Aethiopians</pl> dwell near no river Ocean. </p>
<p id='1.33.6'><b>1.33.6</b> The water from <prn id='Q130135'>Atlas</prn> is muddy, and near the source were crocodiles of not less than two cubits, which when the men approached dashed down into the spring. The thought has occurred to many that it is the reappearance of this water out of the sand which gives the <pl id='Q3392'>Nile</pl> to <pl id='Q11768'>Egypt</pl>. Mount <prn id='Q130135'>Atlas</prn> is so high that its peaks are said to touch heaven, but is inaccessible because of the water and the presence everywhere of trees. Its region indeed near the <pl id='Q1215696'>Nasamones</pl> is known, but we know of nobody yet who has sailed along the parts facing the sea. I must now resume. </p>
<p id='1.33.7'><b>1.33.7</b> Neither this nor any other ancient statue of <prn id='Q185747'>Nemesis</prn> has wings, for not even the holiest <prn id='Q693222'>xoana</prn> of the <pl id='Q1379299'>Smyrnaeans</pl> have them, but later artists, convinced that the goddess manifests herself most as a consequence of love, give wings to <prn id='Q185747'>Nemesis</prn> as they do to <prn id='Q121973'>Eros</prn>. I will now go onto describe what is figured on the pedestal of the <prn id='Q114296149'>statue</prn>, having made this preface for the sake of clearness. The Greeks say that <prn id='Q185747'>Nemesis</prn> was the mother of <prn id='Q164061'>Helen</prn>, while <prn id='Q182019'>Leda</prn> suckled and nursed her. The father of <prn id='Q164061'>Helen</prn> the Greeks like everybody else hold to be not <prn id='Q192946'>Tyndareus</prn> but <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.33.8'><b>1.33.8</b> Having heard this legend <prn id='Q177302'>Pheidias</prn> has represented <prn id='Q164061'>Helen</prn> as being led to <prn id='Q185747'>Nemesis</prn> by <prn id='Q182019'>Leda</prn>, and he has represented <prn id='Q192946'>Tyndareus</prn> and his children with a man HippeusYY by name standing by with a <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn>. There are <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn> and <prn id='Q171839'>Menelaus</prn> and <prn id='Q322639'>Pyrrhus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn> and first husband of <prn id='Q658523'>Hermione</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q164061'>Helen</prn>. <prn id='Q192407'>Orestes</prn> was passed over because of his crime against his mother, yet <prn id='Q658523'>Hermione</prn> stayed by his side in everything and bore him a child. Next upon the pedestal is one called <prn id='Q114295919'>Epochus</prn> and another youth; the only thing I heard about them was that they were brothers of <prn id='Q114295340'>Oenoe</prn>, from whom the <pl id='Q13423604'>deme</pl> has its name. </p>
<p id='1.34.1'><b>1.34.1</b> The land of <pl id='Q18073696'>Oropus</pl>, between <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl> and the land of <pl id='Q56259452'>Tanagra</pl>, which originally belonged to <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl>, in our time belongs to the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, who always fought for it but never won secure possession until <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn> gave it to them after taking <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>. The city is on the coast and affords nothing remarkable to record. About twelve stades from the city is a <pl id='Q474656'>sanctuary</pl> of <prn id='Q330584'>Amphiaraus</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.34.2'><b>1.34.2</b> Legend says that when <prn id='Q330584'>Amphiaraus</prn> was exiled from <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> the earth opened and swallowed both him and his chariot. Only they say that the incident did not happen here, the place called <pl id='Q57401086'>Harma</pl> (Chariot) being on the road from <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> to <pl id='Q21235810'>Chalcis</pl>. The divinity of <prn id='Q330584'>Amphiaraus</prn> was first established among the <pl id='Q18073696'>Oropians</pl>, from whom afterwards all the Greeks received the cult. I can enumerate other men also born at this time who are worshipped among the Greeks as gods; some even have cities dedicated to them, such as <pl id='Q1234913'>Eleus</pl> in <pl id='Q192860'>Chersonesus</pl> dedicated to <prn id='Q871361'>Protesilaus</prn>, and <pl id='Q11931280'>Lebadea</pl> of the <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotians</pl> dedicated to <prn id='Q1166183'>Trophonius</prn>. The <pl id='Q18073696'>Oropians</pl> have both a <pl id='Q474656'>temple</pl> and a white marble statue of <prn id='Q330584'>Amphiaraus</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.34.3'><b>1.34.3</b> The altar shows parts. One part is to <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, and <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> <prn id='Q107349763'>Paion</prn>, another is given up to heroes and to wives of heroes, the third is to <prn id='Q41419'>Hestia</prn> and <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> and <prn id='Q330584'>Amphiaraus</prn> and the children of <prn id='Q474888'>Amphilochus</prn>. But <prn id='Q591089'>Alcmaeon</prn>, because of his treatment of <prn id='Q1125040'>Eriphyle</prn>, is honored neither in the <pl id='Q474656'>shrine</pl> of <prn id='Q330584'>Amphiaraus</prn> nor yet with <prn id='Q474888'>Amphilochus</prn>. The fourth portion of the altar is to <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> and <prn id='Q850227'>Panacea</prn>, and further to <prn id='Q453201'>Iaso</prn>, <prn id='Q202257'>Health</prn> and <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> <prn id='Q107349741'>Paionia</prn>. The fifth is dedicated to the Nymphs and to <prn id='Q132582'>Pan</prn>, and to the rivers <prn id='Q391379'>Achelous</prn> and <prn id='Q1478704'>Cephisus</prn>. The <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> too have an altar to <prn id='Q474888'>Amphilochus</prn> in the city, and there is at <pl id='Q1425353'>Mallos</pl> in <pl id='Q620864'>Cilicia</pl> an oracle of his which is the most trustworthy of my day. </p>
<p id='1.34.4'><b>1.34.4</b> The <pl id='Q18073696'>Oropians</pl> have near the <pl id='Q474656'>temple</pl> a spring, which they call the Spring of <prn id='Q330584'>Amphiaraus</prn>; they neither sacrifice into it nor are wont to use it for purifications or for lustral water. But when a man has been cured of a disease through a response the custom is to throw silver and coined gold into the spring, for by this way they say that <prn id='Q330584'>Amphiaraus</prn> rose up after he had become a god. <prn id='Q123190782'>Iophon</prn> the <pl id='Q173527'>Cnossian</pl>, a guide, produced responses in hexameter verse, saying that <prn id='Q330584'>Amphiaraus</prn> gave them to the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> who were sent against <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>. These verses unrestrainedly appealed to popular taste. Except those whom they say <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> inspired of old none of the seers uttered oracles, but they were good at explaining dreams and interpreting the flights of birds and the entrails of victims. </p>
<p id='1.34.5'><b>1.34.5</b> My opinion is that <prn id='Q330584'>Amphiaraus</prn> devoted himself most to the exposition of dreams. It is manifest that, when his divinity was established, it was a dream oracle that he set up. One who has come to consult <prn id='Q330584'>Amphiaraus</prn> is wont first to purify himself. The mode of purification is to sacrifice to the god, and they sacrifice not only to him but also to all those whose names are on the altar. And when all these things have been first done, they sacrifice a ram, and, spreading the skin under them, go to sleep and await enlightenment in a dream. </p>
<p id='1.35.1'><b>1.35.1</b> There are islands not far from <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl>. Of the one called the <pl id='Q1145107'>Island of Patroclus</pl> I have already given an account. There is <pl id='Q618600'>another</pl> when you have sailed past <pl id='Q1136637'>Sunium</pl> with <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl> on the left. On this they say that <prn id='Q164061'>Helen</prn> landed after the capture of <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl>, </p>
<p id='1.35.2'><b>1.35.2</b> and for this reason the name of the island is <pl id='Q618600'>Helene</pl>. <pl id='Q202422'>Salamis</pl> lies over against <pl id='Q11918833'>Eleusis</pl>, and stretches as far as the territory of <pl id='Q42307600'>Megara</pl>. It is said that the first to give this name to the island was <prn id='Q679716'>Cychreus</prn>, who called it after his mother <prn id='Q2349443'>Salamis</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q622781'>Asopus</prn>, and afterwards it was colonized by the <pl id='Q191082'>Aeginetans</pl> with <prn id='Q331327'>Telamon</prn>. <prn id='Q1615450'>Philaeus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q1378566'>Eurysaces</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q172725'>Ajax</prn>, is said to have handed the island over to the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, having been made an <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> by them. Many years afterwards the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> drove out all the <pl id='Q202422'>Salaminians</pl>, having discovered that they had been guilty of treachery in the war with <prn id='Q207183'>Cassander</prn>, and mainly of set purpose had surrendered to the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl>. They sentenced to death <prn id='Q409566'>Aeschetades</prn>, who on this occasion had been elected general for <pl id='Q202422'>Salamis</pl>, and they swore never to forget the treachery of the <pl id='Q202422'>Salaminians</pl>. </p>
<p id='1.35.3'><b>1.35.3</b> There are still the remains of an agora, a temple of <prn id='Q172725'>Ajax</prn> and his statue in ebony. Even at the present day the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> pay honors to <prn id='Q172725'>Ajax</prn> himself and to <prn id='Q1378566'>Eurysaces</prn>, for there is an altar of <prn id='Q1378566'>Eurysaces</prn> also at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>. In <pl id='Q202422'>Salamis</pl> is shown a stone not far from the harbor, on which they say that <prn id='Q331327'>Telamon</prn> sat when he gazed at the ship in which his children were sailing away to <pl id='Q2612265'>Aulis</pl> to take part in the joint expedition of the Greeks. </p>
<p id='1.35.4'><b>1.35.4</b> Those who dwell about <pl id='Q202422'>Salamis</pl> say that it was when <prn id='Q172725'>Ajax</prn> died that the flower first appeared in their country. It is white and tinged with red, both flower and leaves being smaller than those of the lily; there are letters on it like to those on the iris. About the judgment concerning the armour I heard a story of the <pl id='Q255325'>Aeolians</pl> who afterwards settled at <pl id='Q22647'>Ilium</pl>, to the effect that when <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn> suffered shipwreck the armour was cast ashore near the grave of <prn id='Q172725'>Ajax</prn>. As to the hero's size, a <pl id='Q622319'>Mysian</pl> was my informant. </p>
<p id='1.35.5'><b>1.35.5</b> He said that the sea flooded the side of the grave facing the beach and made it easy to enter the tomb, and he bade me form an estimate of the size of the corpse in the following way. The bones on his knees, called by doctors the knee-pan, were in the case of <prn id='Q172725'>Ajax</prn> as big as the quoit of a boy in the pentathlon. I saw nothing to wonder at in the stature of those <pl id='Q35966'>Celts</pl> who live farthest of on the borders of the land which is uninhabited because of the cold; these people, the <pl id='Q2873438'>Cabares</pl>, are no bigger than <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptian</pl> corpses. But I will relate all that appeared to me worth seeing. </p>
<p id='1.35.6'><b>1.35.6</b> For the <pl id='Q1432674'>Magnesians</pl> on the Lethaeus, <prn id='Q22132584'>Protophanes</prn>, one of the citizens, won at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> in one day victories in the pancration and in wrestling. Into the grave of this man robbers entered, thinking to gain some advantage, and after the robbers people came in to see the corpse, which had ribs not separated but joined together from the shoulders to the smallest ribs, those called by doctors bastard. Before the city of the <pl id='Q169460'>Milesians</pl> is an island called Lade, and from it certain islets are detached. One of these they call the islet of <prn id='Q10420712'>Asterius</prn>, and say that <prn id='Q10420712'>Asterius</prn> was buried in it, and that <prn id='Q10420712'>Asterius</prn> was the son of <prn id='Q2303713'>Anax</prn>, and <prn id='Q2303713'>Anax</prn> the son of <prn id='Q93172'>Earth</prn>. Now the corpse is not less than ten cubits. </p>
<p id='1.35.7'><b>1.35.7</b> But what really caused me surprise is this. There is a small city of upper <pl id='Q620765'>Lydia</pl> called <prn id='Q85805515'>Temenou Thyrai</prn> (Doors of Temenos). There a hill ruptured in a storm, and there appeared bones the shape of which led one to suppose that they were human, but from their size one would never have thought it. At once the story spread among the multitude that it was the corpse of <prn id='Q86805'>Geryon</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q320660'>Chrysaor</prn>, and that the seat also was his. For there is a man's seat carved on a rocky spur of the mountain. And a torrent they called the river Ocean, and they said that men ploughing met with the horns of <prn id='Q830'>cattle</prn>, for the story is that <prn id='Q86805'>Geryon</prn> reared excellent <prn id='Q830'>cows</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.35.8'><b>1.35.8</b> And when I criticized the account and pointed out to them that <prn id='Q86805'>Geryon</prn> is at <pl id='Q5890310'>Gadeira</pl>, where there is, not his tomb, but a tree showing different shapes, the guides of the <pl id='Q620765'>Lydians</pl> related the true story, that the corpse is that of <prn id='Q847268'>Hyllus</prn>, a son of <prn id='Q93172'>Earth</prn>, from whom the river is named. They also said that <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> from his sojourning with <prn id='Q486698'>Omphale</prn> called his son <prn id='Q847268'>Hyllus</prn> after the river. </p>
<p id='1.36.1'><b>1.36.1</b> But I will return to my subject. In <pl id='Q202422'>Salamis</pl> is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, and also a trophy erected in honor of the victory which <prn id='Q179552'>Themistocles</prn> the son of <prn id='Q107138602'>Neocles</prn> won for the Greeks. There is also a sanctuary of <prn id='Q679716'>Cychreus</prn>. When the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> were fighting the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl> at sea, a <prn id='Q2102'>serpent</prn> is said to have appeared in the fleet, and the god in an oracle told the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> that it was <prn id='Q679716'>Cychreus</prn> the hero. </p>
<p id='1.36.2'><b>1.36.2</b> Before <pl id='Q202422'>Salamis</pl> there is an island called <pl id='Q2031588'>Psyttalea</pl>. Here they say that about four hundred of the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl> landed, and when the fleet of <prn id='Q129165'>Xerxes</prn> was defeated, these also were killed after the Greeks had crossed over to <pl id='Q2031588'>Psyttalea</pl>. The island has no artistic statue, only some roughly carved <prn id='Q693222'>xoana</prn> of <prn id='Q132582'>Pan</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.36.3'><b>1.36.3</b> As you go to <pl id='Q11918833'>Eleusis</pl> from <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> along what the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> call the <pl id='Q38279588'>Sacred Way</pl> you see the tomb of <prn id='Q109486108'>Anthemocritus</prn>. The <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarians</pl> committed against him a most wicked deed, for when he had come as a herald to forbid them to encroach upon the land in future they put him to death. For this act the wrath of the <prn id='Q30025797'>Two Goddesses</prn> lies upon them even to this day, for they are the only Greeks that not even the emperor <prn id='Q1427'>Hadrian</prn> could make more prosperous. </p>
<p id='1.36.4'><b>1.36.4</b> After that of <prn id='Q109486108'>Anthemocritus</prn> comes the stele of <prn id='Q114289474'>Molottus</prn>, who was deemed worthy of commanding the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> when they crossed into <pl id='Q173096'>Euboea</pl> to reinforce <prn id='Q1562025'>Plutarch</prn>, and also a place called <prn id='Q60790836'>Skiron</prn>, which received its name for the following reason. The <pl id='Q11918833'>Eleusinians</pl> were making war against <prn id='Q301219'>Erechtheus</prn> when there came from <pl id='Q382317'>Dodona</pl> a seer called <prn id='Q16328418'>Skiros</prn>, who also set up at <pl id='Q534927'>Phalerum</pl> the ancient sanctuary of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> <prn id='Q107326431'>Sciras</prn>. When he fell in the fighting the <pl id='Q11918833'>Eleusinians</pl> buried him near a winter torrent, and the hero has given his name to both <prn id='Q60790836'>place</prn> and torrent. </p>
<p id='1.36.5'><b>1.36.5</b> Hard by is the monument of <prn id='Q85031200'>Cephisodorus</prn>, who was champion of the people and opposed to the utmost <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q878405'>Demetrius</prn>, king of <pl id='Q81734'>Macedon</pl>. <prn id='Q85031200'>Cephisodorus</prn> induced to become allies of <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> two kings, <prn id='Q110745'>Attalus</prn> the <pl id='Q622319'>Mysian</pl> and <prn id='Q39576'>Ptolemy</prn> the <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptian</pl>, and, of the self-governing peoples, the <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolians</pl> with the <pl id='Q13533316'>Rhodians</pl> and the <pl id='Q4752820'>Cretans</pl> among the islanders. </p>
<p id='1.36.6'><b>1.36.6</b> As the reinforcements from <pl id='Q11768'>Egypt</pl>, <pl id='Q622319'>Mysia</pl>, and <pl id='Q4752820'>Crete</pl> were for the most part too late, and the <pl id='Q13533316'>Rhodians</pl>, whose strength lay only in their fleet, were of little help against the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonian</pl> men-at-arms, <prn id='Q85031200'>Cephisodorus</prn> sailed with other <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> to <pl id='Q913582'>Italy</pl> and begged aid of the Romans. They sent a force and a general, who so reduced <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn> and the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> that afterwards <prn id='Q207363'>Perseus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn>, lost his throne and was himself taken prisoner to <pl id='Q913582'>Italy</pl>. This <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn> was the son of <prn id='Q878405'>Demetrius</prn>. <prn id='Q878405'>Demetrius</prn> was the first of this house to hold the throne of <pl id='Q81734'>Macedon</pl>, having put to death <prn id='Q347170'>Alexander</prn>, son of <prn id='Q207183'>Cassander</prn>, as I have related in a former part of my account. </p>
<p id='1.37.1'><b>1.37.1</b> After the monument of <prn id='Q85031200'>Cephisodorus</prn> is buried <prn id='Q114298340'>Heliodorus Halis</prn>. A portrait of this man is also to be seen in the <pl id='Q10288'>great temple</pl> of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>. Here too is the grave of <prn id='Q114298468'>Themistocles son of Poliarchus</prn>, grandson of the <prn id='Q179552'>Themistocles</prn> who fought the sea fight against <prn id='Q129165'>Xerxes</prn> and the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl>. Of the later descendants I shall mention none except <prn id='Q50213338'>Akestion</prn>. She, her father XenoclesYY, his father Sophocles, and his father LeonYY, all of them up to her great-grandfather LeonYY won the honor of being torch-bearer, and in her own lifetime she saw as torch-bearers, first her brother Sophocles, after him her husband <prn id='Q114298468'>Themistocles</prn>, and after his death her son <prn id='Q160362'>Theophrastus</prn>. Such was the fortune, they say, that happened to her. </p>
<p id='1.37.2'><b>1.37.2</b> A little way past here is a precinct sacred to <prn id='Q4253285'>Lakios</prn>, a hero, a deme called after him <pl id='Q13427353'>Lakiadai</pl>, and the tomb of <prn id='Q50375819'>Nikokles</prn> of <pl id='Q3981082'>Tarentum</pl>, who won a unique reputation as a kitharode. There is also an altar of <prn id='Q467515'>Zephyrus</prn> and a sanctuary of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> and her daughter. With them <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> and <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> are honored. There is a legend that in this place <prn id='Q2395266'>Phytalus</prn> welcomed <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> in his home, for which act the goddess gave him the fig tree. This story is borne out by the inscription on the tomb of <prn id='Q2395266'>Phytalus</prn>: <br>“Hero and king, <prn id='Q2395266'>Phytalus</prn> here welcome gave to <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>,<br>August goddess, when first she created fruit of the harvest; <br>Sacred fig is the name which mortal men have assigned it. <br>Whence <prn id='Q2395266'>Phytalus</prn> and his race have gotten honours immortal.” </p>
<p id='1.37.3'><b>1.37.3</b> Before you cross the <pl id='Q1235405'>Cephisus</pl> you come to the monument of <prn id='Q21936653'>Theodorus</prn>, the best tragic actor of his day. By the river is a statue of A1487, and a votive statue of her son cutting his hair as a gift for <pl id='Q1235405'>Cephisus</pl>. That this habit has existed from ancient times among all the Greeks may be inferred from the poetry of <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>, who makes <prn id='Q178641'>Peleus</prn> vow that on the safe return of <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn> from <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl> he will cut off the young man's hair as a gift for the <pl id='Q426309'>Spercheus</pl>. </p>
<p id='1.37.4'><b>1.37.4</b> Across the <pl id='Q1235405'>Cephisus</pl> is an ancient altar of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q1637673'>Meilichius</prn> (Gracious).

They say that he was a skilful physician and dedicated statues, among which is a representation of <prn id='Q690603'>Iacchus</prn>. On the road stands a small temple called that of <prn id='Q5197359'>Cyamites</prn>. I cannot state for certain whether he was the first to sow beans, or whether they gave this name to a hero because they may not attribute to <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> the discovery of beans. Whoever has been initiated at <pl id='Q94299853'>Eleusis</pl> or has read what are called the <prn id='Q1313790'>Orphica</prn> knows what I mean. </p>
<p id='1.37.5'><b>1.37.5</b> Of the tombs, the largest and most beautiful are that of a <pl id='Q13533316'>Rhodian</pl> who settled at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, and the one made by the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonian</pl> <prn id='Q462994'>Harpalus</prn>, who ran away from <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn> and crossed with a fleet from <prn id='Q48'>Asia</prn> to Europe. On his arrival at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> he was arrested by the citizens, but ran away after bribing among others the friends of <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn>. But before this he married <prn id='Q659368'>Pythionice</prn>, whose family I do not know, but she was a courtesan at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> and at <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl>. His love for her was so great that when she died he made her a <pl id='Q13436271'>tomb</pl> which is the most noteworthy of all the old Greek tombs. </p>
<p id='1.37.6'><b>1.37.6</b> There is a <pl id='Q500444'>sanctuary</pl> in which are set statues of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>, her daughter, <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, and <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>. At the first it was built in honor of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> only. For legend says that <prn id='Q643504'>Cephalus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q1183342'>Deion</prn>, having helped <prn id='Q206214'>Amphitryon</prn> to destroy the <prn id='Q7695763'>Teleboans</prn>, was the first to dwell in that island which now is called after him <pl id='Q178488'>Cephallenia</pl>, and that he resided till that time at <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>, exiled from <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> because he had killed his wife <prn id='Q1139470'>Procris</prn>. In the tenth generation afterwards Chalcinus and <prn id='Q4154093'>Daetus</prn>, descendants of <prn id='Q643504'>Cephalus</prn>, sailed to <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> and asked the god for permission to return to <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>. </p>
<p id='1.37.7'><b>1.37.7</b> He ordered them first to sacrifice to <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> in that spot in <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl> where they should see a trireme running on the land. When they reached the mountain called <pl id='Q1296693'>Poikilon</pl> a <prn id='Q2102'>snake</prn> was seen hurrying into its hole. In this place they sacrificed to <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>; afterwards they came to <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> and the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> made them citizens. After this is a <pl id='Q21556409'>temple</pl> of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>, before which is a noteworthy wall of unworked stone. </p>
<p id='1.38.1'><b>1.38.1</b> The streams called Rheiti are rivers only in so far as they are currents, for their water is sea water. It is a reasonable belief that they flow beneath the ground from the <pl id='Q1137741'>Euripus</pl> of the <pl id='Q21235810'>Chalcidians</pl>, and fall into a sea of a lower level. They are said to be sacred to <prn id='Q45967'>Kore</prn> and to <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>, and only the priests of these goddesses are permitted to catch the fish in them. Anciently, I learn, these streams were the boundaries between the land of the <pl id='Q11918833'>Eleusinians</pl> and that of the other <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, </p>
<p id='1.38.2'><b>1.38.2</b> and the first to dwell on the other side of the Rheiti was <prn id='Q3698275'>Crocon</prn>, where at the present day is what is called the Basileia (palace) of <prn id='Q3698275'>Crocon</prn>. This <prn id='Q3698275'>Crocon</prn> the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> say married <prn id='Q16328138'>Saesara</prn>, daughter of <prn id='Q1141300'>Celeus</prn>. Not all of them say this, but only those who belong to the deme of <pl id='Q13464949'>Scambonidae</pl>. I could not find the grave of <prn id='Q3698275'>Crocon</prn>, but <pl id='Q11918833'>Eleusinians</pl> and <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> agreed in identifying the tomb of <prn id='Q1125049'>Eumolpus</prn>. This <prn id='Q1125049'>Eumolpus</prn> they say came from <pl id='Q41741'>Thrace</pl>, being the son of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> and <prn id='Q7382381'>Chione</prn>. <prn id='Q7382381'>Chione</prn> they say was the daughter of the wind <prn id='Q109220'>Boreas</prn> and of <prn id='Q1129489'>Oreithyia</prn>. <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> says nothing about the family of <prn id='Q1125049'>Eumolpus</prn>, but in his poems styles him “manly.” </p>
<p id='1.38.3'><b>1.38.3</b> When the <pl id='Q11918833'>Eleusinians</pl> fought with the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, <prn id='Q301219'>Erechtheus</prn>, king of the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, was killed, as was also <prn id='Q4200286'>Immaradus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q1125049'>Eumolpus</prn>. These were the terms on which they concluded the war: the <pl id='Q11918833'>Eleusinians</pl> were to have independent control of the <prn id='Q26314'>Mysteries</prn>, but in all things else were to be subject to the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>. The ministers of the <prn id='Q30025797'>Two Goddesses</prn> were <prn id='Q1125049'>Eumolpus</prn> and the daughters of <prn id='Q1141300'>Celeus</prn>, whom <prn id='Q11939948'>Pamphos</prn> and <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> agree in naming <prn id='Q4161961'>Diogenia</prn>, <prn id='Q114289252'>Pammerope</prn>, and the third <prn id='Q16328138'>Saesara</prn>. <prn id='Q1125049'>Eumolpus</prn> was survived by <prn id='Q977434'>Ceryx</prn>, the younger of his sons whom the <prn id='Q16545569'>Ceryces</prn> themselves say was a son of <prn id='Q584492'>Aglaurus</prn>, daughter of <prn id='Q500739'>Cecrops</prn>, and of <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn>, not of <prn id='Q1125049'>Eumolpus</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.38.4'><b>1.38.4</b> There is also a heroon of <prn id='Q1304531'>Hippothoon</prn>, after whom the tribe is named, and hard by one of <prn id='Q119853881'>Zarex</prn>. The latter they say learned music from <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, but my opinion is that he was a <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> who came as a stranger to the land, and that after him is named <pl id='Q11955563'>Zarax</pl>, a town in the <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconian</pl> territory near the sea. If there is a native <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> hero called <prn id='Q4187165'>Zarex</prn>, I have nothing to say concerning him. </p>
<p id='1.38.5'><b>1.38.5</b> At <pl id='Q11918833'>Eleusis</pl> flows a Cephisus which is more violent than the <pl id='Q1235405'>Cephisus</pl> I mentioned above, and by the side of it is the place they call Erineon, saying that <prn id='Q152262'>Plouton</prn> descended there to the lower world after carrying off <prn id='Q45967'>Kore</prn>. Near this Cephisus <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> killed a brigand named <prn id='Q271949'>Polypemon</prn> and surnamed <prn id='Q271949'>Procrustes</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.38.6'><b>1.38.6</b> The <pl id='Q11918833'>Eleusinians</pl> have a temple of <prn id='Q269243'>Triptolemus</prn>, and another of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> Propylaia and Father <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, and a well called <prn id='Q110276236'>Callichoron</prn> (Lovely dance), where first the women of the <pl id='Q11918833'>Eleusinians</pl> danced and sang in praise of the goddess. They say that the plain called <pl id='Q2750628'>Rharium</pl> was the first to be sown and the first to grow crops, and for this reason it is the custom to use sacrificial barley and to make cakes for the sacrifices from its produce. Here there is shown a threshing-floor called that of <prn id='Q269243'>Triptolemus</prn> and an altar. </p>
<p id='1.38.7'><b>1.38.7</b> My dream forbade the description of the things within the wall of the sanctuary, and the uninitiated are of course not permitted to learn that which they are prevented from seeing. The hero <prn id='Q1328260'>Eleusis</prn>, after whom the city is named, some assert to be a son of <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> and of <prn id='Q4154083'>Daeira</prn>, daughter of <prn id='Q161419'>Ocean</prn>; there are poets, however, who have made <prn id='Q1142802'>Ogygus</prn> father of <prn id='Q1328260'>Eleusis</prn>. Ancient legends, deprived of the help of poetry, have given rise to many fictions, especially concerning the pedigrees of heroes. </p>
<p id='1.38.8'><b>1.38.8</b> When you have turned from <pl id='Q11918833'>Eleusis</pl> to <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl> you come to the <pl id='Q742538'>Plataean</pl> land, which borders on <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl>. Formerly <pl id='Q1328318'>Eleutherae</pl> formed the boundary on the side towards <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl>, but when it came over to the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> henceforth the boundary of <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl> was <pl id='Q1147780'>Cithaeron</pl>. The reason why the people of <pl id='Q1328318'>Eleutherae</pl> came over was not because they were reduced by war, but because they desired to share <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> citizenship and hated the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl>. In this plain is a temple of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>, from which the old wooden image was carried off to <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>. The image at <pl id='Q1328318'>Eleutherae</pl> at the present day is a copy of the old one. </p>
<p id='1.38.9'><b>1.38.9</b> A little farther on is a small cave, and beside it is a spring of cold water. The legend about the cave is that <prn id='Q461439'>Antiope</prn> after her labour placed her babies into it; as to the spring, it is said that the shepherd who found the babies washed them there for the first time, taking off their swaddling clothes. Of <pl id='Q1328318'>Eleutherae</pl> there were still left the ruins of the wall and of the houses. From these it is clear that the city was built a little above the plain close to <pl id='Q1147780'>Cithaeron</pl>. </p>
<p id='1.39.1'><b>1.39.1</b> There is another road from <pl id='Q11918833'>Eleusis</pl>, which leads to <pl id='Q42307600'>Megara</pl>. As you go along this road you come to a well called Anthium (Flowery Well). <prn id='Q11939948'>Pamphos</prn> in his poems describes how <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> in the likeness of an old woman sat at this well after the rape of her daughter, how the daughters of <prn id='Q1141300'>Celeus</prn> thence took her as an <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl> woman to their mother, and how <prn id='Q1469456'>Metaneira</prn> thereupon entrusted to her the rearing of her son. </p>
<p id='1.39.2'><b>1.39.2</b> A little farther on from the well is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q1469456'>Metaneira</prn>, and after it are graves of <prn id='Q3119061'>those who went against</prn> <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>. For <prn id='Q732066'>Creon</prn>, who at that time ruled in <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> as guardian of <prn id='Q765456'>Laodamas</prn> the son of <prn id='Q506550'>Eteocles</prn>, refused to allow the relatives to take up and bury their dead. But <prn id='Q223152'>Adrastus</prn> having supplicated <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>, the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> fought with the <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotians</pl>, and <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> being victorious in the fight carried the dead to the <pl id='Q11918833'>Eleusinian</pl> territory and buried them here. The <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl>, however, say that they voluntarily gave up the dead for burial and deny that they engaged in battle. </p>
<p id='1.39.3'><b>1.39.3</b> After the graves of the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> is the tomb of <prn id='Q657562'>Alope</prn>, who, legend says, being mother of <prn id='Q1304531'>Hippothoon</prn> by <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> was on this spot put to death by her father <prn id='Q1349772'>Cercyon</prn>. He is said to have treated strangers wickedly, especially in wrestling with them against their will. So even to my day this place is called the Palaistra of <prn id='Q1349772'>Cercyon</prn>, being a little way from the grave of <prn id='Q657562'>Alope</prn>. <prn id='Q1349772'>Cercyon</prn> is said to have killed all those who tried a bout with him except <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>, who out matched him mainly by his skill. For <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> was the first to discover the art of wrestling, and through him afterwards was established the teaching of the art. Before him men used in wrestling only size and strength of body. Such in my opinion are the most famous legends and sights among the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, and from the beginning my narrative has picked out of much material the things that deserve to be recorded. </p>
<p id='1.39.4'><b>1.39.4</b> Next to <pl id='Q11918833'>Eleusis</pl> is the district called <pl id='Q42307600'>Megaris</pl>. This too belonged to <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> in ancient times, <prn id='Q3411223'>Pylas</prn> the king having left it to <prn id='Q1076578'>Pandion</prn>. My evidence is this; in the land is the grave of <prn id='Q1076578'>Pandion</prn>, and <prn id='Q1136201'>Nisus</prn>, while giving up the rule over the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> to <prn id='Q191725'>Aegeus</prn>, the eldest of all the family, was himself made king of <pl id='Q42307600'>Megara</pl> and of the territory as far as <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl>. Even at the present day the port of the <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarians</pl> is called <pl id='Q2537089'>Nisaea</pl> after him. Subsequently in the reign of <prn id='Q1052888'>Codrus</prn> the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesians</pl> made an expedition against <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>. Having accomplished nothing brilliant, on their way home they took <pl id='Q42307600'>Megara</pl> from the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, and gave it as a dwelling-place to such of the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthians</pl> and of their other allies as wished to go there. </p>
<p id='1.39.5'><b>1.39.5</b> In this way the <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarians</pl> changed their customs and dialect and became <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn>, and they say that the city received its name when <prn id='Q1728858'>Car</prn> the son of <prn id='Q649624'>Phoroneus</prn> was king in this land. It was then they say that sanctuaries of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> were first made by them, and then that men used the name <pl id='Q42307600'>Megara</pl> (Chambers). This is their history according to the <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarians</pl> themselves. But the <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotians</pl> declare that <prn id='Q247446'>Megareus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, who dwelt in <pl id='Q3063303'>Onchestus</pl>, came with an army of <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotians</pl> to help <prn id='Q1136201'>Nisus</prn> wage the war against <prn id='Q23168'>Minos</prn>; that falling in the battle he was buried on the spot, and the city was named <pl id='Q42307600'>Megara</pl> from him, having previously been called Nisa. </p>
<p id='1.39.6'><b>1.39.6</b> In the twelfth generation after <prn id='Q1728858'>Car</prn> the son of <prn id='Q649624'>Phoroneus</prn> the <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarians</pl> say that <prn id='Q1657298'>Lelex</prn> arrived from <pl id='Q11768'>Egypt</pl> and became king, and that in his reign the tribe <pl id='Q375221'>Leleges</pl> received its name. <prn id='Q1657298'>Lelex</prn> they say begat <prn id='Q2980787'>Cleson</prn>, <prn id='Q2980787'>Cleson</prn> <prn id='Q3411223'>Pylas</prn> and <prn id='Q3411223'>Pylas</prn> <prn id='Q1469237'>Sciron</prn>, who married the daughter of <prn id='Q1076578'>Pandion</prn> and afterwards disputed with <prn id='Q1136201'>Nisus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q1076578'>Pandion</prn>, about the throne, the dispute being settled by <prn id='Q206187'>Aeacus</prn>, who gave the kingship to <prn id='Q1136201'>Nisus</prn> and his descendants, and to <prn id='Q1469237'>Sciron</prn> the leadership in war. They say further that <prn id='Q1136201'>Nisus</prn> was succeeded by <prn id='Q247446'>Megareus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, who married <prn id='Q12878271'>Iphinoe</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q1136201'>Nisus</prn>, but they ignore altogether the <pl id='Q4752820'>Cretan</pl> war and the capture of the city in the reign of <prn id='Q1136201'>Nisus</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.40.1'><b>1.40.1</b> There is in the city a <pl id='Q16330803'>fountain</pl>, which was built for the citizens by <prn id='Q183495'>Theagenes</prn>, whom I have mentioned previously as having given his daughter in marriage to <prn id='Q433466'>Cylon</prn> the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl>. This <prn id='Q183495'>Theagenes</prn> upon becoming tyrant built the fountain, which is noteworthy for its size, beauty and the number of its pillars. Water flows into it called the water of the <prn id='Q107315219'>Sithnid</prn> nymphs. The <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarians</pl> say that the <prn id='Q107315219'>Sithnid</prn> nymphs are native, and that one of them mated with <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>; that <prn id='Q1917132'>Megarus</prn>, a son of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> and of this nymph, escaped the flood in the time of <prn id='Q207715'>Deucalion</prn>, and made his escape to the heights of <pl id='Q749507'>Gerania</pl>. The mountain had not yet received this name, but was then named <pl id='Q749507'>Gerania</pl> (Crane Hill) because cranes were flying and <prn id='Q1917132'>Megarus</prn> swam towards the cry of the birds. </p>
<p id='1.40.2'><b>1.40.2</b> Not far from this fountain is an ancient sanctuary, and in our day likenesses stand in it of Roman emperors, and a bronze image is there of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> surnamed <prn id='Q2303797'>Saviour</prn>. There is a story that a detachment of the army of <prn id='Q155063'>Mardonius</prn>, having overrun <pl id='Q42307600'>Megaris</pl>, wished to return to <prn id='Q155063'>Mardonius</prn> at <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>, but that by the will of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> night came on them as they marched, and missing their way they turned into the hilly region. Trying to find out whether there was a hostile force near they shot some missiles. The rock near groaned when struck, and they shot again with greater eagerness, </p>
<p id='1.40.3'><b>1.40.3</b> until at last they used up all their arrows thinking that they were shooting at the enemy. When the day broke, the <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarians</pl> attacked, and being men in armour fighting against men without armour who no longer had even a supply of missiles, they killed the greater number of their opponents. For this reason they had an image made of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> <prn id='Q2303797'>Saviour</prn>. Here are also images of the gods named the Twelve, said to be the work of <prn id='Q105290'>Praxiteles</prn>. But the image of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> herself was made by <prn id='Q3976117'>Strongylion</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.40.4'><b>1.40.4</b> After this when you have entered the precinct of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> called the Olympieum you see a noteworthy temple. But the image of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> was not finished, for the work was interrupted by the war of the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesians</pl> against the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, in which the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> every year ravaged the land of the <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarians</pl> with a fleet and an army, damaging public revenues and bringing private families to dire distress. The face of the image of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> is of ivory and gold, the other parts are of clay and gypsum. The artist is said to have been <prn id='Q15445359'>Theocosmus</prn>, a native, helped by <prn id='Q177302'>Pheidias</prn>. Above the head of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> are the <prn id='Q201411'>Seasons</prn> and <prn id='Q180287'>Fates</prn>, and all may see that he is the only god obeyed by Destiny, and that he apportions the seasons as is due. Behind the temple lie half-worked pieces of wood, which <prn id='Q15445359'>Theocosmus</prn> intended to overlay with ivory and gold in order a complete the image of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.40.5'><b>1.40.5</b> In the temple itself is dedicated a bronze ram of a galley. This ship they say that they captured off <pl id='Q202422'>Salamis</pl> in a naval action with the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>. The <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> too admit that for a time they evacuated the island before the <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarians</pl>, saying that afterwards <prn id='Q133337'>Solon</prn> wrote elegiac poems and encouraged them, and that thereupon the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> challenged their enemies, won the war and recovered <pl id='Q202422'>Salamis</pl>. But the <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarians</pl> say that exiles from themselves, whom they call Dorycleans, reached the colonists in <pl id='Q202422'>Salamis</pl> and betrayed the island to the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>. </p>
<p id='1.40.6'><b>1.40.6</b> After the precinct of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, when you have ascended the acropolis, which even at the present day is called Caria from <prn id='Q1728858'>Car</prn>, son of <prn id='Q649624'>Phoroneus</prn>, you see a temple of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> <prn id='Q107315306'>Nyctelius</prn> (Nocturnal), a sanctuary built to <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> <prn id='Q60504087'>Epistrophia</prn> (She who turns men to love), an oracle called that of <prn id='Q131203'>Night</prn> and a temple of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q58618672'>Conius</prn> (Dusty) without a roof. The image of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> and also that of <prn id='Q202257'>Health</prn> were made by <prn id='Q122196'>Bryaxis</prn>. Here too is what is called the Megaron of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>, built, they say, by <prn id='Q1728858'>Car</prn> when he was king. </p>
<p id='1.41.1'><b>1.41.1</b> On coming down from the acropolis, where the ground turns northwards, is the tomb of <prn id='Q190543'>Alcmena</prn>, near the Olympieum. They say that as she was walking from <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> to <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> she died on the way at <pl id='Q42307600'>Megara</pl>, and that the <prn id='Q828084'>Heracleidae</prn> fell to disputing, some wishing to carry the corpse of <prn id='Q190543'>Alcmena</prn> back to <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>, others wishing to take it to <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>, as in <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> were buried <prn id='Q206214'>Amphitryon</prn> and the children of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> by <prn id='Q929768'>Megara</prn>. But the god in <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> gave them an oracle that it was better for them to bury <prn id='Q190543'>Alcmena</prn> in <pl id='Q42307600'>Megara</pl>. </p>
<p id='1.41.2'><b>1.41.2</b> From this place the local guide took us to a place which he said was named Rhus (Stream), for that water once flowed here from the mountains above the city. But <prn id='Q183495'>Theagenes</prn>, who was tyrant at that time, turned the water into another direction and made here an altar to <prn id='Q391379'>Achelous</prn>. Hard by is the tomb of <prn id='Q847268'>Hyllus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, who fought a duel with an <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadian</pl>, <prn id='Q2993260'>Echemus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q4058052'>Aeropus</prn>. Who the <prn id='Q2993260'>Echemus</prn> was who killed <prn id='Q847268'>Hyllus</prn> I will tell in another part of my narrative, but <prn id='Q847268'>Hyllus</prn> also is buried at <pl id='Q42307600'>Megara</pl>. These events might correctly be called an expedition of the <prn id='Q828084'>Heracleidae</prn> into the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl> in the reign of <prn id='Q192407'>Orestes</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.41.3'><b>1.41.3</b> Not far from the tomb of <prn id='Q847268'>Hyllus</prn> is a temple of <prn id='Q79876'>Isis</prn>, and beside it one of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> and of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>. They say that <prn id='Q1417968'>Alcathous</prn> made it after killing the <prn id='Q1743879'>lion</prn> called <pl id='Q1147780'>Cithaeronian</pl>. By this <prn id='Q140'>lion</prn> they say many were slain, including <prn id='Q51476625'>Euippus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q247446'>Megareus</prn> their king, whose elder son <prn id='Q247446'>Timalcus</prn> had before this been killed by <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> while on a campaign with the <prn id='Q190103'>Dioscuri</prn> against <pl id='Q618453'>Aphidna</pl>. <prn id='Q247446'>Megareus</prn> they say promised that he who killed the <pl id='Q1147780'>Cithaeronian</pl> <prn id='Q1743879'>lion</prn> should marry his daughter and succeed him in the kingdom. <prn id='Q1417968'>Alcathous</prn> therefore, son of <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn>, attacked the beast and overcame it, and when he came to the throne he built this sanctuary, surnaming <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> <prn id='Q1458788'>Agrotera</prn> (Huntress) and <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> <prn id='Q21548142'>Agraeus</prn> (Hunter). </p>
<p id='1.41.4'><b>1.41.4</b> Such is the account of the <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarians</pl>; but although I wish my account to agree with theirs, yet I cannot accept everything they say. I am ready to believe that a <prn id='Q140'>lion</prn> was killed by <prn id='Q1417968'>Alcathous</prn> on <pl id='Q1147780'>Cithaeron</pl>, but what historian has recorded that <prn id='Q247446'>Timalcus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q247446'>Megareus</prn> came with the <prn id='Q190103'>Dioscuri</prn> to <pl id='Q618453'>Aphidna</pl>? And supposing he had gone there, how could one hold that he had been killed by <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>, when <prn id='Q298850'>Alcman</prn> wrote a poem on the <prn id='Q190103'>Dioscuri</prn>, in which he says that they captured <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> and carried into captivity the mother of <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>, but <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> himself was absent? </p>
<p id='1.41.5'><b>1.41.5</b> <prn id='Q134929'>Pindar</prn> in his poems agrees with this account, saying that <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>, wishing to be related to the <prn id='Q190103'>Dioscuri</prn>, carried off <prn id='Q164061'>Helen</prn> and kept her until he departed to carry out with <prn id='Q502156'>Peirithous</prn> the marriage that they tell of. Whoever has studied genealogy finds the <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarians</pl> guilty of great silliness, since <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> was a descendant of <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn>. The fact is that the <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarians</pl> know the true story but conceal it, not wishing it to be thought that their city was captured in the reign of <prn id='Q1136201'>Nisus</prn>, but that both <prn id='Q247446'>Megareus</prn>, the son-in-law of <prn id='Q1136201'>Nisus</prn>, and <prn id='Q1417968'>Alcathous</prn>, the son-in-law of <prn id='Q247446'>Megareus</prn>, succeeded their respective fathers-in-law as king. </p>
<p id='1.41.6'><b>1.41.6</b> It is evident that <prn id='Q1417968'>Alcathous</prn> arrived from <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> just at the time when <prn id='Q1136201'>Nisus</prn> had died and the <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarians</pl> had lost everything. Witness to the truth of my statements the fact that he built the wall afresh from the beginning, the old one round the city having been destroyed by the <pl id='Q4752820'>Cretans</pl>. Let so much suffice for <prn id='Q1417968'>Alcathous</prn> and for the <prn id='Q140'>lion</prn>, whether it was on <pl id='Q1147780'>Cithaeron</pl> or elsewhere that the killing took place that caused him to make a temple to <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> <prn id='Q1458788'>Agrotera</prn> and <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> <prn id='Q21548142'>Agraeus</prn>. On going down from this sanctuary you see the shrine of the hero <prn id='Q1076578'>Pandion</prn>. My narrative has already told how <prn id='Q1076578'>Pandion</prn> was buried on what is called the Rock of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> <prn id='Q21548073'>Aethyia</prn> (Gannet). He receives honors from the <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarians</pl> in the city as well. </p>
<p id='1.41.7'><b>1.41.7</b> Near the shrine of the hero <prn id='Q1076578'>Pandion</prn> is the tomb of <prn id='Q210303'>Hippolyte</prn>. I will record the account the <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarians</pl> give of her. When the <prn id='Q134154'>Amazons</prn>, having marched against the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> because of <prn id='Q580862'>Antiope</prn>, were overcome by <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>, most of them met their death in the fight, but <prn id='Q210303'>Hippolyte</prn>, the sister of <prn id='Q580862'>Antiope</prn> and on this occasion the leader of the women, escaped with a few others to <pl id='Q42307600'>Megara</pl>. Having suffered such a military disaster, being in despair at her present situation and even more hopeless of reaching her home in <pl id='Q122875'>Themiscyra</pl>, she died of a broken heart, and the <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarians</pl> gave her burial. The shape of her tomb is like an Amazonian shield. </p>
<p id='1.41.8'><b>1.41.8</b> Not far from this is the grave of <prn id='Q1138506'>Tereus</prn>, who married <prn id='Q1231743'>Procne</prn> the daughter of <prn id='Q1076578'>Pandion</prn>. The <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarians</pl> say that <prn id='Q1138506'>Tereus</prn> was king of the region around what is called <pl id='Q935675'>Pagae</pl> (Springs) of <pl id='Q42307600'>Megaris</pl>, but my opinion, which is confirmed by extant evidence, is that he ruled over <pl id='Q1172948'>Daulis</pl> beyond <pl id='Q13574678'>Chaeronea</pl>, for in ancient times the greater part of what is now called Greece was inhabited by foreigners. When <prn id='Q1138506'>Tereus</prn> did what he did to <prn id='Q115449'>Philomela</prn> and <prn id='Q1675360'>Itys</prn> suffered at the hands of the women, <prn id='Q1138506'>Tereus</prn> found himself unable to seize them. </p>
<p id='1.41.9'><b>1.41.9</b> He committed suicide in <pl id='Q42307600'>Megara</pl>, and the <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarians</pl> forthwith raised him a barrow, and every year sacrifice to him, using in the sacrifice gravel instead of barley meal; they say that the bird called the hoopoe appeared here for the first time. The women came to <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, and while lamenting their sufferings and their revenge, perished through their tears; their reported metamorphosis into a nightingale and a swallow is due, I think, to the fact that the note of these birds is plaintive and like a lamentation. </p>
<p id='1.42.1'><b>1.42.1</b> The <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarians</pl> have another acropolis, which is named after <prn id='Q1417968'>Alcathous</prn>. As you ascend this acropolis you see on the right the tomb of <prn id='Q247446'>Megareus</prn>, who at the time of the <pl id='Q4752820'>Cretan</pl> invasion came as an ally from <pl id='Q3063303'>Onchestus</pl>. There is also shown a hearth of the gods called <prn id='Q107315377'>Prodomeis</prn> (Builders before). They say that <prn id='Q1417968'>Alcathous</prn> was the first to sacrifice to them, at the time when he was about to begin the building of the wall. </p>
<p id='1.42.2'><b>1.42.2</b> Near this hearth is a stone, on which they say <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> laid his lyre when he was helping <prn id='Q1417968'>Alcathous</prn> in the building. I am confirmed in my view that the <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarians</pl> used to be tributary to the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> by the fact that <prn id='Q1417968'>Alcathous</prn> appears to have sent his daughter <prn id='Q1295435'>Periboea</prn> with <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> to <pl id='Q4752820'>Crete</pl> in payment of the tribute. On the occasion of his building the wall, the <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarians</pl> say, <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> helped him and placed his lyre on the stone; and if you happen to hit it with a pebble it sounds just as a lyre does when struck. </p>
<p id='1.42.3'><b>1.42.3</b> This made me marvel, but the colossus in <pl id='Q11768'>Egypt</pl> made me marvel far more than anything else. In <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptian</pl> <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>, on crossing the <pl id='Q3392'>Nile</pl> to the so called Pipes, I saw a statue, still sitting, which gave out a sound. The many call it <prn id='Q506781'>Memnon</prn>, who they say from <pl id='Q410453'>Aethiopia</pl> overran <pl id='Q11768'>Egypt</pl> and as far as <pl id='Q180773'>Susa</pl>. The <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl>, however, say that it is a statue, not of <prn id='Q506781'>Memnon</prn>, but of a native named Phamenoph, and I have heard some say that it is <prn id='Q16879570'>Sesostris</prn>. This statue was broken in two by <prn id='Q182483'>Cambyses</prn>, and at the present day from head to middle it is thrown down; but the rest is seated, and every day at the rising of the sun it makes a noise, and the sound one could best liken to that of a harp or lyre when a string has been broken. </p>
<p id='1.42.4'><b>1.42.4</b> The <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarians</pl> have a council chamber which once, they say, was the grave of <prn id='Q247446'>Timalcus</prn>, who just now I said was not killed by <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>. On the top of the acropolis is built a temple of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, with an image gilt except the hands and feet; these and the face are of ivory. There is another sanctuary built here, of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> <prn id='Q107315404'>Nike</prn>, and yet a third of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> <prn id='Q21548177'>Aeantis</prn> (Ajaxian). About the last the <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarian</pl> guides have omitted to record anything, but I will write what I take to be the facts. <prn id='Q331327'>Telamon</prn> the son of <prn id='Q206187'>Aeacus</prn> married <prn id='Q1295435'>Periboea</prn> the daughter of <prn id='Q1417968'>Alcathous</prn>; so my opinion is that <prn id='Q172725'>Ajax</prn>, who succeeded to the throne of <prn id='Q1417968'>Alcathous</prn>, made the statue of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.42.5'><b>1.42.5</b> The ancient temple of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> was of brick, but the emperor <prn id='Q1427'>Hadrian</prn> afterwards built it of white marble. The <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> called <prn id='Q107189402'>Pythian</prn> and the one called <prn id='Q59617178'>Decatephorus</prn> (Bringer of Tithes) are very like the <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptian</pl> wooden images, but the one surnamed <prn id='Q55414242'>Archegetes</prn> (Founder) resembles <pl id='Q191082'>Aeginetan</pl> works. They are all alike made of ebony. I have heard a man of <pl id='Q644636'>Cyprus</pl>, who was skilled at sorting herbs for medicinal purposes, say that the ebony does not grow leaves or bear fruit, or even appear in the sunlight at all, but consists of underground roots which are dug up by the <pl id='Q410453'>Aethiopians</pl>, who have men skilled at finding ebony. </p>
<p id='1.42.6'><b>1.42.6</b> There is also a sanctuary of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> <prn id='Q2401559'>Thesmophorus</prn> (Lawgiver). On going down from it you see the tomb of <prn id='Q3650899'>Callipolis</prn>, son of <prn id='Q1417968'>Alcathous</prn>. <prn id='Q1417968'>Alcathous</prn> had also an elder son, <prn id='Q12752432'>Ischepolis</prn>, whom his father sent to help <prn id='Q321541'>Meleager</prn> to destroy the wild beast in <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolia</pl>. There he died, and <prn id='Q3650899'>Callipolis</prn> was the first to hear of his death. Running up to the acropolis, at the moment when his father was preparing a fire to sacrifice to <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, he flung the logs from the altar. <prn id='Q1417968'>Alcathous</prn>, who had not yet heard of the fate of <prn id='Q12752432'>Ischepolis</prn>, judged that <prn id='Q3650899'>Callipolis</prn> was guilty of impiety, and forthwith, angry as he was, killed him by striking his head with one of the logs that had been flung from the altar. </p>
<p id='1.42.7'><b>1.42.7</b> On the road to the Town-hall is the shrine of the heroine <prn id='Q223690'>Ino</prn>, about which is a fencing of stones, and beside it grow olives. The <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarians</pl> are the only Greeks who say that the corpse of <prn id='Q223690'>Ino</prn> was cast up on their coast, that <prn id='Q12879143'>Cleso</prn> and <prn id='Q107315501'>Tauropolis</prn>, the daughters of <prn id='Q2980787'>Cleson</prn>, son of <prn id='Q1657298'>Lelex</prn>, found and buried it, and they say that among them first was she named <prn id='Q223690'>Leucothea</prn>, and that every year they offer her sacrifice. </p>
<p id='1.43.1'><b>1.43.1</b> They say that there is also a shrine of the heroine <prn id='Q192673'>Iphigenia</prn>; for she too according to them died in <pl id='Q42307600'>Megara</pl>. Now I have heard another account of <prn id='Q192673'>Iphigenia</prn> that is given by <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> and I know that <prn id='Q44233'>Hesiod</prn>, in his poem <prn id='Q1233074'>Catalogue of Women</prn>, says that <prn id='Q192673'>Iphigenia</prn> did not die, but by the will of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> is <prn id='Q131575'>Hecate</prn>. With this agrees the account of <prn id='Q26825'>Herodotus</prn>, that the <pl id='Q7835'>Tauri</pl> near <pl id='Q845909'>Scythia</pl> sacrifice castaways to a maiden who they say is <prn id='Q192673'>Iphigenia</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn>. <prn id='Q223152'>Adrastus</prn> also is honored among the <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarians</pl>, who say that he too died among them when he was leading back his army after taking <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>, and that his death was caused by old age and the fate of <prn id='Q10966726'>Aegialeus</prn>. A sanctuary of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> was made by <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn> when he came to persuade <prn id='Q725527'>Calchas</prn>, who dwelt in <pl id='Q42307600'>Megara</pl>, to accompany him to <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl>. </p>

Near the Prytaneion is a rock. They name it Anaclethris (Recall), because <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> (if the story be credible) here too called her daughter back when she was wandering in search of her. Even in our day the <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarian</pl> women hold a performance that is a mimic representation of the legend. </p>
<p id='1.43.3'><b>1.43.3</b> In the city are graves of <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarians</pl>. They made one for those who died in the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl> invasion, and what is called the Aesymnium (Shrine of Aesymnus) was also a tomb of heroes. When <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn>'s son <prn id='Q61060088'>Hyperion</prn>, the last king of <pl id='Q42307600'>Megara</pl>, was killed by <prn id='Q114304828'>Sandion</prn> for his greed and violence, they resolved no longer to be ruled by one king, but to have elected magistrates and to obey one another in turn. Then <prn id='Q85965733'>Aesymnus</prn>, who had a reputation second to none among the <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarians</pl>, came to the god in <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> and asked in what way they could be prosperous. The oracle in its reply said that they would fare well if they took counsel with the majority. This utterance they took to refer to the dead, and built a council chamber in this place in order that the grave of their heroes might be within it. </p>
<p id='1.43.4'><b>1.43.4</b> Between this and the hero-shrine of <prn id='Q1417968'>Alcathous</prn>, which in my day the <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarians</pl> used as a record office, was the tomb, they said, of <prn id='Q105720836'>Pyrgo</prn>, the wife of <prn id='Q1417968'>Alcathous</prn> before he married <prn id='Q60649035'>Euaechme</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q247446'>Megareus</prn>, and the tomb of <prn id='Q107315591'>Iphinoe</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q1417968'>Alcathous</prn>; she died, they say, a maid. It is customary for the girls to bring libations to the tomb of <prn id='Q107315591'>Iphinoe</prn> and to offer a lock of their hair before their wedding, just as the daughters of the <pl id='Q173148'>Delians</pl> once cut their hair for <prn id='Q62132565'>Hecaerge</prn> and <prn id='Q2026930'>Opis</prn>. </p>

By the side of it is a <prn id='Q163709'>Satyr</prn> of <pl id='Q65040323'>Parian</pl> marble made by <prn id='Q105290'>Praxiteles</prn>. This <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> they call <prn id='Q11940519'>Patroos</prn> (Paternal); but the image of another, that they surname <prn id='Q59591527'>Dasyllius</prn>, they say was dedicated by <prn id='Q114309884'>Euchenor</prn>, son of <prn id='Q114309871'>Coeranus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q2335996'>Polyidus</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.43.6'><b>1.43.6</b> After the sanctuary of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> is a temple of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>, with an ivory image of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> surnamed Praxis (Action). This is the oldest object in the temple. There is also <prn id='Q611171'>Persuasion</prn> and another goddess, whom they name <prn id='Q114309990'>Paregoros</prn> (consoler), works of <prn id='Q105290'>Praxiteles</prn>.

<p id='1.43.7'><b>1.43.7</b> The <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarians</pl> have also the grave of <prn id='Q3693467'>Coroebus</prn>. The poetical story of him, although it equally concerns <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>, I will relate here. They say that in the reign of <prn id='Q1132777'>Crotopus</prn> at <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>, <prn id='Q129168'>Psamathe</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q1132777'>Crotopus</prn>, bore a son to <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, and being in dire terror of her father, exposed the child. He was found and destroyed by sheepdogs of <prn id='Q1132777'>Crotopus</prn>, and <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> sent <prn id='Q2992411'>Poine</prn> (Vengeance) to the city to punish the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>. They say that she used to snatch the children from their mothers, until <prn id='Q3693467'>Coroebus</prn> to please the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> slew <prn id='Q2992411'>Poine</prn>. Whereat as a second punishment plague fell upon them and stayed not. So <prn id='Q3693467'>Coroebus</prn> of his own accord went to <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> to submit to the punishment of the god for having slain <prn id='Q2992411'>Poine</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.43.8'><b>1.43.8</b> The <prn id='Q220344'>Pythia</prn> would not allow <prn id='Q3693467'>Coroebus</prn> to return to <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>, but ordered him to take up a tripod and carry it out of the sanctuary, and where the tripod should fall from his hands, there he was to build a temple of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> and to dwell himself. At Mount <pl id='Q749507'>Gerania</pl> the tripod slipped and fell unawares. Here he dwelt in the village called <pl id='Q15961462'>Tripodiskoi</pl>. The grave of <prn id='Q3693467'>Coroebus</prn> is in the agora of the <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarians</pl>. The story of <prn id='Q129168'>Psamathe</prn> and of <prn id='Q3693467'>Coroebus</prn> himself is carved on it in elegiac verses and further, upon the top of the grave is represented <prn id='Q3693467'>Coroebus</prn> slaying <prn id='Q2992411'>Poine</prn>. These are the oldest stone images I am aware of having seen among the Greeks. </p>
<p id='1.44.1'><b>1.44.1</b> Near <prn id='Q3693467'>Coroebus</prn> is buried <prn id='Q796763'>Orsippus</prn> who won the footrace at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> by running naked when all his competitors wore girdles according to ancient custom. They say also that <prn id='Q796763'>Orsippus</prn> when general afterwards annexed some of the neighboring territory. My own opinion is that at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> he intentionally let the girdle slip off him, realizing that a naked man can run more easily than one girt. </p>
<p id='1.44.2'><b>1.44.2</b> As you go down from the agora you see on the right of the street called Straight a sanctuary of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> <prn id='Q107315843'>Prostaterius</prn> (Protecting). You must turn a little aside from the road to discover it. In it is a noteworthy <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> also, and <prn id='Q103107'>Leto</prn>, and other statues, made by <prn id='Q105290'>Praxiteles</prn>. In the old gymnasium near the gate called the Gate of the <prn id='Q373916'>Nymphs</prn> is a stone of the shape of a small pyramid. This they name <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> <prn id='Q107315859'>Carinus</prn>, and here there is a sanctuary of the <prn id='Q94066'>Eileithyiae</prn>. Such are the sights that the city had to show. </p>
<p id='1.44.3'><b>1.44.3</b> When you have gone down to the port, which to the present day is called <pl id='Q2537089'>Nisaea</pl>, you see a sanctuary of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> <prn id='Q114310129'>Malophorus</prn> (<prn id='Q7368'>Sheep</prn>-bearer or Apple-bearer). One of the accounts given of the surname is that those who first reared <prn id='Q7368'>sheep</prn> in the land named <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> <prn id='Q114310129'>Malophorus</prn>. The roof of the temple one might conclude has fallen in through age. There is an acropolis here, which also is called <pl id='Q2537089'>Nisaea</pl>. Below the acropolis near the sea is the tomb of <prn id='Q1657298'>Lelex</prn>, who they say arrived from <pl id='Q11768'>Egypt</pl> and became king, being the son of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> and of <prn id='Q1129914'>Libya</prn>, daughter of <prn id='Q675699'>Epaphus</prn>. Parallel to <pl id='Q2537089'>Nisaea</pl> lies the small island of <pl id='Q56397302'>Minoa</pl>, where in the war against <prn id='Q1136201'>Nisus</prn> anchored the fleet of the <pl id='Q4752820'>Cretans</pl>. </p>
<p id='1.44.4'><b>1.44.4</b> The hilly part of <pl id='Q42307600'>Megaris</pl> borders upon <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl>, and in it the <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarians</pl> have built the city <pl id='Q935675'>Pagae</pl> and another one called <pl id='Q2827860'>Aegosthena</pl>. As you go to <pl id='Q935675'>Pagae</pl>, on turning a little aside from the highway, you are shown a rock with arrows stuck all over it, into which the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl> once shot in the night. In <pl id='Q935675'>Pagae</pl> a noteworthy relic is a bronze image of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> surnamed <prn id='Q2303797'>Saviour</prn>, in size equal to that at <pl id='Q42307600'>Megara</pl> and exactly like it in shape. There is also a hero-shrine of <prn id='Q10966726'>Aegialeus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q223152'>Adrastus</prn>. When the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> made their second attack on <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> he died at <pl id='Q11924352'>Glisas</pl> early in the first battle, and his relatives carried him to <pl id='Q935675'>Pagae</pl> in <pl id='Q42307600'>Megaris</pl> and buried him, the shrine being still called the Aegialeum. </p>
<p id='1.44.5'><b>1.44.5</b> In <pl id='Q2827860'>Aegosthena</pl> is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q602258'>Melampus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q482134'>Amythaon</prn>, and a small figure of a man carved upon a slab. To <prn id='Q602258'>Melampus</prn> they sacrifice and hold a festival every year. They say that he divines neither by dreams nor in any other way. Here is something else that I heard in Erenea, a village of the <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarians</pl>. <prn id='Q94072'>Autonoe</prn>, daughter of <prn id='Q27613'>Cadmus</prn>, left <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> to live here owing to her great grief at the death of <prn id='Q208531'>Actaeon</prn>, the manner of which is told in legend, and at the general misfortune of her father's house. The tomb of <prn id='Q94072'>Autonoe</prn> is in this village. </p>
<p id='1.44.6'><b>1.44.6</b> On the road from <pl id='Q42307600'>Megara</pl> to <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl> are graves, including that of the <pl id='Q13580795'>Samian</pl> flute-player <prn id='Q4454129'>Telephanes</prn>, said to have been made by <prn id='Q230258'>Cleopatra</prn>, daughter of <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn>, son of <prn id='Q313907'>Amyntas</prn>. There is also the <pl id='Q56397568'>tomb</pl> of <prn id='Q1728858'>Car</prn>, son of <prn id='Q649624'>Phoroneus</prn>, which was originally a mound of earth, but afterwards, at the command of the oracle, it was adorned with mussel stone. The <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarians</pl> are the only Greeks to possess this stone, and in the city also they have made many things out of it. It is very white, and softer than other stone; in it throughout are sea mussels. Such is the nature of the stone. The road called <pl id='Q60791648'>Scironian</pl> to this day and named after <prn id='Q1469237'>Sciron</prn>, was made by him when he was war minister of the <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarians</pl>, and originally they say was constructed for the use of active men. But the emperor <prn id='Q1427'>Hadrian</prn> broadened it, and made it suitable even for chariots to pass each other in opposite directions. </p>
<p id='1.44.7'><b>1.44.7</b> There are legends about the rocks, which rise especially at the narrow part of the road. As to the Molurian, it is said that from it <prn id='Q223690'>Ino</prn> flung herself into the sea with <prn id='Q738007'>Melicertes</prn>, the younger of her children. <prn id='Q1462644'>Learchus</prn>, the elder of them, had been killed by his father. One account is that <prn id='Q143880'>Athamas</prn> did this in a fit of madness; another is that he vented on <prn id='Q223690'>Ino</prn> and her children unbridled rage when he learned that the famine which befell the <pl id='Q543895'>Orchomenians</pl> and the supposed death of <prn id='Q743482'>Phrixus</prn> were not accidents from heaven, but that <prn id='Q223690'>Ino</prn>, the step-mother, had intrigued for all these things. </p>
<p id='1.44.8'><b>1.44.8</b> Then it was that she fled to the sea and cast herself and her son from the Molurian Rock. The son, they say, was landed on the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthian</pl> <pl id='Q215200'>Isthmus</pl> by a <prn id='Q7369'>dolphin</prn>, and honors were offered to <prn id='Q738007'>Melicertes</prn>, then renamed <prn id='Q738007'>Palaemon</prn>, including the celebration of the <prn id='Q675181'>Isthmian games</prn>. The <pl id='Q60791648'>Molurian rock</pl> they thought sacred to <prn id='Q223690'>Leucothea</prn> and <prn id='Q738007'>Palaemon</prn>; but those after it they consider accursed, in that <prn id='Q1469237'>Sciron</prn>, who dwelt by them, used to cast into the sea all the strangers he met. A tortoise used to swim under the rocks to seize those that fell in. Sea tortoises are like land tortoises except in size and for their feet, which are like those of <prn id='Q208549'>seals</prn>. Retribution for these deeds overtook <prn id='Q1469237'>Sciron</prn>, for he was cast into the same sea by <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>. </p>
<p id='1.44.9'><b>1.44.9</b> On the top of the mountain is a temple of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> surnamed <prn id='Q55322627'>Aphesius</prn> (Releaser).

<p id='2.1.2'><b>2.1.2</b> <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl> is no longer inhabited by any of the old <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthians</pl>, but by colonists sent out by the Romans. This change is due to the <prn id='Q244796'>Achaean League</prn>. The <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthians</pl>, being members of it, joined in the war against the Romans, which <prn id='Q1073837'>Critolaus</prn>, when appointed general of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, brought about by persuading to revolt both the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> and the majority of the Greeks outside the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl>. When the Romans won the war, they carried out a general disarmament of the Greeks and dismantled the walls of such cities as were fortified. <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl> was laid waste by <prn id='Q445455'>Mummius</prn>, who at that time commanded the Romans in the field, and it is said that it was afterwards refounded by <prn id='Q1048'>Caesar</prn>, who was the author of the present constitution of <pl id='Q18287233'>Rome</pl>. <pl id='Q6343'>Carthage</pl>, too, they say, was refounded in his reign. </p>
<p id='2.1.3'><b>2.1.3</b> In the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthian</pl> territory is also the place called <pl id='Q1789784'>Cromyon</pl> from <prn id='Q58918959'>Cromus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>. Here they say that <prn id='Q1751992'>Phaea</prn> was bred; overcoming this <prn id='Q1751992'>sow</prn> was one of the traditional achievements of <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>. Farther on the pine still grew by the shore at the time of my visit, and there was an altar of <prn id='Q738007'>Melicertes</prn>. At this place, they say, the boy was brought ashore by a <prn id='Q7369'>dolphin</prn>; <prn id='Q102561'>Sisyphus</prn> found him lying and gave him burial on the <pl id='Q16600469'>Isthmus</pl>, establishing the <prn id='Q675181'>Isthmian games</prn> in his honor. </p>
<p id='2.1.4'><b>2.1.4</b> At the beginning of the <pl id='Q215200'>Isthmus</pl> is the place where the brigand <prn id='Q843335'>Sinis</prn> used to take hold of pine trees and draw them down. All those whom he overcame in fight he used to tie to the trees, and then allow them to swing up again. Thereupon each of the pines used to drag to itself the bound man, and as the bond gave way in neither direction but was stretched equally in both, he was torn in two. This was the way in which <prn id='Q843335'>Sinis</prn> himself was slain by <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>. For <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> rid of evildoers the road from <pl id='Q581494'>Troezen</pl> to <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, killing those whom I have enumerated and, in sacred <pl id='Q233576'>Epidaurus</pl>, <prn id='Q28126889'>Periphetes</prn>, thought to be the son of <prn id='Q44384'>Hephaestus</prn>, who used to fight with a bronze club. </p>
<p id='2.1.5'><b>2.1.5</b> The <pl id='Q215200'>Corinthian Isthmus</pl> stretches on the one hand to the sea at <pl id='Q111565756'>Cenchreae</pl>, and on the other to the sea at <pl id='Q1811299'>Lechaeum</pl>. For this is what makes the region to the south mainland. He who tried to make the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl> an island gave up before digging through the <pl id='Q215200'>Isthmus</pl>. Where they began to dig is still to be seen, but into the rock they did not advance at all. So it still is mainland as its nature is to be. <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn> the son of <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn> wished to dig through <pl id='Q31529408'>Mimas</pl>, and his attempt to do this was his only unsuccessful project. The <pl id='Q690575'>Cnidians</pl> began to dig through their isthmus, but the <prn id='Q220344'>Pythian priestess</prn> stopped them. So difficult it is for man to alter by violence what Heaven has made. </p>
<p id='2.1.6'><b>2.1.6</b> A legend of the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthians</pl> about their land is not peculiar to them, for I believe that the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> were the first to relate a similar story to glorify <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl>. The <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthians</pl> say that <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> had a dispute with <prn id='Q134270'>Helius</prn> (Sun) about the land, and that <prn id='Q849647'>Briareos</prn> arbitrated between them, assigning to <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> the <pl id='Q16600469'>Isthmus</pl> and the parts adjoining, and giving to <prn id='Q134270'>Helius</prn> the <pl id='Q420810'>height above the city</pl>. Ever since, they say, the <pl id='Q215200'>Isthmus</pl> has belonged to <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.1.7'><b>2.1.7</b> Worth seeing here are a <pl id='Q38283549'>theater</pl> and a white-marble race-course. Within the sanctuary of the god stand on the one side portrait statues of athletes who have won victories at the <prn id='Q675181'>Isthmian games</prn>, on the other side pine trees growing in a row, the greater number of them rising up straight. On the <pl id='Q18385210'>temple</pl>, which is not very large, stand bronze <prn id='Q1860727'>Tritons</prn>. In the fore-temple are images, two of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, a third of <prn id='Q180222'>Amphitrite</prn>, and a <prn id='Q659437'>Thalassa</prn> (Sea), which also is of bronze. The offerings inside were dedicated in our time by <prn id='Q311879'>Herodes</prn> the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl>, four <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn>, gilded except for the hoofs, which are of ivory, </p>
<p id='2.1.8'><b>2.1.8</b> and two gold <prn id='Q1860727'>Tritons</prn> beside the <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn>, with the parts below the waist of ivory. On the car stand <prn id='Q180222'>Amphitrite</prn> and <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, and there is the boy <prn id='Q738007'>Palaemon</prn> upright upon a <prn id='Q7369'>dolphin</prn>. These too are made of ivory and gold. On the middle of the base on which the car is has been wrought a Sea holding up the young <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>, and on either side are the nymphs called <prn id='Q54230'>Nereids</prn>. I know that there are altars to these in other parts of Greece, and that some Greeks have even dedicated to them precincts by shores, where honors are also paid to <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn>. In <pl id='Q175923'>Gabala</pl> is a holy sanctuary of <prn id='Q12876506'>Doto</prn>, where there was still remaining the robe by which the Greeks say that <prn id='Q1125040'>Eriphyle</prn> was bribed to wrong her son <prn id='Q591089'>Alcmaeon</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.1.9'><b>2.1.9</b> Among the reliefs on the base of the statue of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> are the sons of <prn id='Q192946'>Tyndareus</prn>, because these too are saviours of ships and of sea-faring men. The other offerings are images of <prn id='Q1491820'>Galene</prn> (Calm) and of <prn id='Q659437'>Thalassa</prn> (Sea), a <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn> like a whale from the breast onward, <prn id='Q223690'>Ino</prn> and <prn id='Q189872'>Bellerophontes</prn>, and the <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn> <prn id='Q162797'>Pegasus</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.2.1'><b>2.2.1</b> Within the enclosure is on the left a temple of <prn id='Q738007'>Palaemon</prn>, with images in it of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, <prn id='Q223690'>Leucothea</prn> and <prn id='Q738007'>Palaemon</prn> himself. There is also what is called his Holy of Holies, and an underground descent to it, where they say that <prn id='Q738007'>Palaemon</prn> is concealed. Whosoever, whether <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthian</pl> or stranger, swears falsely here, can by no means escape from his oath. There is also an ancient sanctuary called the altar of the <prn id='Q128430'>Cyclopes</prn>, and they sacrifice to the <prn id='Q128430'>Cyclopes</prn> upon it. </p>
<p id='2.2.2'><b>2.2.2</b> The graves of <prn id='Q102561'>Sisyphus</prn> and of <prn id='Q637955'>Neleus</prn> — for they say that <prn id='Q637955'>Neleus</prn> came to <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl>, died of disease, and was buried near the <pl id='Q16600469'>Isthmus</pl> — I do not think that anyone would look for after reading <prn id='Q391254'>Eumelus</prn>. For he says that not even to <prn id='Q193267'>Nestor</prn> did <prn id='Q102561'>Sisyphus</prn> show the tomb of <prn id='Q637955'>Neleus</prn>, because it must be kept unknown to everybody alike, and that <prn id='Q102561'>Sisyphus</prn> is indeed buried on the <pl id='Q215200'>Isthmus</pl>, but that few <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthians</pl>, even those of his own day, knew where the grave was. The <prn id='Q675181'>Isthmian games</prn> were not interrupted even when <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl> had been laid waste by <prn id='Q445455'>Mummius</prn>, but so long as it lay deserted the celebration of the games was entrusted to the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl>, and when it was rebuilt the honor was restored to the present inhabitants. </p>
<p id='2.2.3'><b>2.2.3</b> The names of the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthian</pl> harbors were given them by <prn id='Q107392242'>Leches</prn> and <prn id='Q57208772'>Cenchrias</prn>, said to be the children of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> and <prn id='Q4843985'>Peirene</prn> the daughter of <pl id='Q203923'>Achelous</pl>, though in the poem called <prn id='Q1233074'>The Great Eoeae</prn> <prn id='Q4843985'>Peirene</prn> is said to be a daughter of <prn id='Q1162217'>Oebalus</prn>. In <pl id='Q1811299'>Lechaeum</pl> are a sanctuary and a bronze image of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, and on the road leading from the <pl id='Q16600469'>Isthmus</pl> to <pl id='Q111565756'>Cenchreae</pl> a temple and ancient wooden image of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>. In <pl id='Q111565756'>Cenchreae</pl> are a temple and a stone statue of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>, after it on the mole running into the sea a bronze image of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, and at the other end of the harbor sanctuaries of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> and of <prn id='Q79876'>Isis</prn>. Right opposite <pl id='Q111565756'>Cenchreae</pl> is <place id='379230XLou'>Helen's Bath</place>. It is a large stream of salt, tepid water, flowing from a rock into the sea. </p>
<p id='2.2.4'><b>2.2.4</b> As one goes up to <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl> are tombs, and by the gate is buried <prn id='Q59180'>Diogenes</prn> of <pl id='Q107557833'>Sinope</pl>, whom the Greeks surname the <prn id='Q144'>Dog</prn>. Before the city is a grove of cypresses called Craneum. Here are a precinct of <prn id='Q189872'>Bellerophontes</prn>, a temple of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> <prn id='Q107247911'>Melaenis</prn> and the grave of <prn id='Q441736'>Lais</prn>, upon which is set a lioness holding a ram in her fore-paws. </p>
<p id='2.2.5'><b>2.2.5</b> There is in <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessaly</pl> another tomb which claims to be that of <prn id='Q441736'>Lais</prn>, for she went to that country also when she fell in love with Hippostrat1. The story is that originally she was of <pl id='Q728102'>Hycara</pl> in <pl id='Q4951156'>Sicily</pl>. Taken captive while yet a girl by <prn id='Q315822'>Nicias</prn> and the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, she was sold and brought to <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl>, where she surpassed in beauty the courtesans of her time, and so won the admiration of the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthians</pl> that even now they claim <prn id='Q441736'>Lais</prn> as their own. </p>
<p id='2.2.6'><b>2.2.6</b> The things worthy of mention in the city include the extant remains of antiquity, but the greater number of them belong to the period of its second ascendancy. On the agora, where most of the sanctuaries are, stand <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> surnamed <pl id='Q47611'>Ephesian</pl> and wooden images of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>, which are covered with gold with the exception of their faces; these are ornamented with red paint. They are called <prn id='Q107247818'>Lysius</prn> and <prn id='Q107349772'>Baccheus</prn>, </p>
<p id='2.2.7'><b>2.2.7</b> and I too give the story told about them. They say that <prn id='Q391091'>Pentheus</prn> treated <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> despitefully, his crowning outrage being that he went to <pl id='Q1147780'>Cithaeron</pl>, to spy upon the women, and climbing up a tree beheld what was done. When the women detected <prn id='Q391091'>Pentheus</prn>, they immediately dragged him down, and joined in tearing him, living as he was, limb from limb. Afterwards, as the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthians</pl> say, the <prn id='Q220344'>Pythian priestess</prn> commanded them by an oracle to discover that tree and to worship it equally with the god. For this reason they have made these images from the tree. </p>
<p id='2.2.8'><b>2.2.8</b> There is also a temple of <prn id='Q213440'>Fortune</prn>, with a standing image of <pl id='Q65040323'>Parian</pl> marble. Beside it is a sanctuary for all the gods. Hard by is built a fountain, on which is a bronze <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>; under the feet of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> is a <prn id='Q7369'>dolphin</prn> spouting water. There is also a bronze <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> surnamed <pl id='Q1933754'>Clarius</pl> and a statue of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> made by <prn id='Q1336424'>Hermogenes</prn> of <pl id='Q11855334'>Cythera</pl>. There are two bronze, standing images of <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn>, for one of which a temple has been made. The images of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> also are in the open; one had not a surname, another they call <prn id='Q57446061'>Chthonius</prn> (of the Lower World) and the third Most High. </p>
<p id='2.3.1'><b>2.3.1</b> In the middle of the agora is a bronze <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, on the pedestal of which are wrought in relief figures of the <prn id='Q66016'>Muses</prn>. Above the agora is a <pl id='Q25451391'>temple</pl> of <prn id='Q229483'>Octavia</prn> the sister of <prn id='Q1405'>Augustus</prn>, who was emperor of the Romans after <prn id='Q1048'>Caesar</prn>, the founder of the modern <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl>. </p>
<p id='2.3.2'><b>2.3.2</b> On leaving the agora along the road to <pl id='Q1811299'>Lechaeum</pl> you come to a gateway, on which are two gilded chariots, one carrying <prn id='Q203480'>Phaethon</prn> the son of <prn id='Q134270'>Helius</prn> (Sun), the other <prn id='Q134270'>Helius</prn> himself. A little farther away from the gateway, on the right as you go in, is a bronze <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>. After this is the entrance to the water of <pl id='Q3389191'>Peirene</pl>. The legend about <prn id='Q4843985'>Peirene</prn> is that she was a woman who became a spring because of her tears shed in lamentation for her son <prn id='Q4843985'>Cenchrias</prn>, who was unintentionally killed by <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.3.3'><b>2.3.3</b> The <pl id='Q3389191'>spring</pl> is ornamented with white marble, and there have been made chambers like caves, out of which the water flows into an open-air well. It Is pleasant to drink, and they say that the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthian</pl> bronze, when red-hot, is tempered by this water, since bronze . . . the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthians</pl> have not. Moreover near <pl id='Q3389191'>Peirene</pl> are an image and a sacred enclosure of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>; in the latter is a painting of the exploit of <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn> against the suitors. </p>
<p id='2.3.4'><b>2.3.4</b> Proceeding on the direct road to <pl id='Q1811299'>Lechaeum</pl> we see a bronze image of a seated <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn>. By him stands a ram, for <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> is the god who is thought most to care for and to increase flocks, as <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> puts it in the <prn id='Q8275'>Iliad</prn>: “Son was he of <prn id='Q3747915'>Phorbas</prn>, the dearest of <pl id='Q22647'>Trojans</pl> to <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn>, Rich in flocks, for the god vouchsafed him wealth in abundance.” The story told at the mysteries of the <prn id='Q334486'>Mother</prn> about <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> and the ram I know but do not relate. After the image of <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> come <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, <prn id='Q223690'>Leucothea</prn>, and <prn id='Q738007'>Palaemon</prn> on a <prn id='Q7369'>dolphin</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.3.5'><b>2.3.5</b> The <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthians</pl> have baths in many parts of the city, some put up at the public charge and one by the emperor <prn id='Q1427'>Hadrian</prn>. The most famous bath is near the <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>. It was made by the <pl id='Q5690'>Spartan</pl> <prn id='Q19720500'>Eurycles</prn>, who beautified it with various kinds of stone, especially the <prn id='Q1789729'>one quarried</prn> at <pl id='Q48781592'>Croceae</pl> in <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconia</pl>. On the left of the entrance stands a <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, and after him <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> hunting. Throughout the city are many wells, for the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthians</pl> have a copious supply of flowing water, besides the <pl id='Q56295608'>water</pl> which the emperor <prn id='Q1427'>Hadrian</prn> brought from Lake <pl id='Q2359730'>Stymphalus</pl>, but the most noteworthy is the one by the side of the image of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>. Over it is a <prn id='Q189872'>Bellerophontes</prn>, and the water flows through the hoof of the <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn> <prn id='Q162797'>Pegasus</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.3.6'><b>2.3.6</b> As you go along another road from the agora, which leads to <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl>, you can see on the right of the road a temple and bronze image of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, and a little farther on a well called the <pl id='Q22681295'>Well</pl> of <prn id='Q269058'>Glauce</prn>. Into this they say she threw herself in the belief that the water would be a cure for the drugs of <prn id='Q174278'>Medea</prn>. Above this well has been built what is called the <pl id='Q25461265'>Odeion</pl> (music hall), beside which is the tomb of <prn id='Q174278'>Medea</prn>'s children. Their names were <prn id='Q13635441'>Mermerus</prn> and <prn id='Q731181'>Pheres</prn>, and they are said to have been stoned to death by the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthians</pl> owing to the gifts which legend says they brought to <prn id='Q269058'>Glauce</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.3.7'><b>2.3.7</b> But as their death was violent and illegal, the young babies of the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthians</pl> were destroyed by them until, at the command of the oracle, yearly sacrifices were established in their honor and a figure of <prn id='Q115822787'>Deima</prn> (terror) was set up. This figure still exists, being the likeness of a woman frightful to look upon but after <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl> was laid waste by the Romans and the old <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthians</pl> were wiped out, the new settlers broke the custom of offering those sacrifices to the sons of <prn id='Q174278'>Medea</prn>, nor do their children cut their hair for them or wear black clothes. </p>
<p id='2.3.8'><b>2.3.8</b> On the occasion referred to <prn id='Q174278'>Medea</prn> went to <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> and married <prn id='Q191725'>Aegeus</prn>, but subsequently she was detected plotting against <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> and fled from <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> also; coming to the land then called <pl id='Q654243'>Aria</pl> she caused its inhabitants to be named after her <pl id='Q3853673'>Medes</pl>. The son, whom she brought with her in her flight to the Arii, they say she had by <prn id='Q191725'>Aegeus</prn>, and that his name was <prn id='Q1851846'>Medus</prn>. <prn id='Q504744'>Hellanicus</prn>, however, calls him Polyxenus and says that his father was <prn id='Q176758'>Jason</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.3.9'><b>2.3.9</b> The Greeks have an epic poem called <prn id='Q3337166'>Naupactia</prn>.

But <prn id='Q726952'>Cinaethon</prn> of <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl>, another writer of pedigrees in verse, said that <prn id='Q176758'>Jason</prn>'s children by <prn id='Q174278'>Medea</prn> were a son <prn id='Q1851846'>Medeus</prn> and a daughter <prn id='Q60589121'>Eriopis</prn>; he too, however, gives no further information about these children. </p>
<p id='2.3.10'><b>2.3.10</b> <prn id='Q391254'>Eumelus</prn> said that <prn id='Q134270'>Helius</prn> (Sun) gave the Asopian land to <prn id='Q1381908'>Aloeus</prn> and Ephyraea to <prn id='Q241971'>Aeetes</prn>. When <prn id='Q241971'>Aeetes</prn> was departing for <pl id='Q183150'>Colchis</pl> he entrusted his land to <prn id='Q838393'>Bunus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> and <prn id='Q12271661'>Alcidamea</prn>, and when <prn id='Q838393'>Bunus</prn> died <prn id='Q1347568'>Epopeus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q1381908'>Aloeus</prn> extended his kingdom to include the Ephyraeans. Afterwards, when <prn id='Q31256'>Corinthus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q1638952'>Marathon</prn>, died childless, the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthians</pl> sent for <prn id='Q174278'>Medea</prn> from <pl id='Q662613'>Iolcus</pl> and bestowed upon her the kingdom. </p>

<p id='2.4.2'><b>2.4.2</b> That <prn id='Q189872'>Bellerophontes</prn> was not an absolute king, but was subject to <prn id='Q644604'>Proetus</prn> and the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> is the belief of myself and of all who have read carefully the Homeric poems. When <prn id='Q189872'>Bellerophontes</prn> migrated to <pl id='Q18927'>Lycia</pl> it is clear that the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthians</pl> none the less were subject to the despots at <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> or <pl id='Q132564'>Mycenae</pl>.

So <prn id='Q1245012'>Doridas</prn> and <prn id='Q1337269'>Hyanthidas</prn> gave up the kingship to <prn id='Q603937'>Aletes</prn> and remained at <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl>, but the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthian</pl> people were conquered in battle and expelled by the <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn>. </p>

<p id='2.4.5'><b>2.4.5</b> Now the sanctuary of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> <prn id='Q107349786'>Chalinitis</prn> is by their <pl id='Q25451392'>theater</pl>, and near is a naked wooden image of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, said to be a work of <prn id='Q134756'>Daedalus</prn>. All the works of this artist, although rather uncouth to look at, are nevertheless distinguished by something divine (ἔνθεον). Above the <pl id='Q25451392'>theater</pl> is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> surnamed in the Latin tongue <prn id='Q56641335'>Capitolinus</prn>, which might be rendered into Greek “Coryphaeos”. Not far from this theater is the ancient <pl id='Q109428923'>gymnasium</pl>, and a spring called <pl id='Q25461264'>Lerna</pl>. Pillars stand around it, and seats have been made to refresh in summer time those who have entered it. By this <pl id='Q109428923'>gymnasium</pl> are temples of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> and <pl id='Q25461264'>Asclepius</pl>. The images of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> and of <prn id='Q202257'>Health</prn> are of white marble, that of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> is of bronze. </p>
<p id='2.4.6'><b>2.4.6</b> The <pl id='Q420810'>Acrocorinthus</pl> is a mountain peak above the city, assigned to <prn id='Q134270'>Helius</prn> by <prn id='Q849647'>Briareos</prn> when he acted as adjudicator, and handed over, the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthians</pl> say, by <prn id='Q134270'>Helius</prn> to <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>. As you go up this <pl id='Q420810'>Acrocorinthus</pl> you see two precincts of <prn id='Q79876'>Isis</prn>, one οf <prn id='Q79876'>Isis</prn> surnamed <prn id='Q107349788'>Pelagian</prn> (Marine) and the other of <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptian</pl> <prn id='Q79876'>Isis</prn>, and two of <prn id='Q214554'>Serapis</prn>, one of them being of <prn id='Q214554'>Serapis</prn> called “in <pl id='Q1145180'>Canopus</pl>.” After these are altars to <prn id='Q134270'>Helius</prn>, and a sanctuary of <prn id='Q332246'>Ananke</prn> (Necessity) and <prn id='Q237224'>Bia</prn> (Violence), into which it is not customary to enter. </p>
<p id='2.4.7'><b>2.4.7</b> Above it are a temple of the <prn id='Q334486'>Mother of the gods</prn> with a stele and a throne; the stele and the throne are made of stone. The temple of the <prn id='Q180287'>Fates</prn> and <pl id='Q60790987'>that</pl> of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> and <prn id='Q45967'>Kore</prn> have images that are not exposed to view. Here, too, is the temple of <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> <prn id='Q56224244'>Bounaia</prn> set up by <prn id='Q838393'>Bounos</prn> the son of <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn>. It is for this reason that the goddess is called Bounaia. </p>
<p id='2.5.1'><b>2.5.1</b> On the summit of the <pl id='Q420810'>Acrocorinthus</pl> is a <pl id='Q57559776'>temple</pl> of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>. The images are <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> armed, <prn id='Q134270'>Helius</prn>, and <prn id='Q121973'>Eros</prn> with a bow. The spring, which is behind the temple, they say was the gift of <prn id='Q622781'>Asopus</prn> to <prn id='Q102561'>Sisyphus</prn>. The latter knew, so runs the legend, that <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> had ravished <prn id='Q321298'>Aegina</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q622781'>Asopus</prn>, but refused to give information to the seeker before he had a spring given him on the <pl id='Q420810'>Acrocorinthus</pl>. When <prn id='Q622781'>Asopus</prn> granted this request <prn id='Q102561'>Sisyphus</prn> turned informer, and on this account he receives — if anyone believes the story — punishment in <pl id='Q1521549'>Hades</pl>. I have heard people say that this spring and <pl id='Q3389191'>Peirene</pl> are the same, the water in the city flowing hence underground. </p>
<p id='2.5.2'><b>2.5.2</b> This <pl id='Q2866756'>Asopus</pl> rises in the <pl id='Q1412043'>Phliasian</pl> territory, flows through the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonian</pl>, and empties itself into the sea here. His daughters, say the <pl id='Q1412043'>Phliasians</pl>, were <prn id='Q644692'>Corcyra</prn>, <prn id='Q321298'>Aegina</prn>, and <prn id='Q2416381'>Thebe</prn>. <prn id='Q644692'>Corcyra</prn> and <prn id='Q321298'>Aegina</prn> gave new names to the islands called <pl id='Q3693378'>Scheria</pl> and <pl id='Q191082'>Oenone</pl>, while from <prn id='Q2416381'>Thebe</prn> is named the city below the <pl id='Q11225429'>Cadmea</pl>. The <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> do not agree, but say that <prn id='Q2416381'>Thebe</prn> was the daughter of the <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotian</pl>, and not of the <pl id='Q1412043'>Phliasian</pl>, <pl id='Q2866756'>Asopus</pl>. </p>
<p id='2.5.3'><b>2.5.3</b> The other stories about the river are current among both the <pl id='Q1412043'>Phliasians</pl> and the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl>, for instance that its water is foreign and not native, in that the <pl id='Q211089'>Maeander</pl>, descending from <pl id='Q617518'>Celaenae</pl> through <pl id='Q32579'>Phrygia</pl> and <pl id='Q193214'>Caria</pl>, and emptying itself into the sea at <pl id='Q169460'>Miletus</pl>, goes to the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl> and forms the <pl id='Q2866756'>Asopus</pl>. I remember hearing a similar story from the <pl id='Q173148'>Delians</pl>, that the stream which they call <pl id='Q108363834'>Inopus</pl> comes to them from the <pl id='Q3392'>Nile</pl>. Further, there is a story that the <pl id='Q3392'>Nile</pl> itself is the <pl id='Q34589'>Euphrates</pl>, which disappears into a marsh, rises again beyond <pl id='Q410453'>Aethiopia</pl> and becomes the <pl id='Q3392'>Nile</pl>. </p>
<p id='2.5.4'><b>2.5.4</b> Such is the account I heard of the <pl id='Q2866756'>Asopus</pl>. When you have turned from the <pl id='Q420810'>Acrocorinthus</pl> into the mountain road you see the Teneatic gate and a sanctuary of <prn id='Q94066'>Eilethyia</prn>. The town called <pl id='Q25535198'>Tenea</pl> is just about sixty stades distant. The inhabitants say that they are <pl id='Q22647'>Trojans</pl> who were taken prisoners in <pl id='Q211817'>Tenedos</pl> by the Greeks, and were permitted by <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn> to dwell in their present home. For this reason they honor <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> more than any other god. </p>
<p id='2.5.5'><b>2.5.5</b> As you go from <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl>, not into the interior but along the road to <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl>, there is on the left not far from the city a burnt temple. There have, of course, been many wars carried on in <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthian</pl> territory, and naturally houses and sanctuaries outside the wall have been fired. But this temple, they say, was <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>'s, and <prn id='Q322639'>Pyrrhus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn> burned it down. Subsequently I heard another account, that the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthians</pl> built the temple for <prn id='Q106460486'>Olympian</prn> <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, and that suddenly fire from some quarter fell on it and destroyed it. </p>
<p id='2.5.6'><b>2.5.6</b> The <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl>, the neighbours of the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthians</pl> at this part of the border, say about their own land that <prn id='Q1422648'>Aegialeus</prn> was its first and aboriginal inhabitant, that the district of the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl> still called <pl id='Q2790451'>Aegialus</pl> was named after him because he reigned over it, and that he founded the city <prn id='Q23504981'>Aegialea</prn> on the plain. Their acropolis, they say, was where is now their sanctuary of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>; further, that <prn id='Q1422648'>Aegialeus</prn> begat <prn id='Q654037'>Europs</prn>, <prn id='Q654037'>Europs</prn> <prn id='Q1601964'>Telchis</prn>, and Telchis <prn id='Q38366'>Apis</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.5.7'><b>2.5.7</b> This <prn id='Q38366'>Apis</prn> reached such a height of power before <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn> came to <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> that all the territory south of the <pl id='Q215200'>Isthmus</pl> was called after him ApiaYY. <prn id='Q38366'>Apis</prn> begat <prn id='Q265211'>Thelxion</prn>, <prn id='Q265211'>Thelxion</prn> <prn id='Q31541'>Aegyrus</prn>, he <prn id='Q31537'>Thurimachus</prn>, and <prn id='Q31537'>Thurimachus</prn> <prn id='Q38356'>Leucippus</prn>. <prn id='Q38356'>Leucippus</prn> had no male issue, only a daughter <prn id='Q5741517'>Calchinia</prn>. There is a story that this <prn id='Q5741517'>Calchinia</prn> mated with <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>; her child was reared by <prn id='Q38356'>Leucippus</prn>, who at his death handed over to him the kingdom.

<p id='2.5.8'><b>2.5.8</b> What is reported of <prn id='Q44060'>Plemnaeus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q41127'>Peratus</prn>, seemed to me very wonderful. All the children borne to him by his wife died the very first time they wailed. At last <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> took pity on <prn id='Q44060'>Plemnaeus</prn>, came to <prn id='Q23504981'>Aegialea</prn> in the guise of a strange woman, and reared for <prn id='Q44060'>Plemnaeus</prn> his son <prn id='Q1554419'>Orthopolis</prn>. <prn id='Q1554419'>Orthopolis</prn> had a daughter <prn id='Q57438557'>Chrysorthe</prn>, who is thought to have borne a son named <prn id='Q1582249'>Coronus</prn> to <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>. <prn id='Q1582249'>Coronus</prn> had two sons, <prn id='Q1784227'>Corax</prn> and a younger one <prn id='Q1801511'>Lamedon</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.6.1'><b>2.6.1</b> <prn id='Q1784227'>Corax</prn> died without issue, and at about this time came <prn id='Q1347568'>Epopeus</prn> from <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessaly</pl> and took the kingdom. In his reign the first hostile army is said to have invaded the land, which before this had enjoyed unbroken peace. The reason was this. <prn id='Q461439'>Antiope</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q741155'>Nycteus</prn>, had a name among the Greeks for beauty, and there was also a report that her father was not <prn id='Q741155'>Nycteus</prn> but <pl id='Q2737429'>Asopus</pl>, the river that separates the territories of <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> and <pl id='Q742538'>Plataea</pl>. </p>
<p id='2.6.2'><b>2.6.2</b> This woman <prn id='Q1347568'>Epopeus</prn> carried off but I do not know whether he asked for her hand or adopted a bolder policy from the beginning. The <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> came against him in arms, and in the battle <prn id='Q741155'>Nycteus</prn> was wounded. <prn id='Q1347568'>Epopeus</prn> also was wounded, but won the day. <prn id='Q741155'>Nycteus</prn> they carried back ill to <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>, and when he was about to die he appointed to be regent of <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> his brother <prn id='Q1047047'>Lycus</prn> for <prn id='Q847005'>Labdacus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q1061554'>Polydorus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q27613'>Cadmus</prn>, being still a child, was the ward of <prn id='Q741155'>Nycteus</prn>, who on this occasion entrusted the office of guardian to <prn id='Q1047047'>Lycus</prn>. He also besought him to attack <prn id='Q23504981'>Aegialea</prn> with a larger army and bring vengeance upon <prn id='Q1347568'>Epopeus</prn>; <prn id='Q461439'>Antiope</prn> herself, if taken, was to be punished. </p>
<p id='2.6.3'><b>2.6.3</b> As to <prn id='Q1347568'>Epopeus</prn>, he forthwith offered sacrifice for his victory and began a temple of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, and when this was complete he prayed the goddess to make known whether the temple was finished to her liking, and after the prayer they say that olive oil flowed before the temple. Afterwards <prn id='Q1347568'>Epopeus</prn> also died of his wound, which he had neglected at first, so that <prn id='Q1047047'>Lycus</prn> had now no need to wage war. For <prn id='Q1801511'>Lamedon</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q1582249'>Coronus</prn>, who became king after <prn id='Q1347568'>Epopeus</prn>, gave up <prn id='Q461439'>Antiope</prn>. As she was being taken to <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> by way of <pl id='Q1328318'>Eleutherae</pl>, she was delivered there on the road. </p>
<p id='2.6.4'><b>2.6.4</b> On this matter <prn id='Q730625'>Asius</prn> the son of Amphiptolemus says in his poem: “<prn id='Q196865'>Zethus</prn> and <prn id='Q242835'>Amphion</prn> had <prn id='Q461439'>Antiope</prn> for their mother, Daughter of <pl id='Q2737429'>Asopus</pl>, the swift, deep-eddying river, Having conceived of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> and <prn id='Q1347568'>Epopeus</prn>, shepherd of peoples. <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> traces their descent to the more august side of their family, and says that they were the first founders of <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>, in my opinion distinguishing the lower city from the <pl id='Q11225429'>Cadmea</pl>. </p>

<p id='2.7.1'><b>2.7.1</b> From that time the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl> became <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn> and their land a part of the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl> territory. The city built by <prn id='Q1422648'>Aegialeus</prn> on the plain was destroyed by <prn id='Q59734'>Demetrius</prn> the son of <prn id='Q200401'>Antigonus</prn>, who founded the modern city near what was once the ancient acropolis. The reason why the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl> grew weak it would be wrong to seek; we must be content with <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>'s saying about <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>: “Many, indeed, are the cities of which he has levelled the strongholds. When they had lost their power there came upon them an earthquake, which almost depopulated their city and took from them many of their famous sights. It damaged also the cities of <pl id='Q193214'>Caria</pl> and <pl id='Q18927'>Lycia</pl>, and the island of <pl id='Q13533316'>Rhodes</pl> was very violently shaken, so that it was thought that the <prn id='Q12737222'>Sibyl</prn> had had her utterance about <pl id='Q13533316'>Rhodes</pl> fulfilled. </p>
<p id='2.7.2'><b>2.7.2</b> When you have come from the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthian</pl> to the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonian</pl> territory you see the tomb of <prn id='Q106779211'>Lycus</prn> the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl>, whoever this <prn id='Q106779211'>Lycus</prn> may be; for I can discover no <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> <prn id='Q106779211'>Lycus</prn> who practised the pentathlon or won a victory at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>. This tomb is a mound of earth, but the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl> themselves usually bury their dead in a uniform manner. They cover the body in the ground, and over it they build a basement of stone upon which they set pillars. Above these they put something very like the pediment of a temple. They add no inscription, except that they give the dead man's name without that of his father and bid him farewell. </p>
<p id='2.7.3'><b>2.7.3</b> After the tomb of <prn id='Q106779211'>Lycus</prn>, but on the other side of the <pl id='Q2866756'>Asopus</pl>, there is on the right the Olympium, and a little farther on, to the left of the road, the grave of <prn id='Q459517'>Eupolis</prn>, the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> comic poet. Farther on, if you turn in the direction of the city, you see the tomb of <prn id='Q115338847'>Xenodice</prn>, who died in childbirth. It has not been made after the native fashion, but so as to harmonize best with the painting, which is very well worth seeing. </p>
<p id='2.7.4'><b>2.7.4</b> Farther on from here is the grave of the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl> who were killed at <pl id='Q2068130'>Pellene</pl>, at <pl id='Q1231662'>Dyme</pl> of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, in <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl> and at <pl id='Q59431661'>Sellasia</pl>. Their story I will relate more fully presently. By the gate they have a spring in a cave, the water of which does not rise out of the earth, but flows down from the roof of the cave. For this reason it is called the Dripping Spring (Stazousa). </p>
<p id='2.7.5'><b>2.7.5</b> On the modern acropolis is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q213440'>Fortune</prn> <prn id='Q420733'>Akraia</prn> (of the Height), and after it one of the <prn id='Q190103'>Dioscuri</prn>. Their images and that of <prn id='Q213440'>Fortune</prn> are xoana. On the stage of the <pl id='Q38280194'>theater</pl> built under the acropolis is a statue of a man with a shield, who they say is <prn id='Q317331'>Aratus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q2390163'>Cleinias</prn>. After the <pl id='Q38280194'>theater</pl> is a temple of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>. The god is of gold and ivory, and by his side are Bacchanals of white marble. These women they say are sacred to <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> and maddened by his inspiration. The <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl> have also some images which are kept secret. These one night in each year they carry to the Dionysion from what they call the Cosmeterium (Tiring-room), and they do so with lighted torches and native hymns. </p>
<p id='2.7.6'><b>2.7.6</b> The first is the one named BaccheusYY, set up by <prn id='Q106779267'>Androdamas</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q3624035'>Phlias</prn>, and this is followed by the one called <prn id='Q107247818'>Lysios</prn> (Deliverer), brought from <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> by the <pl id='Q11225429'>Theban</pl> <prn id='Q119854464'>Phanes</prn> at the command of the <prn id='Q220344'>Pythian priestess</prn>. <prn id='Q119854464'>Phanes</prn> came to <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl> when <prn id='Q311536'>Aristomachus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q329690'>Cleodaeus</prn>, failed to understand the oracle given him, and therefore failed to return to the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl>. As you walk from the Dionysion to the agora you see on the right a temple of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> Limnaia (of the lake). A look shows that the roof has fallen in, but the inhabitants cannot tell whether the image has been removed or how it was destroyed on the spot. </p>
<p id='2.7.7'><b>2.7.7</b> Within the agora is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q611171'>Peitho</prn> [Persuasion]; this too has no image. The worship of <prn id='Q611171'>Persuasion</prn> was established among them for the following reason. When <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> and <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> had killed <prn id='Q15721'>Python</prn> they came to <prn id='Q23504981'>Aegialea</prn> to obtain purification. Dread coming upon them at the place now named <prn id='Q105019'>Phobos</prn> [Fear], they turned aside to <prn id='Q11912529'>Carmanor</prn> in <pl id='Q4752820'>Crete</pl>, and the people of <prn id='Q23504981'>Aegialea</prn> were smitten by a plague. When the seers bade them propitiate <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> and <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, </p>
<p id='2.7.8'><b>2.7.8</b> they sent seven boys and seven maidens as suppliants to the river <pl id='Q94578661'>Sythas</pl>. They say that the deities, persuaded by these, came to what was then the acropolis, and the place that they reached first is the sanctuary of <prn id='Q611171'>Persuasion</prn>. Conformable with this story is the ceremony they perform at the present day; the children go to the <pl id='Q94578661'>Sythas</pl> at the feast of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, and having brought, as they pretend, the deities to the sanctuary of <prn id='Q611171'>Persuasion</prn>, they say that they take them back again to the temple of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>. The temple stands in the modern agora, and was originally, it is said, made by <prn id='Q644604'>Proetus</prn>, because in this place his <prn id='Q11827646'>daughters</prn> recovered from their madness. </p>
<p id='2.7.9'><b>2.7.9</b> It is also said that in this temple <prn id='Q321541'>Meleager</prn> dedicated the spear with which he slew the <prn id='Q654379'>boar</prn>. There is also a story that the flutes of <prn id='Q599737'>Marsyas</prn> are dedicated here. When the <prn id='Q9348775'>Silenus</prn> met with his disaster, the river <prn id='Q599737'>Marsyas</prn> carried the flutes to the <pl id='Q211089'>Maeander</pl>; reappearing in the <pl id='Q2866756'>Asopus</pl> they were cast ashore in the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonian</pl> territory and given to <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> by the shepherd who found them. I found none of these offerings still in existence, for they were destroyed by fire when the temple was burnt. The temple that I saw, and its image, were dedicated by <prn id='Q115340816'>Pythocles</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.8.1'><b>2.8.1</b> The precinct near the sanctuary of <prn id='Q611171'>Persuasion</prn> that is devoted to <prn id='Q1235185'>Roman emperors</prn> was once the house of the tyrant <prn id='Q19560256'>Cleon</prn>. He became tyrant in the modern city; there was another tyranny while the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl> still lived in the lower city, that of <prn id='Q359545'>Cleisthenes</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q12079024'>Aristonymus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q192211'>Myron</prn>. Before this house is a hero-shrine of <prn id='Q317331'>Aratus</prn>, whose achievements eclipsed those of all contemporary Greeks. His history is as follows. </p>
<p id='2.8.2'><b>2.8.2</b> After the despotism of <prn id='Q19560256'>Cleon</prn>, many of those in authority were seized with such an ungovernable passion for tyranny that two actually became tyrants together, <prn id='Q5414525'>Euthydemus</prn> and <prn id='Q7806900'>Timocleidas</prn>. These were expelled by the people, who made <prn id='Q2390163'>Cleinias</prn>, the father of <prn id='Q317331'>Aratus</prn>, their champion. A few years afterwards <prn id='Q305524'>Abantidas</prn> became tyrant. Before this time <prn id='Q2390163'>Cleinias</prn> had met his death, and <prn id='Q317331'>Aratus</prn> went into exile, either of his own accord or because he was compelled to do so by <prn id='Q305524'>Abantidas</prn>. Now <prn id='Q305524'>Abantidas</prn> was killed by some natives, and his father <prn id='Q715208'>Paseas</prn> immediately became tyrant. </p>
<p id='2.8.3'><b>2.8.3</b> He was killed by <prn id='Q715309'>Nicocles</prn>, who succeeded him. This <prn id='Q715309'>Nicocles</prn> was attacked by <prn id='Q317331'>Aratus</prn> with a force of <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonian</pl> exiles and <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl> mercenaries. Making his attempt by night, he eluded some of the defenders in the darkness; the others he overcame, and forced his way within the wall. Day was now breaking, and taking the populace with him he hastened to the tyrant's house. This he easily captured, but <prn id='Q715309'>Nicocles</prn> himself succeeded in making his escape. <prn id='Q317331'>Aratus</prn> restored equality of political rights to the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl>, striking a bargain for those in exile; he restored to them their houses and all their other possessions which had been sold, compensating the buyers out of his own purse. </p>
<p id='2.8.4'><b>2.8.4</b> Moreover, as all the Greeks were afraid of the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> and of <prn id='Q108816'>Antigonus</prn>, the guardian of <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q313847'>Demetrius</prn>, he induced the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl>, who were <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn>, to join the <prn id='Q244796'>Achaean League</prn>. He was immediately elected general by the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, and leading them against the <pl id='Q4894785'>Locrians</pl> of <pl id='Q38281545'>Amphissa</pl> and into the land of the <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolians</pl>, their enemies, he ravaged their territory. <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl> was held by <prn id='Q241386'>Antigonus</prn>, and there was a <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonian</pl> garrison in the city, but he threw them into a panic by the suddenness of his assault, winning a battle and killing among others <prn id='Q662932'>Persaeus</prn>, the commander of the garrison, who had studied philosophy under <prn id='Q171303'>Zeno</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q1230889'>Mnaseas</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.8.5'><b>2.8.5</b> When <prn id='Q317331'>Aratus</prn> had liberated <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl>, the <prn id='Q244796'>League</prn> was joined by the <pl id='Q233576'>Epidaurians</pl> and <pl id='Q581494'>Troezenians</pl> inhabiting <prn id='Q25044670'>Argolian Acte</prn>, and by the <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarians</pl> among those beyond the <pl id='Q215200'>Isthmus</pl>, while <prn id='Q39602'>Ptolemy</prn> made an alliance with the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>. The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> and king <prn id='Q299479'>Agis</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q889042'>Eudamidas</prn>, surprised and took <pl id='Q2068130'>Pellene</pl> by a sudden onslaught, but when <prn id='Q317331'>Aratus</prn> and his army arrived they were defeated in an engagement, evacuated <pl id='Q2068130'>Pellene</pl>, and returned home under a truce. </p>
<p id='2.8.6'><b>2.8.6</b> After his success in the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl>, <prn id='Q317331'>Aratus</prn> thought it a shame to allow the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> to hold unchallenged <pl id='Q13426467'>Peiraeus</pl>, <pl id='Q1611219'>Munychia</pl>, <pl id='Q202422'>Salamis</pl>, and <pl id='Q1136637'>Sunium</pl>; but not expecting to be able to take them by force he bribed <prn id='Q1226800'>Diogenes</prn>, the commander of the garrisons, to give up the positions for a hundred and fifty talents, himself helping the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> by contributing a sixth part of the sum. He induced <prn id='Q311536'>Aristomachus</prn> also, the tyrant of <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>, to restore to the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> their democracy and to join the <prn id='Q244796'>Achaean League</prn>; he captured <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantinea</pl> from the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> who held it. But no man finds all his plans turn out according to his liking, and even <prn id='Q317331'>Aratus</prn> was compelled to become an ally of the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> and <prn id='Q108816'>Antigonus</prn> in the following way. </p>
<p id='2.9.1'><b>2.9.1</b> <prn id='Q310811'>Cleomenes</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q173795'>Leonidas</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q930518'>Cleonymus</prn>, having succeeded to the kingship at <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>, resembled <prn id='Q314518'>Pausanias</prn> in being dissatisfied with the established constitution and in aiming at a tyranny. A more fiery man than <prn id='Q314518'>Pausanias</prn>, and no coward, he quickly succeeded by spirit and daring in accomplishing all his ambition. He poisoned <prn id='Q911113'>Eurydamidas</prn>, the king of the other royal house, while yet a boy, raised to the throne by means of the ephors his brother <prn id='Q954786'>Epicleidas</prn>, destroyed the power of the <prn id='Q495552'>Senate</prn>, and appointed in its stead a nominal <prn id='Q12883294'>Council of Fathers</prn>. Ambitious for greater things and for supremacy over the Greeks, he first attacked the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, hoping if successful to have them as allies, and especially wishing that they should not hinder his activities. </p>
<p id='2.9.2'><b>2.9.2</b> Engaging them at <pl id='Q1231662'>Dyme</pl> beyond <pl id='Q133123'>Patrae</pl>, <prn id='Q317331'>Aratus</prn> being still leader of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, he won the victory. In fear for the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> and for <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl> itself, <prn id='Q317331'>Aratus</prn> was forced by this defeat to bring in <prn id='Q108816'>Antigonus</prn> as an ally. <prn id='Q310811'>Cleomenes</prn> had violated the peace which he had made with <prn id='Q108816'>Antigonus</prn> and had openly acted in many ways contrary to treaty, especially in laying waste <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl>. So <prn id='Q108816'>Antigonus</prn> crossed into the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl> and the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> met <prn id='Q310811'>Cleomenes</prn> at <pl id='Q59431661'>Sellasia</pl>.

<p id='2.9.3'><b>2.9.3</b> but of the children of <prn id='Q173795'>Leonidas</prn>, <prn id='Q954786'>Epicleidas</prn> was killed in the battle, and <prn id='Q310811'>Cleomenes</prn> fled to <pl id='Q11768'>Egypt</pl>.

He made his escape from prison and began a riot among the <pl id='Q87'>Alexandrians</pl>, but at last, on being captured, he fell by his own hand. The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, glad to be rid of <prn id='Q310811'>Cleomenes</prn>, refused to be ruled by kings any longer, but the rest of their ancient constitution they have kept to the present day. <prn id='Q108816'>Antigonus</prn> remained a constant friend of <prn id='Q317331'>Aratus</prn>, looking upon him as a benefactor who hid helped him to accomplish brilliant deeds. </p>
<p id='2.9.4'><b>2.9.4</b> But when <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn> succeeded to the throne, since <prn id='Q317331'>Aratus</prn> did not approve of his violent treatment of his subjects, and in some cases even opposed the accomplishment of his purposes, he killed <prn id='Q317331'>Aratus</prn> by giving him secretly a dose of poison. This fate came upon <prn id='Q317331'>Aratus</prn> at <pl id='Q60790078'>Aegium</pl>, from which place he was carried to <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl> and buried, and there is still in that city the hero-shrine of <prn id='Q317331'>Aratus</prn>. <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn> treated two <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, <prn id='Q15623802'>Eurycleides</prn> and <prn id='Q1387790'>Micon</prn>, in a similar way. These men also, who were orators enjoying the confidence of the people, he killed by poison. </p>
<p id='2.9.5'><b>2.9.5</b> After all, <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn> himself in his turn was fated to suffer disaster through the fatal cup. <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn>'s son, <prn id='Q1185467'>Demetrius</prn>, was poisoned by <prn id='Q207363'>Perseus</prn>, his younger son, and grief at the murder brought the father also to his grave. I mention the incident in passing, with my mind turned to the inspired words of the poet <prn id='Q44233'>Hesiod</prn>, that he who plots mischief against his neighbor directs it first to himself. </p>
<p id='2.9.6'><b>2.9.6</b> After the hero-shrine of <prn id='Q317331'>Aratus</prn> is an altar to <prn id='Q107349789'>Isthmian</prn> <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, and also a <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q1637673'>Meilichius</prn> (Gracious) and an <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> named <prn id='Q11940519'>Patroa</prn> (ancestral), both of them very inartistic works. The <prn id='Q1637673'>Meilichius</prn> is like a pyramid, the <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> like a pillar. Here too stand their council-chamber and a stoa called Cleisthenean from the name of him who built it. It was built from spoils by <prn id='Q207634'>Cleisthenes</prn>, who helped the <prn id='Q182875'>Amphictyons</prn> in the war at <pl id='Q56754242'>Cirrha</pl>. In the agora under the open sky is a bronze <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, a work of <prn id='Q192222'>Lysippus</prn>, and by the side of it a gilded <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.9.7'><b>2.9.7</b> Hard by is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> <prn id='Q6707302'>Lycius</prn> (Wolf-god), now fallen into ruins and not worth any attention. For <prn id='Q18498'>wolves</prn> once so preyed upon their flocks that there was no longer any profit therefrom, and the god, mentioning a certain place where lay a dry log, gave an oracle that the bark of this log mixed with meat was to be set out for the beasts to eat. As soon as they tasted it the bark killed them, and that log lay in my time in the sanctuary of the Wolf-god, but not even the guides of the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl> knew what kind of tree it was. </p>
<p id='2.9.8'><b>2.9.8</b> Next after this are bronze portrait statues, said to be the <prn id='Q11827646'>daughters</prn> of <prn id='Q644604'>Proetus</prn>, but the inscription I found referred to other women. Here there is a bronze <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, made by <prn id='Q192222'>Lysippus</prn> the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonian</pl>, and hard by stands <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> <prn id='Q21548139'>Agoraeus</prn> (of the Market-place). </p>
<p id='2.10.1'><b>2.10.1</b> In the gymnasium not far from the agora is dedicated a stone <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> made by <prn id='Q309579'>Scopas</prn>. There is also in another place a sanctuary of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>. The whole of the enclosure here they name Paedize; in the middle of the enclosure is the sanctuary, and in it is an old wooden figure carved by <prn id='Q20100871'>Laphaes</prn> the <pl id='Q1412043'>Phliasian</pl>. I will now describe the ritual at the festival. The story is that on coming to the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonian</pl> land <prn id='Q1465809'>Phaestus</prn> found the people giving offerings to <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> as to a hero. <prn id='Q1465809'>Phaestus</prn> then refused to do anything of the kind, but insisted on sacrificing to him as to a god. Even at the present day the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl>, after slaying a lamb and burning the thighs upon the altar, eat some of the meat as part of a victim given to a god, while the rest they offer as to a hero. The first day of the festival in honor of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> they name . . .; the second they call Heraclea. </p>
<p id='2.10.2'><b>2.10.2</b> From here is a way to a sanctuary of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>. On passing into the enclosure you see on the left a building with two rooms. In the outer room lies a figure of <prn id='Q189347'>Hypnos</prn> (Sleep), of which nothing remains now except the head. The inner room is given over to the <prn id='Q671534'>Carnean</prn> <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>; into it none may enter except the priests. In the stoa lies a huge bone of a sea-monster, and after it an image of <prn id='Q578584'>Oneiros</prn> (Dream) and <prn id='Q189347'>Hypnos</prn>, surnamed <prn id='Q5382860'>Epidotes</prn> (Bountiful), lulling to sleep a <prn id='Q140'>lion</prn>. Within the sanctuary on either side of the entrance is an image, on the one hand <prn id='Q132582'>Pan</prn> seated, on the other <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> standing. </p>
<p id='2.10.3'><b>2.10.3</b> When you have entered you see the god, a beardless figure of gold and ivory made by <prn id='Q918382'>Calamis</prn>. He holds a staff in one hand, and a cone of the cultivated pine in the other. The <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl> say that the god was carried to them from <pl id='Q233576'>Epidaurus</pl> on a carriage drawn by two mules, that he was in the likeness of a <prn id='Q2102'>serpent</prn>, and that he was brought by Nicagora of <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl>, the mother of Agasicles and the wife of <prn id='Q9250184'>Echetimus</prn>. Here are small figures hanging from the roof. She who is on the <prn id='Q2102'>serpent</prn> they say is <prn id='Q18353959'>Aristodama</prn>, the mother of <prn id='Q317331'>Aratus</prn>, whom they hold to be a son of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.10.4'><b>2.10.4</b> Such are the noteworthy things that this enclosure presented to me, and opposite is another enclosure, sacred to <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>. The first thing inside is a statue of <prn id='Q461439'>Antiope</prn>. They say that her sons were <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl>, and because of them the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl> will have it that <prn id='Q461439'>Antiope</prn> herself is related to themselves. After this is the sanctuary of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>, into which enter only a female neokoros (verger), who after her appointment may not have intercourse with a man, and a virgin, called the Bath-bearer, holding her sacred office for a year. All others are wont to behold the goddess from the entrance, and to pray from that place. </p>
<p id='2.10.5'><b>2.10.5</b> The image, which is seated, was made by the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonian</pl> <prn id='Q1723440'>Canachus</prn>, who also fashioned the <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> at <pl id='Q671358'>Didyma</pl> of the <pl id='Q169460'>Milesians</pl>, and the <pl id='Q106526588'>Ismenian</pl> <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> for the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl>. It is made of gold and ivory, having on its head a polos, and carrying in one hand a poppy and in the other an apple. They offer the thighs of the victims, excepting pigs; the other parts they burn for the goddess with juniper wood, but as the thighs are burning they add to the offering a leaf of the paideros. </p>
<p id='2.10.6'><b>2.10.6</b> This is a plant in the open parts of the enclosure, and it grows nowhere else either in <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonia</pl> or in any other land. Its leaves are smaller than those of the esculent oak, but larger than those of the holm; the shape is similar to that of the oak-leaf. One side is of a dark color, the other is white. You might best compare the color to that of white-poplar leaves. </p>
<p id='2.10.7'><b>2.10.7</b> Ascending from here to the gymnasium you see in the right a sanctuary of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> <prn id='Q107289283'>Pheraea</prn>. It is said that the wooden image was brought from <pl id='Q1330631'>Pherae</pl>. This gymnasium was built for the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl> by <prn id='Q2390163'>Cleinias</prn>, and they still train the youths here. White marble images are here, an <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> wrought only to the waist, and a <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> whose lower parts are similar to the square Hermae. </p>
<p id='2.11.1'><b>2.11.1</b> Turning away from here towards the gate called Holy you see, not far from the gate, a temple of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>. Dedicated long ago by <prn id='Q1347568'>Epopeus</prn>, it surpassed all its contemporaries in size and splendor. Yet the memory of even this was doomed to perish through lapse of time — the god burned it down by lightning — but the altar there, which escaped injury, remains down to the present day as <prn id='Q1347568'>Epopeus</prn> made it. Before the altar a barrow has been raised for <prn id='Q1347568'>Epopeus</prn> himself, and near the grave are the gods <prn id='Q25338401'>Apotropaioi</prn> (Averters of evil). Near them the Greeks perform such rites as they are wont to do in order to avert misfortunes. They say that the neighboring sanctuary of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> and <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> was also made by <prn id='Q1347568'>Epopeus</prn>, and that of <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> after it by <prn id='Q223152'>Adrastus</prn>. I found no images remaining in either. Behind the sanctuary of <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> he built an altar to <prn id='Q132582'>Pan</prn>, and one to <prn id='Q134270'>Helius</prn> (Sun) made of white marble. </p>
<p id='2.11.2'><b>2.11.2</b> On the way down to the plain is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>, said to have been founded by <prn id='Q44060'>Plemnaeus</prn> as a thank-offering to the goddess for the rearing of his son. A little farther away from the sanctuary of <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> founded by <prn id='Q223152'>Adrastus</prn> is a temple of the <prn id='Q671534'>Carnean</prn> <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>. Only the pillars are standing in it; you will no longer find there walls or roof, nor yet in that of <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> <prn id='Q107355018'>Prodromia</prn> (Pioneer). This temple was founded by <prn id='Q1518328'>Phalces</prn>, son of <prn id='Q636796'>Temenus</prn>, who asserted that <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> guided him on the road to <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl>. </p>
<p id='2.11.3'><b>2.11.3</b> On the direct road from <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl> to <pl id='Q1412043'>Phlius</pl>, on the left of the road and just about ten stades from it, is a grove called Pyraea, and in it a sanctuary of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> <prn id='Q107294383'>Prostasia</prn> (protectress) and <prn id='Q45967'>Kore</prn>. Here the men celebrate a festival by themselves, giving up to the women the so-called NymphonYY for the purposes of their festival. In the NymphonYY are images of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>, <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>, and <prn id='Q45967'>Kore</prn>, with only their faces exposed. The road to <pl id='Q59637009'>Titane</pl> is sixty stades long, and too narrow to be used by carriages drawn by a yoke. </p>
<p id='2.11.4'><b>2.11.4</b> At a distance along it, in my opinion, of twenty stades, to the left on the other side of the <pl id='Q2866756'>Asopus</pl>, is a grove of holm oaks and a temple of the goddesses named by the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> the <prn id='Q180262'>Semnai</prn> (August ones), and by the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl> the Eumenides (kindly ones). On one day in each year they celebrate a festival to them and offer <prn id='Q7368'>sheep</prn> big with young as a burnt offering, and they are accustomed to use a libation of honey and water, and flowers instead of garlands. They practise similar rites at the altar of the <prn id='Q180287'>Fates</prn>; it is in an open space in the grove. </p>
<p id='2.11.5'><b>2.11.5</b> On turning back to the road, and having crossed the <pl id='Q2866756'>Asopus</pl> again and reached the summit of the hill, you come to the place where the natives say that <prn id='Q45713'>Titan</prn> first dwelt. They add that he was the brother of <prn id='Q134270'>Helius</prn> (Sun), and that after him the place got the name <pl id='Q59637009'>Titane</pl>. My own view is that he proved clever at observing the seasons of the year and the times when the sun increases and ripens seeds and fruits, and for this reason was held to be the brother of <prn id='Q134270'>Helius</prn>. Afterwards <prn id='Q1408128'>Alexanor</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q674319'>Machaon</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>, came to <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonia</pl> and built the sanctuary of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> at <pl id='Q59637009'>Titane</pl>. </p>
<p id='2.11.6'><b>2.11.6</b> The neighbors are chiefly servants of the god, and within the enclosure are old cypress trees. One cannot learn of what wood or metal the image is, nor do they know the name of the maker, though one or two attribute it to <prn id='Q1408128'>Alexanor</prn> himself. Of the image can be seen only the face, hands, and feet, for it has about it a tunic of white wool and a cloak. There is a similar image of <prn id='Q202257'>Health</prn>; this, too, one cannot see easily because it is so surrounded with the locks of women, who cut them off and offer them to the goddess, and with strips of <pl id='Q5684'>Babylonian</pl> raiment. With whichever of these a votary here is willing to propitiate heaven, the same instructions have been given to him, to worship this image which they are pleased to call <prn id='Q202257'>Health</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.11.7'><b>2.11.7</b> There are images also of <prn id='Q1408128'>Alexanor</prn> and of <prn id='Q16332133'>Euamerion</prn>; to the former they give offerings as to a hero after the setting of the sun; to <prn id='Q16332133'>Euamerion</prn>, as being a god, they give burnt sacrifices. If I conjecture aright, the <pl id='Q18986'>Pergamenes</pl>, in accordance with an oracle, call this <prn id='Q16332133'>Euamerion</prn> <prn id='Q2401991'>Telesphorus</prn> (Accomplisher) while the <pl id='Q233576'>Epidaurians</pl> call him <prn id='Q115379458'>Acesis</prn> (Cure). There is also a wooden image of <prn id='Q725286'>Coronis</prn>, but it has no fixed position anywhere in the temple. While to the god are being sacrificed a <prn id='Q693690'>bull</prn>, a lamb, and a pig, they remove <prn id='Q725286'>Coronis</prn> to the sanctuary of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> and honor her there. The parts of the victims which they offer as a burnt sacrifice, and they are not content with cutting out the thighs, they burn on the ground, except the birds, which they burn on the altar. </p>
<p id='2.11.8'><b>2.11.8</b> In the gable at the ends are figures of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> and of Victories. In the stoa are dedicated images of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> and <prn id='Q131575'>Hecate</prn>, with <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>, the <prn id='Q334486'>Mother</prn> of the gods, and <prn id='Q213440'>Fortune</prn>. These are wooden, but <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>, surnamed <pl id='Q1136193'>Gortynian</pl>, is of stone. They are unwilling to enter among the sacred <prn id='Q2102'>serpents</prn> through fear, but they place their food before the entrance and take no further trouble. Within the enclosure is a bronze statue of a <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonian</pl> named <prn id='Q19720593'>Granianus</prn>, who won the following victories at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>: the pentathlon twice, the foot-race, the double-course foot-race twice, once without and once with the shield. </p>
<p id='2.12.1'><b>2.12.1</b> In <pl id='Q59637009'>Titane</pl> there is also a sanctuary of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, into which they bring up the image of <prn id='Q725286'>Coronis</prn>. In it is an old wooden figure of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, and I was told that it, too, was struck by lightning. The sanctuary is built upon a hill, at the bottom of which is an Altar of the Winds, and on it the priest sacrifices to the winds one night in every year. He also performs other secret rites at four pits, taming the fierceness of the blasts, and he is said to chant as well charms of <prn id='Q174278'>Medea</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.12.2'><b>2.12.2</b> On reaching <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl> from <pl id='Q59637009'>Titane</pl>, as you go down to the shore you see on the left of the road a temple of <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> having now neither image nor roof. They say that its founder was <prn id='Q644604'>Proetus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q644604'>Abas</prn>. When you have gone down to the harbor called the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl>' and turned towards <pl id='Q16326973'>Aristonautae</pl>, the Port of <pl id='Q2068130'>Pellene</pl>, you see a little above the road on the left hand a sanctuary of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>. Farther along the highway is a river called the <pl id='Q3723337'>Helisson</pl>, and after it the <pl id='Q94578661'>Sythas</pl>, both emptying themselves into the sea. </p>
<p id='2.12.3'><b>2.12.3</b> <pl id='Q1412043'>Phliasia</pl> borders on <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonia</pl>. The city is just about forty stades distant from <pl id='Q59637009'>Titane</pl>, and there is a straight road to it from <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl>. That the <pl id='Q1412043'>Phliasians</pl> are in no way related to the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> is shown by the passage in <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> that deals with the list of the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl>, in which the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl> are not included among the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadian</pl> confederates. As my narrative progresses it will become clear that they were <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl> originally, and became <prn id='Q203711'>Dorian</prn> later after the return of the <prn id='Q828084'>Heracleidae</prn> to the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl>. I know that most of the traditions concerning the <pl id='Q1412043'>Phliasians</pl> are contradictory, but I shall make use of those which have been most generally accepted. </p>
<p id='2.12.4'><b>2.12.4</b> They say that the first man in this land was <prn id='Q4784290'>Aras</prn>, who sprang from the soil. He founded a city around that hillock which even down to our day is called the Arantine Hill, not far distant from a second hill on which the <pl id='Q1412043'>Phliasians</pl> have their acropolis and their sanctuary of <prn id='Q131125'>Hebe</prn>. Here, then, he founded a city, and after him in ancient times both the land and the city were called Arantia. While he was king, <prn id='Q622781'>Asopus</prn>, said to be the son of <prn id='Q57157139'>Celusa</prn> and <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, discovered for him the water of the river which the present inhabitants call after him <pl id='Q2866756'>Asopus</pl>. The tomb of <prn id='Q4784290'>Aras</prn> is in the place called <prn id='Q115380594'>Celeae</prn>, where they say is also buried <prn id='Q4162118'>Dysaules</prn> of <pl id='Q11918833'>Eleusis</pl>. </p>
<p id='2.12.5'><b>2.12.5</b> <prn id='Q4784290'>Aras</prn> had a son <prn id='Q115379640'>Aoris</prn> and a daughter <prn id='Q29654284'>Araethyrea</prn>, who, the <pl id='Q1412043'>Phliasians</pl> say, were experienced hunters and brave warriors. <prn id='Q29654284'>Araethyrea</prn> died first, and <prn id='Q115379640'>Aoris</prn>, in memory of his sister, changed the name of the land to <pl id='Q16488711'>Araethyrea</pl>. This is why <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>, in making a list of <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn>'s subjects, has the verse: “<pl id='Q7103538'>Orneae</pl> was their home and <pl id='Q16488711'>Araethyrea</pl> the delightful.” The graves of the children of <prn id='Q4784290'>Aras</prn> are, in my opinion, on the Arantine Hill and not in any other part of the land. On the top of them are far-seen gravestones, and before the celebration of the mysteries of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> the people look at these tombs and call <prn id='Q4784290'>Aras</prn> and his children to the libations. </p>
<p id='2.12.6'><b>2.12.6</b> The <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> say that <prn id='Q3624035'>Phlias</prn>, who has given the land its third name, was the son of <prn id='Q1738025'>Ceisus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q636796'>Temenus</prn>. This account I can by no means accept, but I know that he is called a son of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>, and that he is said to have been one of those who sailed on the <prn id='Q317932'>Argo</prn>. The verses of the <prn id='Q192638'>Rhodian poet</prn> confirm me in my opinion: <br>“Came after these <prn id='Q3624035'>Phlias</prn> from <pl id='Q16488711'>Araethyrea</pl> to the muster; <br>Here did he dwell and prosper, because <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> his father <br>Cared for him well, and his home was near to the springs of <pl id='Q2866756'>Asopus</pl>.” <br>The account goes on to say that the mother of <prn id='Q3624035'>Phlias</prn> was <prn id='Q29654284'>Araethyrea</prn> and not <prn id='Q827221'>Chthonophyle</prn>. The latter was his wife and bore him <prn id='Q106779267'>Androdamas</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.13.1'><b>2.13.1</b> On the return of the <prn id='Q828084'>Heracleidae</prn> disturbances took place throughout the whole of the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl> except <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl>, so that many of the cities received additional settlers from the <prn id='Q203711'>Dorian</prn> race, and their inhabitants suffered yet more revolutions. The history of <pl id='Q1412043'>Phlius</pl> is as follows. The <prn id='Q203711'>Dorian</prn> <prn id='Q2147429'>Rhegnidas</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q1518328'>Phalces</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q636796'>Temenus</prn>, attacked it from <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> and <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonia</pl>. Some of the <pl id='Q1412043'>Phliasians</pl> were inclined to accept the offer of <prn id='Q2147429'>Rhegnidas</prn>, which was that they should remain on their own estates and receive <prn id='Q2147429'>Rhegnidas</prn> as their king, giving the <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn> with him a share in the land. </p>
<p id='2.13.2'><b>2.13.2</b> <prn id='Q115379810'>Hippasus</prn> and his party, on the other hand, urged the citizens to defend themselves, and not to give up many advantages to the <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn> without striking a blow. The people, however, accepted the opposite policy, and so <prn id='Q115379810'>Hippasus</prn> and any others who wished fled to <pl id='Q13580795'>Samos</pl>. Great-grandson of this <prn id='Q115379810'>Hippasus</prn> was <prn id='Q10261'>Pythagoras</prn>, the celebrated sage. For <prn id='Q10261'>Pythagoras</prn> was the son of <prn id='Q2565673'>Mnesarchus</prn>, the son of Euphron [or Euphranor?], the son of <prn id='Q115379810'>Hippasus</prn>. This is the account the <pl id='Q1412043'>Phliasians</pl> give about themselves, and the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl> in general agree with them. </p>
<p id='2.13.3'><b>2.13.3</b> I will now add an account of the most remarkable of their famous sights. On the <pl id='Q1412043'>Phliasian</pl> acropolis is a grove of cypress trees and a sanctuary which from ancient times has been held to be peculiarly holy. The earliest <pl id='Q1412043'>Phliasians</pl> named the goddess to whom the sanctuary belongs Ganymeda; but later authorities call her <prn id='Q131125'>Hebe</prn>, whom <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> mentions in the duel between <prn id='Q171839'>Menelaus</prn> and <prn id='Q167646'>Alexander</prn>, saying that she was the cup-bearer of the gods; and again he says, in the descent of <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn> to <pl id='Q1521549'>Hades</pl>, that she was the wife of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>. <prn id='Q978308'>Olen</prn>, in his hymn to <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn>, says that <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> was reared by the <prn id='Q201411'>Seasons</prn>, and that her children were <prn id='Q40901'>Ares</prn> and <prn id='Q131125'>Hebe</prn>. Of the honors that the <pl id='Q1412043'>Phliasians</pl> pay to this goddess the greatest is the pardoning of suppliants. </p>
<p id='2.13.4'><b>2.13.4</b> All those who seek sanctuary here receive full forgiveness, and prisoners, when set free, dedicate their fetters on the trees in the grove. The <pl id='Q1412043'>Phliasians</pl> also celebrate a yearly festival which they call Ivy-cutters. There is no image, either kept in secret or openly displayed, and the reason for this is set forth in a sacred legend of theirs though on the left as you go out is a temple of <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> with an image of <pl id='Q65040323'>Parian</pl> marble. </p>
<p id='2.13.5'><b>2.13.5</b> On the acropolis is another enclosure, which is sacred to <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>, and in it are a temple and statue of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> and her daughter. Here there is also a bronze statue of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, which appeared to me to be ancient. As you go down from the acropolis you see on the right a temple of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> with an image of the god as a beardless youth. Below this temple is built a theater. Not far from it is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> and old, seated images. </p>
<p id='2.13.6'><b>2.13.6</b> On the agora is a votive offering, a bronze she-<prn id='Q2934'>goat</prn> for the most part covered with gold. The following is the reason why it has received honors among the <pl id='Q1412043'>Phliasians</pl>. The constellation which they call the <prn id='Q2934'>Goat</prn> on its rising causes continual damage to the vines. In order that they may suffer nothing unpleasant from it, the <pl id='Q1412043'>Phliasians</pl> pay honors to the bronze <prn id='Q2934'>goat</prn> on the agora and adorn the image with gold. Here also is the tomb of <prn id='Q3622659'>Aristias</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q1362371'>Pratinas</prn>. This <prn id='Q3622659'>Aristias</prn> and his father <prn id='Q1362371'>Pratinas</prn> composed <prn id='Q1050848'>satyric plays</prn> more popular than any save those of <prn id='Q40939'>Aeschylus</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.13.7'><b>2.13.7</b> Behind the agora is a building which the <pl id='Q1412043'>Phliasians</pl> name the House of Divination. Into it <prn id='Q330584'>Amphiaraus</prn> entered, slept the night there, and then first, say the <pl id='Q1412043'>Phliasians</pl>, began to divine. According to their account <prn id='Q330584'>Amphiaraus</prn> was for a time an ordinary person and no diviner. Ever since that time the building has been shut up. Not far away is what is called the Omphalos (Navel), the center of all the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl>, if they speak the truth about it. Farther on from the Omphalos they have an old sanctuary of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>, a sanctuary of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, and one of <prn id='Q79876'>Isis</prn>. The image of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> is visible to all, and so also is that of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, but the image of <prn id='Q79876'>Isis</prn> only the priests may behold. </p>
<p id='2.13.8'><b>2.13.8</b> The <pl id='Q1412043'>Phliasians</pl> tell also the following legend. When <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> came back safe from <pl id='Q2370577'>Libya</pl>, bringing the apples of the <prn id='Q206187'>Hesperides</prn>, as they were called, he visited <pl id='Q1412043'>Phlius</pl> on some private matter. While he was staying there <prn id='Q749966'>Oeneus</prn> came to him from <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolia</pl>. He had already allied himself to the family of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, and after his arrival on this occasion either he entertained <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> or <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> entertained him. Be this as it may, displeased with the drink given him <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> struck on the head with one of his fingers the boy <prn id='Q12879770'>Cyathus</prn>, the cup-bearer of <prn id='Q749966'>Oeneus</prn>, who died on the spot from the blow. A chapel keeps the memory of the deed fresh among the <pl id='Q1412043'>Phliasians</pl>; it is built by the side of the sanctuary of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, and it contains statues made of stone representing Cyathus holding out a cup to <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.14.1'><b>2.14.1</b> <prn id='Q115380594'>Celeae</prn> is some five stades distant from the city, and here they celebrate the mysteries in honor of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>, not every year but every fourth year. The <prn id='Q1443775'>hierophant</prn> is not appointed for life, but at each celebration they elect a fresh one, who takes, if he cares to do so, a wife. In this respect their custom differs from that at <pl id='Q94299853'>Eleusis</pl>, but the actual celebration is modelled on the <pl id='Q94299853'>Eleusinian</pl> rites. The <pl id='Q1412043'>Phliasians</pl> themselves admit that they copy the “performance” at <pl id='Q94299853'>Eleusis</pl>. </p>
<p id='2.14.2'><b>2.14.2</b> They say that it was <prn id='Q4162118'>Dysaules</prn>, the brother of <prn id='Q1141300'>Celeus</prn>, who came to their land and established the mysteries, and that he had been expelled from <pl id='Q11918833'>Eleusis</pl> by <prn id='Q853462'>Ion</prn>, when <prn id='Q853462'>Ion</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q514746'>Xuthus</prn>, was chosen by the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> to be commander-in-chief in the <pl id='Q11918833'>Eleusinian</pl> war. Now I cannot possibly agree with the <pl id='Q1412043'>Phliasians</pl> in supposing that an <pl id='Q11918833'>Eleusinian</pl> was conquered in battle and driven away into exile, for the war terminated in a treaty before it was fought out, and <prn id='Q1125049'>Eumolpus</prn> himself remained at <pl id='Q11918833'>Eleusis</pl>. </p>
<p id='2.14.3'><b>2.14.3</b> But it is possible that <prn id='Q4162118'>Dysaules</prn> came to <pl id='Q1412043'>Phlius</pl> for some other reason than that given by the <pl id='Q1412043'>Phliasians</pl>. I do not believe either that he was related to <prn id='Q1141300'>Celeus</prn>, or that he was in any way distinguished at <pl id='Q11918833'>Eleusis</pl>, otherwise <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> would never have passed him by in his poems. For <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> is one of those who have written in honor of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>, and when he is making a list of those to whom the goddess taught the mysteries he knows nothing of an <pl id='Q11918833'>Eleusinian</pl> named <prn id='Q4162118'>Dysaules</prn>. These are the verses: <br>“She to <prn id='Q269243'>Triptolemus</prn> taught, and to <prn id='Q1226883'>Diocles</prn>, driver of <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn>, <br>Also to mighty <prn id='Q1125049'>Eumolpus</prn>, to <prn id='Q1141300'>Celeus</prn>, leader of peoples, <br>Cult of the holy rites, to them all her mystery telling. </p>
<p id='2.14.4'><b>2.14.4</b> At all events, this <prn id='Q4162118'>Dysaules</prn>, according to the <pl id='Q1412043'>Phliasians</pl>, established the mysteries here, and he it was who gave to the place the name <prn id='Q115380594'>Celeae</prn>. I have already said that the tomb of <prn id='Q4162118'>Dysaules</prn> is here. So the grave of <prn id='Q4784290'>Aras</prn> was made earlier, for according to the account of the <pl id='Q1412043'>Phliasians</pl> <prn id='Q4162118'>Dysaules</prn> did not arrive in the reign of <prn id='Q4784290'>Aras</prn>, but later. For <prn id='Q4784290'>Aras</prn>, they say, was a contemporary of <prn id='Q83160'>Prometheus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q179543'>Iapetus</prn>, and three generations of men older than <prn id='Q1636827'>Pelasgus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q606422'>Arcas</prn> and those called at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> aboriginals. On the roof of what is called the Anactorum they say is dedicated the chariot of <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.15.1'><b>2.15.1</b> These are the things that I found most worthy of mention among the <pl id='Q1412043'>Phliasians</pl>. On the road from <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl> to <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> is a small city <pl id='Q1774167'>Cleonae</pl>. They say that <prn id='Q57911514'>Cleones</prn> was a son of <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn>, though there are some who say that <prn id='Q2754601'>Cleone</prn> was one of the daughters of <pl id='Q2866756'>Asopus</pl>, that flows by the side of <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl>. Be this as it may, one or other of these two accounts for the name of the city. Here there is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, and the image is a work of <prn id='Q19999327'>Scyllis</prn> and <prn id='Q15806048'>Dipoenus</prn>. Some hold them to have been the pupils of <prn id='Q134756'>Daedalus</prn>, but others will have it that <prn id='Q134756'>Daedalus</prn> took a wife from <pl id='Q1136193'>Gortyn</pl>, and that <prn id='Q15806048'>Dipoenus</prn> and <prn id='Q19999327'>Scyllis</prn> were his sons by this woman. <pl id='Q1774167'>Cleonae</pl> possesses this sanctuary and the tomb of <prn id='Q10715158'>Eurytus</prn> and <prn id='Q3699000'>Cteatus</prn>. The story is that as they were going as ambassadors from <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> to the <prn id='Q675181'>Isthmian contest</prn> they were here shot by <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, who charged them with being his adversaries in the war against <prn id='Q207663'>Augeas</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.15.2'><b>2.15.2</b> From <pl id='Q1774167'>Cleonae</pl> to <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> are two roads; one is direct and only for active men, the other goes along the pass called Tretus (Pierced), is narrow like the other, being surrounded by mountains, but is nevertheless more suitable for carriages. In these mountains is still shown the cave of the famous <prn id='Q140'>lion</prn>, and the place <pl id='Q748108'>Nemea</pl> is distant some fifteen stades. In <pl id='Q748108'>Nemea</pl> is a noteworthy temple of <prn id='Q107288745'>Nemean</prn> <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, but I found that the roof had fallen in and that there was no longer remaining any image. Around the temple is a grove of cypress trees, and here it is, they say, that <prn id='Q1419140'>Opheltes</prn> was placed by his <prn id='Q775296'>nurse</prn> in the grass and killed by the <prn id='Q2102'>serpent</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.15.3'><b>2.15.3</b> The <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> offer burnt sacrifices to <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> in <pl id='Q748108'>Nemea</pl> also, and elect a priest of <prn id='Q107288745'>Nemean</prn> <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>; moreover they offer a prize for a race in armour at the winter celebration of the <prn id='Q527006'>Nemean games</prn>. In this place is the grave of <prn id='Q1419140'>Opheltes</prn>; around it is a fence of stones, and within the enclosure are altars. There is also a mound of earth which is the tomb of <prn id='Q368157'>Lycurgus</prn>, the father of <prn id='Q1419140'>Opheltes</prn>. The spring they call <prn id='Q4057954'>Adrastea</prn> for some reason or other, perhaps because <prn id='Q223152'>Adrastus</prn> found it. The land was named, they say, after <prn id='Q1977078'>Nemea</prn>, who was another daughter of <pl id='Q2866756'>Asopus</pl>. Above <pl id='Q748108'>Nemea</pl> is Mount <pl id='Q25069696'>Apesas</pl>, where they say that <prn id='Q130832'>Perseus</prn> first sacrificed to <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <pl id='Q25069696'>Apesantios</pl>. </p>
<p id='2.15.4'><b>2.15.4</b> Ascending to Tretus, and again going along the road to <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>, you see on the left the ruins of <pl id='Q132564'>Mycenae</pl>. The Greeks are aware that the founder of <pl id='Q132564'>Mycenae</pl> was <prn id='Q130832'>Perseus</prn>, so I will narrate the cause of its foundation and the reason why the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> afterwards laid <pl id='Q132564'>Mycenae</pl> waste. The oldest tradition in the region now called <pl id='Q12649101'>Argolis</pl> is that when <<prn id='Q735623'>Inachus</prn> was king he named the <pl id='Q677269'>river</pl> after himself and sacrificed to <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.15.5'><b>2.15.5</b> There is also another legend which says that <prn id='Q649624'>Phoroneus</prn> was the first inhabitant of this land, and that <prn id='Q735623'>Inachus</prn>, the father of <prn id='Q649624'>Phoroneus</prn>, was not a man but the river. This river, with the rivers Cephisus and <prn id='Q4810678'>Asterion</prn>, judged concerning the land between <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> and <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn>. They decided that the land belonged to <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn>, and so <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> made their waters disappear. For this reason neither <pl id='Q677269'>Inachus</pl> nor either of the other rivers I have mentioned provides any water except after rain. In summer their streams are dry except those at <pl id='Q1236078'>Lerna</pl>. <prn id='Q649624'>Phoroneus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q735623'>Inachus</prn>, was the first to gather together the inhabitants, who up to that time had been scattered and living as isolated families. The place into which they were first gathered was named the Phoronikon Asty. </p>
<p id='2.16.1'><b>2.16.1</b> <prn id='Q649476'>Argus</prn>, the grandson of <prn id='Q649624'>Phoroneus</prn>, succeeding to the throne after <prn id='Q649624'>Phoroneus</prn>, gave his name to the land. <prn id='Q649476'>Argus</prn> begat <prn id='Q2067632'>Peirasus</prn> and <prn id='Q1085790'>Phorbas</prn>, <prn id='Q1085790'>Phorbas</prn> begat <prn id='Q2632716'>Triopas</prn>, and <prn id='Q2632716'>Triopas</prn> begat <prn id='Q1132071'>Iasus</prn> and <prn id='Q429064'>Agenor</prn>. <prn id='Q179014'>Io</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q1132071'>Iasus</prn>, went to <pl id='Q11768'>Egypt</pl>, whether the circumstances be as <prn id='Q26825'>Herodotus</prn> records or as the Greeks say. After <prn id='Q1132071'>Iasus</prn>, <prn id='Q1132777'>Crotopus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q429064'>Agenor</prn>, came to the throne and begat <prn id='Q1159894'>Sthenelas</prn>, but <prn id='Q210883'>Danaus</prn> sailed from <pl id='Q11768'>Egypt</pl> against <prn id='Q1249335'>Gelanor</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q1159894'>Sthenelas</prn>, and stayed the succession to the kingdom of the descendants of <prn id='Q429064'>Agenor</prn>. What followed is known to all alike: the crime the daughters of <prn id='Q210883'>Danaus</prn> committed against their cousins, and how, on the death of <prn id='Q210883'>Danaus</prn>, <prn id='Q7877819'>Lynceus</prn> succeeded him. </p>
<p id='2.16.2'><b>2.16.2</b> But the sons of <prn id='Q305607'>Abas</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q7877819'>Lynceus</prn>, divided the kingdom between themselves; <prn id='Q208017'>Acrisius</prn> remained where he was at <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>, and <prn id='Q644604'>Proetus</prn> took over the <pl id='Q1607754'>Heraeum</pl>, <pl id='Q502897'>Midea</pl>, <pl id='Q217379'>Tiryns</pl>, and the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl> coast region. Traces of the residence of <prn id='Q644604'>Proetus</prn> in <pl id='Q217379'>Tiryns</pl> remain to the present day. Afterwards <prn id='Q208017'>Acrisius</prn>, learning that <prn id='Q130832'>Perseus</prn> himself was not only alive but accomplishing great achievements, retired to <pl id='Q178405'>Larisa</pl> on the <pl id='Q376328'>Peneus</pl>. And <prn id='Q130832'>Perseus</prn>, wishing at all costs to see the father of his mother and to greet him with fair words and deeds, visited him at <pl id='Q178405'>Larisa</pl>. Being in the prime of life and proud of his inventing the quoit, he gave displays before all, and <prn id='Q208017'>Acrisius</prn>, as luck would have it, stepped unnoticed into the path of the quoit. </p>
<p id='2.16.3'><b>2.16.3</b> So the prediction of the god to <prn id='Q208017'>Acrisius</prn> found its fulfillment, nor was his fate prevented by his precautions against his daughter and grandson. <prn id='Q130832'>Perseus</prn>, ashamed because of the gossip about the homicide, on his return to <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> induced <prn id='Q1240153'>Megapenthes</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q644604'>Proetus</prn>, to make an exchange of kingdoms; taking over himself that of <prn id='Q1240153'>Megapenthes</prn>, he founded <pl id='Q132564'>Mycenae</pl>. For on its site the cap (myces) fell from his scabbard, and he regarded this as a sign to found a city. I have also heard the following account. He was thirsty, and the thought occurred to him to pick up a mushroom (myces) from the ground. Drinking with joy water that flowed from it, he gave to the place the name of <pl id='Q132564'>Mycenae</pl>. </p>
<p id='2.16.4'><b>2.16.4</b> <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> in the <prn id='Q35160'>Odyssey</prn> mentions a woman <prn id='Q1956583'>Mycene</prn> in the following verse: “<prn id='Q1126715'>Tyro</prn> and <prn id='Q190543'>Alcmene</prn> and the fair-crowned lady <prn id='Q1956583'>Mycene</prn>.” She is said to have been the daughter of <prn id='Q735623'>Inachus</prn> and the wife of <prn id='Q1959568'>Arestor</prn> in the poem which the Greeks call the <prn id='Q1233074'>Great Eoeae</prn>. So they say that this lady has given her name to the city. But the account which is attributed to <prn id='Q423894'>Acusilaus</prn>, that <prn id='Q6012680'>Myceneus</prn> was the son of <prn id='Q115484947'>Sparton</prn>, and Sparton of <prn id='Q649624'>Phoroneus</prn>, I cannot accept, because the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> themselves do not accept it either. For the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> have at <pl id='Q13074886'>Amyclae</pl> a portrait statue of a woman named <prn id='Q2296243'>Sparte</prn>, but they would be amazed at the mere mention of a <prn id='Q115484947'>Sparton</prn>, son of <prn id='Q649624'>Phoroneus</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.16.5'><b>2.16.5</b> It was jealousy which caused the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> to destroy <pl id='Q132564'>Mycenae</pl>. For at the time of the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl> invasion the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> made no move, but the <pl id='Q132564'>Mycenaeans</pl> sent eighty men to <pl id='Q194450'>Thermopylae</pl> who shared in the achievement of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. This eagerness for distinction brought ruin upon them by exasperating the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>. There still remain, however, parts of the city wall, including the gate, upon which stand <prn id='Q140'>lions</prn>. These, too, are said to be the work of the <prn id='Q128430'>Cyclopes</prn>, who made for <prn id='Q644604'>Proetus</prn> the wall at <pl id='Q217379'>Tiryns</pl>. </p>
<p id='2.16.6'><b>2.16.6</b> In the ruins of <pl id='Q132564'>Mycenae</pl> is a fountain called PerseaYY; there are also underground chambers of <prn id='Q192469'>Atreus</prn> and his children, in which were stored their treasures. There is the grave of <prn id='Q192469'>Atreus</prn>, along with the graves of such as returned with <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn> from <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl>, and were murdered by <prn id='Q212091'>Aegisthus</prn> after he had given them a banquet. As for the tomb of <prn id='Q170779'>Cassandra</prn>, it is claimed by the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> who dwell around <pl id='Q13074886'>Amyclae</pl>. <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn> has his tomb, and so has <prn id='Q1378505'>Eurymedon</prn> the charioteer, while another is shared by <prn id='Q3546597'>Teledamus</prn> and <prn id='Q12882487'>Pelops</prn>, twin sons, they say, of <prn id='Q170779'>Cassandra</prn>, </p>
<p id='2.16.7'><b>2.16.7</b> whom while yet babies <prn id='Q212091'>Aegisthus</prn> slew after their parents. <prn id='Q131651'>Electra</prn> has her tomb, for <prn id='Q192407'>Orestes</prn> married her to <prn id='Q494886'>Pylades</prn>. <prn id='Q504744'>Hellanicus</prn> adds that the children of <prn id='Q494886'>Pylades</prn> by <prn id='Q131651'>Electra</prn> were <prn id='Q3332707'>Medon</prn> and <prn id='Q1431607'>Strophius</prn>. <prn id='Q131157'>Clytemnestra</prn> and <prn id='Q212091'>Aegisthus</prn> were buried at some little distance from the wall. They were thought unworthy of a place within it, where lay <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn> himself and those who were murdered with him. </p>
<p id='2.17.1'><b>2.17.1</b> Fifteen stades distant from <pl id='Q132564'>Mycenae</pl> is on the left the <pl id='Q1607754'>Heraeum</pl>. Beside the road flows the brook called Eleutherion (Water of Freedom). The priestesses use it in purifications and for such sacrifices as are secret. The sanctuary itself is on a lower part of EuboeaYY. EuboeaYY is the name they give to the hill here, saying that <prn id='Q4810678'>Asterion</prn> the river had three daughters, <prn id='Q1372112'>Euboea</prn>, <prn id='Q29856413'>Prosymna</prn>, and <prn id='Q12873255'>Acraea</prn>, and that they were nurses of <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.17.2'><b>2.17.2</b> The hill opposite the <pl id='Q1607754'>Heraeum</pl> they name after <prn id='Q12873255'>Acraea</prn>, the environs of the sanctuary they name after <prn id='Q1372112'>Euboea</prn>, and the land beneath the <pl id='Q1607754'>Heraeum</pl> after <prn id='Q29856413'>Prosymna</prn>. This <pl id='Q779106'>Asterion</pl> flows above the <pl id='Q1607754'>Heraeum</pl>, and falling into a cleft disappears. On its banks grows a plant, which also is called asterion. They offer the plant itself to <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn>, and from its leaves weave her garlands. </p>
<p id='2.17.3'><b>2.17.3</b> It is said that the architect of the temple was <prn id='Q5851992'>Eupolemus</prn>, an <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl>. The sculptures carved above the pillars refer either to the birth of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> and the battle between the gods and the giants, or to the <prn id='Q42937'>Trojan War</prn> and the capture of <pl id='Q22647'>Ilium</pl>. Before the entrance stand statues of women who have been priestesses to <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> and of various heroes, including <prn id='Q192407'>Orestes</prn>. They say that <prn id='Q192407'>Orestes</prn> is the one with the inscription saying it represents the Emperor <prn id='Q1405'>Augustus</prn>. In the fore-temple are on the one side ancient statues of the <prn id='Q184353'>Graces</prn>, and on the right a couch of <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> and a votive offering, the shield which <prn id='Q171839'>Menelaus</prn> once took from <prn id='Q599489'>Euphorbus</prn> at <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl>. </p>
<p id='2.17.4'><b>2.17.4</b> The statue of <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> is seated on a throne; it is huge, made of gold and ivory, and is a work of <prn id='Q193422'>Polycleitus</prn>. She is wearing a crown with <prn id='Q184353'>Graces</prn> and <prn id='Q201411'>Seasons</prn> worked upon it, and in one hand she carries a pomegranate and in the other a sceptre. About the pomegranate I must say nothing, for its story is somewhat of a holy mystery. The presence of a cuckoo seated on the sceptre they explain by the story that when <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> was in love with <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> in her maidenhood he changed himself into this bird, and she caught it to be her pet. This tale and similar legends about the gods I relate without believing them, but I relate them nevertheless. </p>
<p id='2.17.5'><b>2.17.5</b> By the side of <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> stands what is said to be an image of <prn id='Q131125'>Hebe</prn> fashioned by <prn id='Q594770'>Naucydes</prn>; it, too, is of ivory and gold. By its side is an old image of <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> on a pillar. The oldest image is made of wild-pear wood, and was dedicated in <pl id='Q217379'>Tiryns</pl> by <prn id='Q2067632'>Peirasus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q649476'>Argus</prn>, and when the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> destroyed <pl id='Q217379'>Tiryns</pl> they carried it away to the <pl id='Q1607754'>Heraeum</pl>. I myself saw it, a small, seated image. </p>
<p id='2.17.6'><b>2.17.6</b> Of the votive offerings the following are noteworthy. There is an altar upon which is wrought in relief the fabled marriage of <prn id='Q131125'>Hebe</prn> and <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>. This is of silver, but the <prn id='Q201251'>peacock</prn> dedicated by the Emperor <prn id='Q1427'>Hadrian</prn> is of gold and gleaming stones. He dedicated it because they hold the bird to be sacred to <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn>. There lie here a golden crown and a purple robe, offerings of <prn id='Q1413'>Nero</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.17.7'><b>2.17.7</b> Above this temple are the foundations of the earlier temple and such parts of it as were spared by the flames. It was burnt down because sleep overpowered <prn id='Q611124'>Chryseis</prn>, the priestess of <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn>, when the lamp before the wreaths set fire to them. <prn id='Q611124'>Chryseis</prn> went to <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl> and supplicated <pl id='Q3983230'>Athena</pl> <prn id='Q1857789'>Alea</prn>. Although so great a disaster had befallen them the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> did not take down the statue of <prn id='Q611124'>Chryseis</prn>; it is still in position in front of the burnt temple. </p>
<p id='2.18.1'><b>2.18.1</b> By the side of the road from <pl id='Q132564'>Mycenae</pl> to <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> there is on the left hand a hero-shrine of <prn id='Q130832'>Perseus</prn>. The neighboring folk, then, pay him honors here, but the greatest honors are paid to him in <pl id='Q217214'>Seriphus</pl> and among the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, who have a precinct sacred to <prn id='Q130832'>Perseus</prn> and an altar of <prn id='Q905409'>Dictys</prn> and <prn id='Q19288071'>Clymene</prn>, who are called the saviours of <prn id='Q130832'>Perseus</prn>. Advancing a little way in the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl> territory from this hero-shrine one sees on the right the grave of <prn id='Q622504'>Thyestes</prn>. On it is a stone ram, because <prn id='Q622504'>Thyestes</prn> obtained the golden lamb after debauching his brother's wife. But <prn id='Q192469'>Atreus</prn> was not restrained by prudence from retaliating, but contrived the slaughter of the children of <prn id='Q622504'>Thyestes</prn> and the banquet of which the poets tell us. </p>
<p id='2.18.2'><b>2.18.2</b> But as to what followed, I cannot say for certain whether <prn id='Q212091'>Aegisthus</prn> began the sin or whether <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn> sinned first in murdering <prn id='Q515531'>Tantalus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q622504'>Thyestes</prn>. It is said that <prn id='Q515531'>Tantalus</prn> had received <prn id='Q131157'>Clytaemnestra</prn> in marriage from <prn id='Q192946'>Tyndareus</prn> when she was still a virgin. I myself do not wish to condemn them of having been wicked by nature; but if the pollution of <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn> and the avenging spirit of <prn id='Q615912'>Myrtilus</prn> dogged their steps so long, it was after all only consistent that the <prn id='Q220344'>Pythian priestess</prn> said to the <prn id='Q369194'>Spartiate</prn> <prn id='Q106043726'>Glaucus</prn>, the son of EpicydesYY, who consulted her about breaking his oath, that the punishment for this also comes upon the descendants of the sinner. </p>
<p id='2.18.3'><b>2.18.3</b> A little beyond the Rams — this is the name they give to the tomb of <prn id='Q622504'>Thyestes</prn> — there is on the left a place called Mysia and a sanctuary of <prn id='Q107305000'>Mysian</prn> <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>, so named from a man <prn id='Q6948683'>Mysius</prn> who, say the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>, was one of those who entertained <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>. Now this sanctuary has no roof, but in it is another temple, built of burnt brick, and wooden images of <prn id='Q45967'>Kore</prn>, <prn id='Q152262'>Plouton</prn> and <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>. Farther on is a river called <pl id='Q677269'>Inachus</pl>, and on the other side of it an altar of <prn id='Q134270'>Helius</prn> (the Sun). After this you will come to a gate named after the sanctuary near it. This sanctuary belongs to <prn id='Q94066'>Eileithyia</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.18.4'><b>2.18.4</b> The <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> are the only Greeks that I know of who have been divided into three kingdoms. For in the reign of <prn id='Q488558'>Anaxagoras</prn>, son of <prn id='Q646733'>Argeus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q1240153'>Megapenthes</prn>, the <prn id='Q11827646'>women</prn> were smitten with madness, and straying from their homes they roamed about the country, until <prn id='Q602258'>Melampus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q482134'>Amythaon</prn> cured them of the plague on condition that he himself and his brother <prn id='Q365977'>Bias</prn> had a share of the kingdom equal to that of <prn id='Q488558'>Anaxagoras</prn>. Now descended from <prn id='Q365977'>Bias</prn> five men, <prn id='Q6989963'>Neleids</prn> on their mother's side, occupied the throne for four generations down to <prn id='Q1444498'>Cyanippus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q10966726'>Aegialeus</prn>, and descended from <prn id='Q602258'>Melampus</prn> six men in six generations down to <prn id='Q474888'>Amphilochus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q330584'>Amphiaraus</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.18.5'><b>2.18.5</b> But the native house of the <prn id='Q115517923'>Anaxagoridae</prn> ruled longer than the other two. For <prn id='Q696330'>Iphis</prn>, son of <prn id='Q204857'>Alector</prn>, son of <prn id='Q488558'>Anaxagoras</prn>, left the throne to <prn id='Q1060267'>Sthenelus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q833806'>Capaneus</prn> his brother. After the capture of <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl>, <prn id='Q474888'>Amphilochus</prn> migrated to the people now called the <pl id='Q21234899'>Amphilochians</pl>, and, <prn id='Q1444498'>Cyanippus</prn> having died without issue, <prn id='Q1795033'>Cylarabes</prn>, son of <prn id='Q1060267'>Sthenelus</prn>, became sole king. However, he too left no offspring, and <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> was seized by <prn id='Q192407'>Orestes</prn>, son of <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn>, who was a neighbor. Besides his ancestral dominion, he had extended his rule over the greater part of <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl> and had succeeded to the throne of <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>; he also had a contingent of <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocian</pl> allies always ready to help him. </p>
<p id='2.18.6'><b>2.18.6</b> When <prn id='Q192407'>Orestes</prn> became king of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, they themselves consented to accept him for they considered that the sons of the daughter of <prn id='Q192946'>Tyndareus</prn> had a claim to the throne prior to that of <prn id='Q1154304'>Nicostratus</prn> and <prn id='Q1240153'>Megapenthes</prn>, who were sons of <prn id='Q171839'>Menelaus</prn> by a slave woman. On the death of <prn id='Q192407'>Orestes</prn>, there succeeded to the throne <prn id='Q2803572'>Tisamenus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q192407'>Orestes</prn> and of <prn id='Q658523'>Hermione</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q171839'>Menelaus</prn>. The mother of <prn id='Q1336476'>Penthilus</prn>, the bastard son of <prn id='Q192407'>Orestes</prn>, was, according to the poet <prn id='Q726952'>Cinaethon</prn>, <prn id='Q1353815'>Erigone</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q212091'>Aegisthus</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.18.7'><b>2.18.7</b> It was in the reign of this <prn id='Q2803572'>Tisamenus</prn> that the <prn id='Q828084'>Heracleidae</prn> returned to the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl>; they were <prn id='Q636796'>Temenus</prn> and <prn id='Q1788026'>Cresphontes</prn>, the sons of <prn id='Q311536'>Aristomachus</prn>, together with the sons of the third brother, <prn id='Q666525'>Aristodemus</prn>, who had died. Their claim to <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> and to the throne of <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> was, in my opinion, most just, because <prn id='Q2803572'>Tisamenus</prn> was a <prn id='Q12883341'>Pelopid</prn>, but the <prn id='Q828084'>Heracleidae</prn> were <prn id='Q12372321'>descendants of Perseus</prn>. <prn id='Q192946'>Tyndareus</prn> himself, they made out, had been expelled by <prn id='Q342279'>Hippocoon</prn>, and they said that <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, having killed <prn id='Q342279'>Hippocoon</prn> and his sons, had given the land in trust to <prn id='Q192946'>Tyndareus</prn>. They gave the same kind of account about <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl> also, that it had been given in trust to <prn id='Q193267'>Nestor</prn> by <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> after he had taken <pl id='Q2047396'>Pylus</pl>. </p>
<p id='2.18.8'><b>2.18.8</b> So they expelled <prn id='Q2803572'>Tisamenus</prn> from <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl> and <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>, and the descendants of <prn id='Q193267'>Nestor</prn> from <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl>, namely <prn id='Q1337820'>Alcmaeon</prn>, son of <prn id='Q3483917'>Sillus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q956906'>Thrasymedes</prn>, <prn id='Q15987308'>Peisistratus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q1766777'>Peisistratus</prn>, and the sons of <prn id='Q7124088'>Paeon</prn>, son of <prn id='Q577552'>Antilochus</prn>, and with them <prn id='Q1255043'>Melanthus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q3564602'>Andropompus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q894065'>Borus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q2069420'>Penthilus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q3899862'>Periclymenus</prn>. So <prn id='Q2803572'>Tisamenus</prn> and his sons went with his army to the land that is now <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaia</pl>. </p>
<p id='2.18.9'><b>2.18.9</b> To what people <prn id='Q15987308'>Peisistratus</prn> retreated I do not know, but the rest of the <prn id='Q6989963'>Neleidae</prn> went to <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, and the clans of the <pl id='Q13465171'>Paeonidae</pl> and of the <prn id='Q652086'>Alcmaeonidae</prn> were named after them. <prn id='Q1255043'>Melanthus</prn> even came to the throne, having deposed <prn id='Q938228'>Thymoetes</prn> the son of <prn id='Q1144291'>Oxyntes</prn>; for <prn id='Q938228'>Thymoetes</prn> was the last <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> king descended from <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.19.1'><b>2.19.1</b> It is not to my purpose that I should set forth here the history of <prn id='Q1788026'>Cresphontes</prn> and of the sons of <prn id='Q666525'>Aristodemus</prn>. But <prn id='Q636796'>Temenus</prn> openly employed, instead of his sons, <prn id='Q912772'>Delphontes</prn>, son of <prn id='Q17516371'>Antimachus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q17516397'>Thrasyanor</prn>, son of <prn id='Q16190194'>Ctesippus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, as general in war and as adviser on all occasions. Even before this he had made him his son-in-law, while <prn id='Q830706'>Hyrnetho</prn> was his favorite daughter; he was accordingly suspected of intending to divert the throne to her and <prn id='Q912772'>Delphontes</prn>. For this reason his sons plotted against him, and <prn id='Q1738025'>Ceisus</prn>, the eldest of them, seized the kingdom. </p>
<p id='2.19.2'><b>2.19.2</b> But from the earliest times the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> have loved freedom and self-government, and they limited to the utmost the authority of their kings, so that to <prn id='Q60774'>Medon</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q1738025'>Ceisus</prn>, and to his descendants was left a kingdom that was such only in name. <prn id='Q1919738'>Meltas</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q611509'>Lacedas</prn>, the tenth descendant of <prn id='Q60774'>Medon</prn>, was condemned by the people and deposed altogether from the kingship. </p>
<p id='2.19.3'><b>2.19.3</b> The most famous building in the city of <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> is the sanctuary of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> <prn id='Q107349791'>Lycius</prn> (Wolf-god). The modern image was made by the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> <prn id='Q11955767'>Attalus</prn>, but the original temple and <prn id='Q693222'>xoanon</prn> (wooden image) were the offering of <prn id='Q210883'>Danaus</prn>. I am of opinion that in those days all images, especially <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptian</pl> images, were made of wood. The reason why <prn id='Q210883'>Danaus</prn> founded a sanctuary of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> <prn id='Q107349791'>Lycius</prn> was this. On coming to <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> he claimed the kingdom against <prn id='Q1249335'>Gelanor</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q1159894'>Sthenelas</prn>. Many plausible arguments were brought forward by both parties, and those of <prn id='Q1159894'>Sthenelas</prn> were considered as fair as those of his opponent; so the people, who were sitting in judgment, put off, they say, the decision to the following day. </p>
<p id='2.19.4'><b>2.19.4</b> At dawn a <prn id='Q18498'>wolf</prn> fell upon a herd of <prn id='Q473194'>oxen</prn> that was pasturing before the wall, and attacked and fought with the <prn id='Q693690'>bull</prn> that was the leader of the herd. It occurred to the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> that <prn id='Q1249335'>Gelanor</prn> was like the <prn id='Q693690'>bull</prn> and <prn id='Q210883'>Danaus</prn> like the <prn id='Q18498'>wolf</prn>, for as the <prn id='Q18498'>wolf</prn> will not live with men, so <prn id='Q210883'>Danaus</prn> up to that time had not lived with them. It was because the <prn id='Q18498'>wolf</prn> overcame the <prn id='Q693690'>bull</prn> that <prn id='Q210883'>Danaus</prn> won the kingdom. Accordingly, believing that <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> had brought the <prn id='Q18498'>wolf</prn> on the herd, he founded a sanctuary of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> <prn id='Q107349791'>Lycius</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.19.5'><b>2.19.5</b> Here is dedicated the throne of <prn id='Q210883'>Danaus</prn>, and here is placed a statue of <prn id='Q29789169'>Biton</prn>, in the form of a man carrying a <prn id='Q693690'>bull</prn> on his shoulders. According to the poet <prn id='Q107287649'>Lyceas</prn>, when the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> were holding a sacrifice to <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> at <pl id='Q748108'>Nemea</pl>, <prn id='Q29789169'>Biton</prn> by sheer physical strength took up a <prn id='Q693690'>bull</prn> and carried it there. Next to this statue is a fire which they keep burning, calling it the fire of <prn id='Q649624'>Phoroneus</prn>. For they do not admit that fire was given to mankind by <prn id='Q83160'>Prometheus</prn>, but insist in assigning the discovery of fire to <prn id='Q649624'>Phoroneus</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.19.6'><b>2.19.6</b> As to the wooden images of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> and <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn>, the one they say was made by <prn id='Q278930'>Epeus</prn>, while the other is a votive offering of <prn id='Q472784'>Hypermestra</prn>. She was the only one of the daughters of <prn id='Q210883'>Danaus</prn> who neglected his command, and was accordingly brought to justice by him, because be considered that his life was in danger so long as <prn id='Q7877819'>Lynceus</prn> was at large, and that the refusal to share in the crime of her sisters increased the disgrace of the contriver of the deed. On her trial she was acquitted by the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>, and to commemorate her escape she dedicated an image of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> Nikephoros (bringer of victory). </p>
<p id='2.19.7'><b>2.19.7</b> Within the temple is a statue of <prn id='Q19720603'>Ladas</prn>, the swiftest runner of his time, and one of <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> with a tortoise which he has caught to make a lyre. Before the temple is a pit with a relief representing a fight between a <prn id='Q693690'>bull</prn> and a <prn id='Q18498'>wolf</prn>, and with them a maiden throwing a rock at the <prn id='Q693690'>bull</prn>. The maiden is thought to be <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>. <prn id='Q210883'>Danaus</prn> dedicated these, and some pillars hard by and wooden images of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> and <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.19.8'><b>2.19.8</b> Here are graves; one is that of <prn id='Q3833059'>Linus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> by <prn id='Q129168'>Psamathe</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q1132777'>Crotopus</prn>; the other, they say, is that of <prn id='Q3833059'>Linus</prn> the poet. The story of the latter <prn id='Q3833059'>Linus</prn> is more appropriate to another part of my narrative, and so I omit it here, while I have already given the history of the son of <prn id='Q129168'>Psamathe</prn> in my account of <pl id='Q42307600'>Megara</pl>. After these is an image of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> <prn id='Q3848037'>Agyieus</prn> (of streets), and an altar of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q107246891'>Hyetios</prn> (of Rain), where those who were helping <prn id='Q334817'>Polyneices</prn> in his efforts to be restored to <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> swore an oath together that they would either capture <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> or die. As to the tomb of <prn id='Q83160'>Prometheus</prn>, their account seems to me to be less probable than that of the <pl id='Q3354839'>Opuntians</pl>, but they hold to it nevertheless. </p>
<p id='2.20.1'><b>2.20.1</b> Passing over a statue of <prn id='Q16096278'>Creugas</prn>, a boxer, and a trophy that was set up to celebrate a victory over the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthians</pl>, you come to a seated image of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q1637673'>Meilichius</prn> (Gracious), made of white marble by <prn id='Q193422'>Polycleitus</prn>. I discovered that it was made for the following reason. Ever since the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> began to make war upon the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> there was no cessation of hostilities until <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q313907'>Amyntas</prn>, forced them to stay within the original boundaries of their territories. Before this, if the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> were not engaged on some business outside the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl>, they were always trying to annex a piece of <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl> territory; or if they were busied with a war beyond their borders it was the turn of the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> to retaliate. </p>
<p id='2.20.2'><b>2.20.2</b> When the hatred of both sides was at its height, the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> resolved to maintain a thousand picked men. The commander appointed over them was the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl> <prn id='Q122452589'>Bryas</prn>. His general behavior to the men of the people was violent, and a maiden who was being taken to the bridegroom he seized from those who were escorting her and ravished. When night came on, the girl waited until he was asleep and put out his eyes. Detected in the morning, she took refuge as a suppliant with the people. When they did not give her up to the Thousand for punishment both sides took up arms; the people won the day, and in their anger left none of their opponents alive. Subsequently they had recourse to purifications for shedding kindred blood; among other things they dedicated an image of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q1637673'>Meilichius</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.20.3'><b>2.20.3</b> Hard by are <prn id='Q64581998'>Cleobis</prn> and <prn id='Q29789169'>Biton</prn> carved in relief on stone, themselves drawing the carriage and taking in it their mother to the <pl id='Q1607754'>sanctuary</pl> of <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn>. Opposite them is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q107288745'>Nemean</prn> <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, and an upright bronze statue of the god made by <prn id='Q192222'>Lysippus</prn>. Going forward from this you see on the right the grave of <prn id='Q649624'>Phoroneus</prn>, to whom even in our time they bring offerings as to a hero. Over against the <prn id='Q107288745'>Nemean</prn> <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> is a temple of <prn id='Q213440'>Fortune</prn>, which must be very old if it be the one in which <prn id='Q252387'>Palamedes</prn> dedicated the dice that he had invented. </p>
<p id='2.20.4'><b>2.20.4</b> The tomb near this they call that of the maenad <prn id='Q115706159'>Chorea</prn>, saying that she was one of the women who joined <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> in his expedition against <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>, and that <prn id='Q130832'>Perseus</prn>, being victorious in the battle, put most of the women to the sword. To the rest they gave a common grave, but to <prn id='Q115706159'>Chorea</prn> they gave burial apart because of her high rank. </p>
<p id='2.20.5'><b>2.20.5</b> A little farther on is a sanctuary of the <prn id='Q201411'>Seasons</prn>. On coming back from here you see statues of <prn id='Q334817'>Polyneices</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q130890'>Oedipus</prn>, and of all the chieftains who with him were killed in battle at the wall of <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>. These men <prn id='Q40939'>Aeschylus</prn> has reduced to the number of <prn id='Q3119061'>Seven</prn> only, although there were more chiefs than this in the expedition, from <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>, from <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl>, with some even from <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl>. But the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> have adopted the number seven from the drama of <prn id='Q40939'>Aeschylus</prn>, and near to their statues are the statues of those who took <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>: <prn id='Q10966726'>Aegialeus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q223152'>Adrastus</prn>; <prn id='Q519168'>Promachus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q1128942'>Parthenopaeus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q668054'>Talaus</prn>; <prn id='Q2102808'>Polydorus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q976463'>Hippomedon</prn>; <prn id='Q1289213'>Thersander</prn>; <prn id='Q591089'>Alcmaeon</prn> and <prn id='Q474888'>Amphilochus</prn>, the sons of <prn id='Q330584'>Amphiaraus</prn>; <prn id='Q208256'>Diomedes</prn>, and <prn id='Q1060267'>Sthenelus</prn>. Among their company were also <prn id='Q1378407'>Euryalus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q1968413'>Mecisteus</prn>, and <prn id='Q21547914'>Adrastus</prn> and <prn id='Q106779384'>Timeas</prn>, sons of <prn id='Q334817'>Polyneices</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.20.6'><b>2.20.6</b> Not far from the statues are shown the tomb of <prn id='Q210883'>Danaus</prn> and a cenotaph of the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> who met their death at <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl> or on the journey home. Here there is also a sanctuary of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> the <prn id='Q2303797'>Saviour</prn>. Beyond it is a building where the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl> women bewail <prn id='Q163920'>Adonis</prn>. On the right of the entrance is the sanctuary of <prn id='Q115829088'>Cephisus</prn>. It is said that the water of this river was not utterly destroyed by <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, but that just in this place, where the sanctuary is, it can be heard flowing under the earth. </p>
<p id='2.20.7'><b>2.20.7</b> Beside the sanctuary of <prn id='Q115829088'>Cephisus</prn> is a head of <prn id='Q160730'>Medusa</prn> made of stone, which is said to be another of the works of the <prn id='Q128430'>Cyclopes</prn>. The ground behind it is called even at the present time the <pl id='Q52988430'>Kriterion</pl> (place of judgment), because it was here that they say <prn id='Q472784'>Hypermestra</prn> was brought to judgment by <prn id='Q210883'>Danaus</prn>. Not far from this is a <pl id='Q24912661'>theater</pl>. In it are some noteworthy sights, including a representation of a man killing another, namely the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl> <prn id='Q106778834'>Perilaus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q40889183'>Alcenor</prn>, killing the <pl id='Q5690'>Spartiate</pl> <prn id='Q3357641'>Othryadas</prn>. Before this, <prn id='Q106778834'>Perilaus</prn> had succeeded in winning the prize for wrestling at the <prn id='Q527006'>Nemean games</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.20.8'><b>2.20.8</b> Beyond the <pl id='Q24912661'>theater</pl> is a <prn id='Q111427783'>sanctuary</prn> of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>, and before the hedos (sacred image) is a slab with a representation wrought on it in relief of <prn id='Q287216'>Telesilla</prn>, the lyric poetess. Her books lie scattered at her feet, and she herself holds in her hand an helmet, which she is looking at and is about to place on her head. <prn id='Q287216'>Telesilla</prn> was a distinguished woman who was especially renowned for her poetry. It happened that the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> had suffered an awful <prn id='Q720100'>defeat</prn> at the hands of <prn id='Q44005'>Cleomenes</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q349897'>Anaxandrides</prn>, and the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. Some fell in the actual fighting; others, who had fled to the <prn id='Q106350076'>grove of Argus</prn>, also perished. At first they left sanctuary under an agreement, which was treacherously broken, and the survivors, when they realized this, were burnt to death in the grove. So when <prn id='Q44005'>Cleomenes</prn> led his troops to <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> there were no men to defend it. </p>
<p id='2.20.9'><b>2.20.9</b> But <prn id='Q287216'>Telesilla</prn> mounted on the wall all the slaves and such as were incapable of bearing arms through youth or old age, and she herself, collecting the arms in the sanctuaries and those that were left in the houses, armed the women of vigorous age, and then posted them where she knew the enemy would attack. When the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> came on, the women were not dismayed at their battle-cry, but stood their ground and fought valiantly. Then the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, realizing that to destroy the women would be an invidious success while defeat would mean a shameful disaster, gave way before the women. </p>
<p id='2.20.10'><b>2.20.10</b> This fight had been foretold by the <prn id='Q220344'>Pythian priestess</prn> in the oracle quoted by <prn id='Q26825'>Herodotus</prn>, who perhaps understood to what it referred and perhaps did not: “But when the time shall come that the female conquers in battle, Driving away the male, and wins great glory in <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>, Many an <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl> woman will tear both cheeks in her sorrow.” Such are the words of the oracle referring to the exploit of the women. </p>
<p id='2.21.1'><b>2.21.1</b> Having descended thence, and having turned again to the agora, we come to the tomb of <prn id='Q5064045'>Cerdo</prn>, the wife of <prn id='Q649624'>Phoroneus</prn>, and to a temple of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>. The sanctuary of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, surnamed <prn id='Q611171'>Persuasion</prn>, is another offering of <prn id='Q472784'>Hypermestra</prn> after winning the trial to which she was brought by her father because of <prn id='Q7877819'>Lynceus</prn>. Here there is also a bronze statue of <prn id='Q82732'>Aeneas</prn>, and a place called Delta. I intentionally do not discuss the origin of the name, because I could not accept the traditional accounts. </p>
<p id='2.21.2'><b>2.21.2</b> In front of it stands an altar of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q106522413'>Phyxius</prn> (God of Flight), and near is the tomb of <prn id='Q1641030'>Hypermestra</prn>, the mother of <prn id='Q330584'>Amphiaraus</prn>, the other tomb being that of <prn id='Q472784'>Hypermestra</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q210883'>Danaus</prn>, with whom is also buried <prn id='Q7877819'>Lynceus</prn>. Opposite these is the grave of <prn id='Q668054'>Talaus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q365977'>Bias</prn>; the history of <prn id='Q365977'>Bias</prn> and his descendants I have already given. </p>
<p id='2.21.3'><b>2.21.3</b> A sanctuary of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> <prn id='Q107349773'>Salpinx</prn> (trumpet) they say was founded by <prn id='Q106779439'>Hegeleos</prn>. This <prn id='Q106779439'>Hegeleos</prn>, according to the story, was the son of <prn id='Q12760076'>Tyrsenus</prn>, and <prn id='Q12760076'>Tyrsenus</prn> was the son of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> and the <pl id='Q620765'>Lydian</pl> woman; <prn id='Q12760076'>Tyrsenus</prn> invented the trumpet, and <prn id='Q106779439'>Hegeleos</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q12760076'>Tyrsenus</prn>, taught the <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn> with <prn id='Q636796'>Temenus</prn> how to play the instrument, and for this reason gave <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> the surname <prn id='Q107349773'>Salpinx</prn>. Before the temple of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> is, they say, the grave of <prn id='Q319406'>Epimenides</prn>. The <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl> story is that the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> made war upon the <pl id='Q173527'>Cnossians</pl> and took <prn id='Q319406'>Epimenides</prn> alive; they then put him to death for not prophesying good luck to them, and the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> taking his body buried it here. </p>
<p id='2.21.4'><b>2.21.4</b> The building of white marble in just about the middle of the marketplace is not, as the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> declare, a trophy in honor of a victory over <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn> of <pl id='Q565751'>Epeirus</pl>, but it can be shown that his body was burnt here, and that this is his monument, on which are carved in relief the elephants and his other instruments of warfare. This building then was set up where the pyre stood, but the bones of <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn> lie in the sanctuary of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>, beside which, as I have shown in my account of <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl>, his death occurred. At the entrance to this sanctuary of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> you can see a bronze shield of <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn> hanging dedicated over the door. </p>
<p id='2.21.5'><b>2.21.5</b> Not far from the building in the agora of <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> is a mound of earth, in which they say lies the head of the <prn id='Q160730'>Gorgon</prn> <prn id='Q160730'>Medusa</prn>. I omit the miraculous, but give the rational parts of the story about her. After the death of her father, <prn id='Q200382'>Phorcus</prn>, she reigned over those living around Lake Tritonis, going out hunting and leading the <pl id='Q2370577'>Libyans</pl> to battle. On one such occasion, when she was encamped with an army over against the forces of <prn id='Q130832'>Perseus</prn>, who was followed by picked troops from the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl>, she was assassinated by night. <prn id='Q130832'>Perseus</prn>, admiring her beauty even in death, cut off her head and carried it to show the Greeks. </p>
<p id='2.21.6'><b>2.21.6</b> But <prn id='Q106780297'>Procles</prn>, the son of EucratesYY, a <pl id='Q6343'>Carthaginian</pl>, thought a different account more plausible than the preceding. It is as follows. Among the incredible monsters to be found in the Libyan desert are wild men and wild women. <prn id='Q106780297'>Procles</prn> affirmed that he had seen a man from them who had been brought to <pl id='Q18287233'>Rome</pl>. So he guessed that a woman wandered from them, reached Lake Tritonis, and harried the neighbours until <prn id='Q130832'>Perseus</prn> killed her; <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> was supposed to have helped him in this exploit, because the people who live around Lake Tritonis are sacred to her. </p>
<p id='2.21.7'><b>2.21.7</b> In <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>, by the side of this monument of the <prn id='Q102059'>Gorgon</prn>, is the grave of <prn id='Q950523'>Gorgophone</prn> (Gorgon-killer), the daughter of <prn id='Q130832'>Perseus</prn>. As soon as you hear the name you can understand the reason why it was given her. On the death of her husband, <prn id='Q342343'>Perieres</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q406388'>Aeolus</prn>, whom she married when a virgin, she married <prn id='Q1162217'>Oebalus</prn>, being the first woman, they say, to marry a second time; for before this wives were wont, on the death of their husbands, to live as widows. </p>
<p id='2.21.8'><b>2.21.8</b> In front of the grave is a trophy of stone made to commemorate a victory over an <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl> <prn id='Q106780942'>Laphaes</prn>. When this man was tyrant I write what the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> themselves say concerning themselves — the people rose up against him and cast him out. He fled to <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>, and the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> tried to restore him to power, but were defeated by the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>, who killed the greater part of them and <prn id='Q106780942'>Laphaes</prn> as well. Not far from the trophy is the sanctuary of <prn id='Q103107'>Leto</prn>; the image is a work of <prn id='Q105290'>Praxiteles</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.21.9'><b>2.21.9</b> The statue of the maiden beside the goddess they call <prn id='Q1539124'>Chloris</prn> (Pale), saying that she was a daughter of <prn id='Q213621'>Niobe</prn>, and that she was called <prn id='Q1539124'>Meliboea</prn> at the first. When the children of <prn id='Q242835'>Amphion</prn> were destroyed by <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> and <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, she alone of her sisters, along with <prn id='Q482039'>Amyclas</prn>, escaped; their escape was due to their prayers to <prn id='Q103107'>Leto</prn>. Meliboea was struck so pale by her fright, not only at the time but also for the rest of her life, that even her name was accordingly changed from Meliboea to <prn id='Q1539124'>Chloris</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.21.10'><b>2.21.10</b> Now the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> say that these two built originally the temple to <prn id='Q103107'>Leto</prn>, but I think that none of <prn id='Q213621'>Niobe</prn>'s children survived, for I place more reliance than others on the poetry of <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>, one of whose verses bears out my view: <br>“Though they were only two, yet they gave all to destruction.” So <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> knows that the house of <prn id='Q242835'>Amphion</prn> was utterly overthrown. </p>
<p id='2.22.1'><b>2.22.1</b> The temple of <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> <prn id='Q21548690'>Anthea</prn> (Flowery) is on the right of the sanctuary of <prn id='Q103107'>Leto</prn>, and before it is a grave of women. They were killed in a battle against the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> under <prn id='Q130832'>Perseus</prn>, having come from the <pl id='Q34575'>Aegean</pl> islands to help <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> in war; for which reason they are surnamed <prn id='Q107287439'>Haliae</prn> (women of the sea). Facing the tomb of the women is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>, surnamed <pl id='Q14472556'>Pelasgian</pl> from <prn id='Q6070881'>Pelasgus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q2632716'>Triopas</prn>, its founder, and not far from the sanctuary is the grave of <prn id='Q6070881'>Pelasgus</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.22.2'><b>2.22.2</b> Opposite the grave is a small bronze vessel supporting ancient images of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, and <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>. Now <prn id='Q107287649'>Lyceas</prn> in his poem says that the image is of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q107287594'>Mechaneus</prn> (Contriver), and that here the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> who set out against <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl> swore to hold out in the war until they either took <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl> or met their end fighting.

<p id='2.22.3'><b>2.22.3</b> Now that the <prn id='Q515531'>Tantalus</prn> is buried here who was the son of <prn id='Q622504'>Thyestes</prn> or <prn id='Q850078'>Broteas</prn> (both accounts are given) and married <prn id='Q131157'>Clytaemnestra</prn> before <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn> did, I will not gainsay; but the grave of him [<prn id='Q182101'>Tantalus</prn> who legend says was son of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> and <prn id='Q152262'>Plouton</prn> — it is worth seeing — is on Mount <pl id='Q532698'>Sipylus</pl>. I know because I saw it. Moreover, no constraint came upon him to flee from <pl id='Q532698'>Sipylus</pl>, such as afterwards forced <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn> to run away when <prn id='Q1495743'>Ilus</prn> the <pl id='Q32579'>Phrygian</pl> launched an army against him. But I must pursue the inquiry no further. The ritual performed at the pit hard by they say was instituted by <prn id='Q1154304'>Nicostratus</prn>, a native. Even at the present day they throw into the pit burning torches in honor of <prn id='Q45967'>Kore</prn> who is daughter of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.22.4'><b>2.22.4</b> Here is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, surnamed <prn id='Q107344119'>Prosclystius</prn> (Flooder), for they say that <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> inundated the greater part of the country because <prn id='Q735623'>Inachus</prn> and his assessors decided that the land belonged to <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> and not to him. Now it was <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> who induced <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> to send the sea back, but the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> made a sanctuary to <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> <prn id='Q107344119'>Prosclystius</prn> at the spot where the tide ebbed. </p>
<p id='2.22.5'><b>2.22.5</b> Going on a little further you see the grave of <prn id='Q649476'>Argus</prn>, reputed to be the son of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> and <prn id='Q213621'>Niobe</prn>, daughter of <prn id='Q649624'>Phoroneus</prn>. After these comes a temple of the <prn id='Q190103'>Dioscuri</prn>.

<p id='2.22.6'><b>2.22.6</b> Near the Lords is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q94066'>Eilethyia</prn>, dedicated by <prn id='Q164061'>Helen</prn> when, <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> having gone away with <prn id='Q502156'>Peirithous</prn> to <pl id='Q2551754'>Thesprotia</pl>, <pl id='Q618453'>Aphidna</pl> had been captured by the <prn id='Q190103'>Dioscuri</prn> and <prn id='Q164061'>Helen</prn> was being brought to <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl>. For it is said that she was with child, was delivered in <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>, and founded there the sanctuary of <prn id='Q94066'>Eilethyia</prn>, giving the daughter she bore to <prn id='Q131157'>Clytaemnestra</prn>, who was already wedded to <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn>, while she herself subsequently married <prn id='Q171839'>Menelaus</prn>. </p>

Over against the sanctuary of <prn id='Q94066'>Eilethyia</prn> is a temple of <prn id='Q131575'>Hecate</prn>, and the image is a work of <prn id='Q309579'>Scopas</prn>. This one is of stone, while the bronze images opposite, also of <prn id='Q131575'>Hecate</prn>, were made respectively by <prn id='Q193422'>Polycleitus</prn> and his brother <prn id='Q594770'>Naucydes</prn>, son of Mothon. </p>
<p id='2.22.8'><b>2.22.8</b> As you go along a straight road to a gymnasium, called <prn id='Q1795033'>Cylarabis</prn> after the son of <prn id='Q1060267'>Sthenelus</prn>, you come to the grave of <prn id='Q2335647'>Licymnius</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q26296'>Electryon</prn>, who, <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> says, was killed by <prn id='Q690613'>Tleptolemus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> for which homicide <prn id='Q690613'>Tleptolemus</prn> was banished from <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>. On turning a little aside from the road to <prn id='Q1795033'>Cylarabis</prn> and to the gate there, you come to the tomb of <prn id='Q3944390'>Sacadas</prn>, who was the first to play at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> the <pl id='Q682558'>Pythian</pl> flute-tune; </p>
<p id='2.22.9'><b>2.22.9</b> the hostility of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> to flute-players, which had lasted ever since the rivalry of <prn id='Q599737'>Marsyas</prn> the <prn id='Q464091'>Silenus</prn>, is supposed to have stayed because of this <prn id='Q3944390'>Sacadas</prn>. In the gymnasium of <prn id='Q1795033'>Cylarabes</prn> is an <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> called <prn id='Q107289244'>Pania</prn>; they show also the graves of <prn id='Q1060267'>Sthenelus</prn> and of <prn id='Q1795033'>Cylarabes</prn> himself. Not far from the gymnasium has been built a common grave of those <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> who sailed with the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> to enslave <pl id='Q4420718'>Syracuse</pl> and <pl id='Q4951156'>Sicily</pl>. </p>
<p id='2.23.1'><b>2.23.1</b> As you go from here along a road called Hollow there is on the right a temple of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>; the image, they say, is from <pl id='Q173096'>Euboea</pl>. For when the Greeks, as they were returning from <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl>, met with the shipwreck at <pl id='Q1982478'>Caphereus</pl>, those of the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> who were able to escape to land suffered from cold and hunger. Having prayed that someone of the gods should prove himself a saviour in their present distress, straightway as they advanced they came upon a cave of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>; in the cave was an image of the god, and on this occasion wild she-<prn id='Q2934'>goats</prn> had gathered there to escape from the storm. These the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> killed, using the flesh as food and the skins as raiment. When the storm was over and the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>, having refitted their ships, were returning home, they took with them the wooden image from the cave, and continue to honor it to the present day. </p>
<p id='2.23.2'><b>2.23.2</b> Very near to the temple of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> you will see the house of <prn id='Q223152'>Adrastus</prn>, farther on a sanctuary of <prn id='Q330584'>Amphiaraus</prn>, and opposite the sanctuary the tomb of <prn id='Q1125040'>Eriphyle</prn>. Next to these is a precinct of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>, and after them a sanctuary of <prn id='Q3636218'>Baton</prn>. Now <prn id='Q3636218'>Baton</prn> belonged to the same family as <prn id='Q330584'>Amphiaraus</prn>, to the Melampodidae, and served as his charioteer when he went forth to battle. When the rout took place at the wall of <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>, the earth opened and received <prn id='Q330584'>Amphiaraus</prn> and his chariot, swallowing up this <prn id='Q3636218'>Baton</prn> at the same time. </p>
<p id='2.23.3'><b>2.23.3</b> Returning from Hollow Street, you see what they say is the grave of <prn id='Q830706'>Hyrnetho</prn>. If they allow that it is merely a cenotaph erected to the memory of the lady, their account is likely enough but if they believe that the corpse lies here I cannot credit it, and leave anyone to do so who has not learnt the history of <pl id='Q233576'>Epidaurus</pl>. </p>
<p id='2.23.4'><b>2.23.4</b> The most famous sanctuary of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> at <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> contains at the present day a white-marble image of the god seated, and by his side stands <prn id='Q202257'>Health</prn>. There are also seated figures of <prn id='Q106778695'>Xenophilus</prn> and <prn id='Q11921061'>Straton</prn>, who made the images. The original founder of the sanctuary was <prn id='Q106778666'>Sphyrus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q674319'>Machaon</prn> and brother of the <prn id='Q1408128'>Alexanor</prn> who is honored among the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl> in <pl id='Q59637009'>Titane</pl>. </p>
<p id='2.23.5'><b>2.23.5</b> The <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>, like the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> and <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl>, worship <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> <prn id='Q107289283'>Pheraea</prn>, and they, too, assert that the image of the goddess was brought from <pl id='Q1330631'>Pherae</pl> in <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessaly</pl>. But I cannot agree with them when they say that in <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> are the tombs of <prn id='Q272000'>Deianeira</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q749966'>Oeneus</prn>, and of <prn id='Q729332'>Helenus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q170473'>Priam</prn>, and that there is among them the image of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> that was brought from <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl>, thus causing the capture of that city. For the <prn id='Q829650'>Palladium</prn>, as it is called, was manifestly brought to <pl id='Q913582'>Italy</pl> by <prn id='Q82732'>Aeneas</prn>. As to <prn id='Q272000'>Deianeira</prn>, we know that her death took place near <pl id='Q1231448'>Trachis</pl> and not in <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>, and her grave is near <pl id='Q1231448'>Heraclea</pl>, at the foot of Mount <pl id='Q132378'>Oeta</pl>. </p>
<p id='2.23.6'><b>2.23.6</b> The story of <prn id='Q729332'>Helenus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q170473'>Priam</prn>, I have already given: that he went to <pl id='Q565751'>Epeirus</pl> with <prn id='Q322639'>Pyrrhus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn>; that, wedded to <prn id='Q19376'>Andromache</prn>, he was guardian to the children of <prn id='Q322639'>Pyrrhus</prn> and that the district called <prn id='Q21645767'>Cestrine</prn> received its name from <prn id='Q1045153'>Cestrinus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q729332'>Helenus</prn>. Now even the guides of the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> themselves are aware that their account is not entirely correct. Nevertheless they hold to their opinion, for it is not easy to make the multitude change their views. The <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> have other things worth seeing; </p>
<p id='2.23.7'><b>2.23.7</b> for instance, an underground building over which was the bronze chamber which <prn id='Q208017'>Acrisius</prn> once made to guard his daughter. <prn id='Q106778952'>Perilaus</prn>, however, when he became tyrant, pulled it down. Besides this building there is the tomb of <prn id='Q1132777'>Crotopus</prn> and a temple of <prn id='Q58842393'>Cresian</prn> <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>. For they say that the god, having made war on <prn id='Q130832'>Perseus</prn>, afterwards laid aside his enmity, and received great honors at the hands of the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>, including this precinct set specially apart for himself. </p>
<p id='2.23.8'><b>2.23.8</b> It was afterwards called the precinct of the <pl id='Q4752820'>Cretan</pl> god, because, when <prn id='Q184874'>Ariadne</prn> died, <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> buried her here. But <prn id='Q107287649'>Lyceas</prn> says that when the temple was being rebuilt an earthenware coffin was found, and that it was <prn id='Q184874'>Ariadne</prn>'s. He also said that both he himself and other <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> had seen it. Near the temple of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> is a temple of <prn id='Q35500'>Heavenly Aphrodite</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.24.1'><b>2.24.1</b> The acropolis they call <pl id='Q1012861'>Larisa</pl>, after the <prn id='Q86723568'>daughter</prn> of <prn id='Q6070881'>Pelasgus</prn>. After her were also named two of the <pl id='Q178405'>cities</pl> in <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessaly</pl>, the <pl id='Q11931175'>one by the sea</pl> and the one on the <pl id='Q376328'>Peneus</pl>. As you go up the acropolis you come to the sanctuary of <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> <prn id='Q420733'>Akraia</prn> (of the Height), and also a <pl id='Q38281150'>temple</pl> of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, which is said to have been first built by <prn id='Q109802111'>Pythaeus</prn> when he came from <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>. The present image is a bronze standing figure called <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> <prn id='Q60173934'>Deiradiotes</prn>, because this place, too, is called Deirai (Ridge). Oracular responses are still given here, and the oracle acts in the following way. There is a woman who prophesies, being debarred from intercourse with a man. Every month a lamb is sacrificed at night, and the woman, after tasting the blood, becomes inspired by the god. </p>
<p id='2.24.2'><b>2.24.2</b> Adjoining the <pl id='Q38281150'>temple</pl> of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> <prn id='Q60173934'>Deiradiotes</prn> is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> <prn id='Q107349774'>Oxyderces</prn> (Sharp-sighted), dedicated by <prn id='Q208256'>Diomedes</prn>, because once when he was fighting at <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl> the goddess removed the mist from his eyes. Adjoining it is the race-course, in which they hold the games in honor of <prn id='Q107288745'>Nemean</prn> <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> and the festival of <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn>. As you go to the acropolis there is on the left of the road another tomb of the children of <prn id='Q404844'>Egyptus</prn>. For here are the heads apart from the bodies, which are at <pl id='Q1236078'>Lerna</pl>. For it was at <pl id='Q1236078'>Lerna</pl> that the youths were murdered, and when they were dead their wives cut off their heads, to prove to their father that they had done the dreadful deed. </p>
<p id='2.24.3'><b>2.24.3</b> On the top of <pl id='Q1012861'>Larisa</pl> is a temple of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, surnamed <prn id='Q107349775'>Larisaean</prn>, which has no roof; the wooden image I found no longer standing upon its pedestal. There is also a temple of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> worth seeing. Here are placed offerings, including a <prn id='Q693222'>xoanon</prn> (wooden image) of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, which has two eyes in the natural place and a third on its forehead. This <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, they say, was <prn id='Q11940519'>Patroos</prn> (ancestral) of <prn id='Q170473'>Priam</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q332324'>Laomedon</prn>, set up in the uncovered part of his court, and when <pl id='Q22647'>Ilion</pl> was taken by the Greeks <prn id='Q170473'>Priam</prn> took sanctuary at the altar of this god. When the spoils were divided, <prn id='Q1060267'>Sthenelus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q833806'>Capaneus</prn>, received the image, and for this reason it has been dedicated here. </p>
<p id='2.24.4'><b>2.24.4</b> The reason for its three eyes one might infer to be this. That <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> is king in heaven is a saying common to all men. As for him who is said to rule under the earth, there is a verse of <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> which calls him, too, <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>: “<prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> Katachthonios (of the underworld), and the august <prn id='Q45967'>Persephonea</prn>.” The god in the sea, also, is called <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> by <prn id='Q40939'>Aeschylus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q13410739'>Euphorion</prn>. So whoever made the image made it with three eyes, as signifying that this same god rules in all the three “allotments” of the universe, as they are called. </p>
<p id='2.24.5'><b>2.24.5</b> From <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> are roads to various parts of the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl>, including one to <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl> on the side towards <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl>. On the right is Mount Lycone, which has trees on it, chiefly cypresses. On the top of the mountain is built a sanctuary of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> <prn id='Q105335595'>Orthia</prn>, and there have been made white-marble images of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, <prn id='Q103107'>Leto</prn>, and <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, which they say are works of <prn id='Q193422'>Polycleitus</prn>. On descending again from the mountain you see on the left of the highway a temple of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.24.6'><b>2.24.6</b> A little farther on there is on the right of the road a mountain called Chaon. At its foot grow cultivated trees, and here the water of the <pl id='Q12877267'>Erasinus</pl> rises to the surface. Up to this point it flows from <pl id='Q2359730'>Stymphalus</pl> in <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl>, just as the Rheiti, near the sea at <pl id='Q11918833'>Eleusis</pl>, flow from the <pl id='Q1137741'>Euripus</pl>. At the places where the <pl id='Q12877267'>Erasinus</pl> gushes forth from the mountain they sacrifice to <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> and to <prn id='Q132582'>Pan</prn>, and to <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> they also hold a festival called <prn id='Q16331743'>Tyrbe</prn> (Throng). </p>
<p id='2.24.7'><b>2.24.7</b> On returning to the road that leads to <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl> you see <pl id='Q16554749'>Cenchreae</pl> on the right of what is called the Wheel. Why the place received this name they do not say. Perhaps in this case also it was <prn id='Q57208772'>Cenchrias</prn>, son of <prn id='Q4843985'>Peirene</prn>, that caused it to be so called. Here is the polyandrion of the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> who conquered the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> in battle at <pl id='Q16575296'>Hysiae</pl>. This fight took place, I discovered, when <prn id='Q91071400'>Peisistratus was archon</prn> [669/5 BCE] at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, in the fourth year of the <prn id='Q57337693'>twenty-seventh Olympiad</prn> [669 BCE], in which the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl>, <prn id='Q19847342'>Eurybotus</prn>, won the foot-race. On coming down to a lower level you reach the ruins of <pl id='Q16575296'>Hysiae</pl>, which once was a city in <pl id='Q12649101'>Argolis</pl>, and here it is that they say the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> suffered their reverse. </p>
<p id='2.25.1'><b>2.25.1</b> The road from <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> to <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantinea</pl> is not the same as that to <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl>, but begins from the gate at Deirai (the Ridge). On this road is a sanctuary built with two rooms, having an entrance on the west side and another on the east. At the latter is a wooden image of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>, and at the west entrance one of <prn id='Q40901'>Ares</prn>. They say that the images are votive offerings of <prn id='Q334817'>Polyneices</prn> and of the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> who joined him in the campaign to redress his wrongs. </p>
<p id='2.25.2'><b>2.25.2</b> Farther on from here, across the torrent called <pl id='Q25238207'>Charadrus</pl> (Gully), is <pl id='Q30909902'>Oenoe</pl>, named, the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> say, after <prn id='Q749966'>Oeneus</prn>. The story is that <prn id='Q749966'>Oeneus</prn>, who was king in <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolia</pl>, on being driven from his throne by the sons of <prn id='Q396862'>Agrius</prn>, took refuge with <prn id='Q208256'>Diomedes</prn> at <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>, who aided him by an expedition into <pl id='Q750313'>Calydonia</pl>, but said that he could not remain with him, and urged <prn id='Q749966'>Oeneus</prn> to accompany him, if he wished, to <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>. When he came, he gave him all the attention that it was right to give a father's father, and on his death buried him here. After him the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> name the place <pl id='Q30909902'>Oenoe</pl>. </p>
<p id='2.25.3'><b>2.25.3</b> Above <pl id='Q30909902'>Oenoe</pl> is Mount <pl id='Q25105451'>Artemisius</pl>, with a sanctuary of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> on the top. On this mountain are also the springs of the river <pl id='Q677269'>Inachus</pl>. For it really has springs, though the water does not run far. </p>
<p id='2.25.4'><b>2.25.4</b> Here I found nothing else that is worth seeing. There is another road, that leads to <pl id='Q16591866'>Lyrcea</pl> from the gate at Deirai. The story is that to this place came <prn id='Q7877819'>Lynceus</prn>, being the only one of the fifty brothers to escape death, and that on his escape he raised a beacon here. Now to raise the beacon was the signal he had agreed with <prn id='Q472784'>Hypermestra</prn> to give if he should escape <prn id='Q210883'>Danaus</prn> and reach a place of safety. She also, they say, lighted a beacon on <pl id='Q1012861'>Larisa</pl> as a sign that she too was now out of danger. For this reason the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> hold every year a beacon festival. </p>
<p id='2.25.5'><b>2.25.5</b> At the first the place was called Lyncea; its present name is derived from <prn id='Q65087714'>Lyrcus</prn>, a bastard son of <prn id='Q305607'>Abas</prn>, who afterwards dwelt there. Among the ruins are several things not worth mentioning, besides a figure of <prn id='Q65087714'>Lyrcus</prn> upon a slab. The distance from <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> to <pl id='Q16591866'>Lyrcea</pl> is about sixty stades, and the distance from <pl id='Q16591866'>Lyrcea</pl> to <pl id='Q7103538'>Orneae</pl> is the same. <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> in the <prn id='Q1233048'>Catalogue</prn> makes no mention of the city <pl id='Q16591866'>Lyrcea</pl>, because at the time of the Greek expedition against <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl> it already lay deserted; <pl id='Q7103538'>Orneae</pl>, however, was inhabited, and in his poem he places it on the list before <pl id='Q1412043'>Phlius</pl> and <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl>, which order corresponds to the position of the towns in the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl> territory. </p>
<p id='2.25.6'><b>2.25.6</b> The name is derived from <prn id='Q1985130'>Orneus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q301219'>Erechtheus</prn>. This <prn id='Q1985130'>Orneus</prn> begat <prn id='Q2551733'>Peteos</prn>, and <prn id='Q2551733'>Peteos</prn> begat <prn id='Q781867'>Menestheus</prn>, who, with a body of <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, helped <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn> to destroy the kingdom of <prn id='Q170473'>Priam</prn>. From him then did <pl id='Q7103538'>Orneae</pl> get its name, and afterwards the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> removed all its citizens, who thereupon came to live at <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>. At <pl id='Q7103538'>Orneae</pl> are a sanctuary and an upright wooden image of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>; there is besides a temple devoted to all the gods in common. On the further side of <pl id='Q7103538'>Orneae</pl> are <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonia</pl> and <pl id='Q1412043'>Phliasia</pl>. </p>
<p id='2.25.7'><b>2.25.7</b> On the way from <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> to <pl id='Q233576'>Epidauria</pl> there is on the right a building made very like a pyramid, and on it in relief are wrought shields of the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl> shape. Here took place a fight for the throne between <prn id='Q644604'>Proetus</prn> and <prn id='Q208017'>Acrisius</prn>; the contest, they say, ended in a draw, and a reconciliation resulted afterwards, as neither could gain a decisive victory. The story is that they and their hosts were armed with shields, which were first used in this battle. For those that fell on either side was built here a common tomb, as they were fellow citizens and kinsmen. </p>
<p id='2.25.8'><b>2.25.8</b> Going on from here and turning to the right, you come to the ruins of <pl id='Q217379'>Tiryns</pl>. The <pl id='Q217379'>Tirynthians</pl> also were removed by the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>, who wished to make <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> more powerful by adding to the population. The hero <prn id='Q12296369'>Tiryns</prn>, from whom the city derived its name, is said to have been a son of <prn id='Q649476'>Argus</prn>, a son of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>. The wall, which is the only part of the ruins still remaining, is a work of the <prn id='Q128430'>Cyclopes</prn> made of unwrought stones, each stone being so big that a pair of mules could not move the smallest from its place to the slightest degree. Long ago small stones were so inserted that each of them binds the large blocks firmly together. </p>
<p id='2.25.9'><b>2.25.9</b> Going down seawards, you come to the chambers of the <prn id='Q11827646'>daughters</prn> of <prn id='Q644604'>Proetus</prn>. On returning to the highway you will reach <prn id='Q174278'>Medea</prn> on the left hand. They say that <prn id='Q26296'>Electryon</prn>, the father of <prn id='Q190543'>Alcmena</prn>, was king of <prn id='Q174278'>Medea</prn>, but in my time nothing was left of it except the foundations. </p>
<p id='2.25.10'><b>2.25.10</b> On the straight road to <pl id='Q233576'>Epidaurus</pl> is a village <pl id='Q12880025'>Lessa</pl>, in which is a temple of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> with a wooden image exactly like the one on the acropolis <pl id='Q1012861'>Larisa</pl>. Above <pl id='Q12880025'>Lessa</pl> is Mount <pl id='Q17521327'>Arachnaion</pl>, which long ago, in the time of <prn id='Q735623'>Inachus</prn>, was named Sapyselaton. On it are altars to <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> and <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn>. When rain is needed they sacrifice to them here. </p>
<p id='2.26.1'><b>2.26.1</b> At <pl id='Q12880025'>Lessa</pl> the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl> territory joins that of <pl id='Q233576'>Epidaurus</pl>. But before you reach <pl id='Q233576'>Epidaurus</pl> itself you will come to the <pl id='Q7698713'>sanctuary of Asclepius</pl>. Who dwelt in this land before <prn id='Q3726853'>Epidaurus</prn> came to it I do not know, nor could I discover from the natives the descendants of <prn id='Q3726853'>Epidaurus</prn> either. But the last king before the <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn> arrived in the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl> was, they say, <prn id='Q24055272'>Pityreus</prn>, a descendant of <prn id='Q853462'>Ion</prn>, son of <prn id='Q514746'>Xuthus</prn>, and they relate that he handed over the land to <prn id='Q912772'>Deiphontes</prn> and the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> without a struggle. </p>
<p id='2.26.2'><b>2.26.2</b> He went to <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> with his people and dwelt there, while <prn id='Q912772'>Deiphontes</prn> and the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> took possession of <pl id='Q233576'>Epidauria</pl>. These on the death of <prn id='Q636796'>Temenus</prn> seceded from the other <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>; <prn id='Q912772'>Deiphontes</prn> and <prn id='Q830706'>Hyrnetho</prn> through hatred of the sons of <prn id='Q636796'>Temenus</prn>, and the army with them, because it respected <prn id='Q912772'>Deiphontes</prn> and <prn id='Q830706'>Hyrnetho</prn> more than <prn id='Q1738025'>Ceisus</prn> and his brothers. <prn id='Q3726853'>Epidaurus</prn>, who gave the land its name, was, the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> say, a son of <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn> but, according to <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl> opinion and the poem the Great <prn id='Q1233074'>Eoeae</prn>, the father of <prn id='Q3726853'>Epidaurus</prn> was <prn id='Q649476'>Argus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, while the <pl id='Q233576'>Epidaurians</pl> maintain that <prn id='Q3726853'>Epidaurus</prn> was the child of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.26.3'><b>2.26.3</b> That the land is especially sacred to <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> is due to the following reason. The <pl id='Q233576'>Epidaurians</pl> say that <prn id='Q831583'>Phlegyas</prn> came to the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl>, ostensibly to see the land, but really to spy out the number of the inhabitants, and whether the greater part of them was warlike. For <prn id='Q831583'>Phlegyas</prn> was the greatest soldier of his time, and making forays in all directions he carried off the crops and lifted the <prn id='Q830'>cattle</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.26.4'><b>2.26.4</b> When he went to the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl>, he was accompanied by his daughter, who all along had kept hidden from her father that she was with child by <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>. In the country of the <pl id='Q233576'>Epidaurians</pl> she bore a son, and exposed him on the mountain called <prn id='Q109941874'>Titthion</prn> (Nipple) at the present day, but then named MyrtiumYY. As the child lay exposed he was given milk by one of the <prn id='Q2934'>goats</prn> that pastured about the mountain, and was guarded by the watch-<prn id='Q144'>dog</prn> of the herd. </p>
<p id='2.26.5'><b>2.26.5</b> And when <prn id='Q55485303'>Aresthanas</prn> (for this was the herdsman's name) discovered that the tale of the <prn id='Q2934'>goats</prn> was not full, and that the watch-<prn id='Q144'>dog</prn> also was absent from the herd, he left, they say, no stone unturned, and on finding the child desired to take him up. As he drew near he saw lightning that flashed from the child, and, thinking that it was something divine, as in fact it was, he turned away. Presently it was reported over every land and sea that <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> was discovering everything he wished to heal the sick, and that he was raising dead men to life. </p>
<p id='2.26.6'><b>2.26.6</b> There is also another tradition concerning him. <prn id='Q725286'>Coronis</prn>, they say, when with child with <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>, had intercourse with <prn id='Q2479189'>Ischys</prn>, son of <prn id='Q4530734'>Elatus</prn>. She was killed by <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> to punish her for the insult done to <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, but when the pyre was already lighted <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> is said to have snatched the child from the flames. </p>
<p id='2.26.7'><b>2.26.7</b> The third account is, in my opinion, the farthest from the truth; it makes <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> to be the son of <prn id='Q9160370'>Arsinoe</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q165589'>Leucippus</prn>. For when <prn id='Q619488'>Apollophanes</prn> the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadian</pl>, came to <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> and asked the god if <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> was the son of <prn id='Q9160370'>Arsinoe</prn> and therefore a <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl>, the <prn id='Q220344'>Pythian priestess</prn> gave this response: <br>“<prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>, born to bestow great joy upon mortals, <br>Pledge of the mutual love I enjoyed with <prn id='Q831583'>Phlegyas</prn>' daughter, <br>Lovely <prn id='Q725286'>Coronis</prn>, who bare thee in rugged land <pl id='Q233576'>Epidaurus</pl>.” <br>This oracle makes it quite certain that <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> was not a son of <prn id='Q9160370'>Arsinoe</prn>, and that the story was a fiction invented by <prn id='Q44233'>Hesiod</prn>, or by one of <prn id='Q44233'>Hesiod</prn>'s interpolators, just to please the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>. </p>
<p id='2.26.8'><b>2.26.8</b> There is other evidence that the god was born in <pl id='Q7698713'>Epidaurus</pl> for I find that the most famous sanctuaries of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> had their origin from <pl id='Q233576'>Epidaurus</pl>. In the first place, the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, who say that they gave a share of their mystic rites to <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>, call this day of the festival Epidauria, and they allege that their worship of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> dates from then. Again, when ArchiasYY, son of AristaechYY, was healed in <pl id='Q7698713'>Epidauria</pl> after spraining himself while hunting about PindasusYY, he brought the cult to <pl id='Q18986'>Pergamus</pl>. </p>
<p id='2.26.9'><b>2.26.9</b> From the one at <pl id='Q18986'>Pergamus</pl> has been built in our own day the sanctuary of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> by the sea at Smyrna. Further, at Balagrae of the <pl id='Q44112'>Cyreneans</pl> there is an <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> called <prn id='Q107349776'>Iatros</prn> (Healer), who like the others came from <pl id='Q233576'>Epidaurus</pl>. From the one at <pl id='Q44112'>Cyrene</pl> was founded the sanctuary of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> at <pl id='Q11931287'>Lebene</pl>, in <pl id='Q4752820'>Crete</pl>. There is this difference between the <pl id='Q44112'>Cyreneans</pl> and the <pl id='Q233576'>Epidaurians</pl>, that whereas the former sacrifice <prn id='Q2934'>goats</prn>, it is against the custom of the <pl id='Q233576'>Epidaurians</pl> to do so. </p>
<p id='2.26.10'><b>2.26.10</b> That <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> was considered a god from the first, and did not receive the title only in course of time, I infer from several signs, including the evidence of <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>, who makes <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn> say about <prn id='Q674319'>Machaon</prn>: “<prn id='Q1367860'>Talthybius</prn>, with all speed go summon me hither <prn id='Q674319'>Machaon</prn>, mortal son of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>.” As who should say, “human son of a god.” </p>
<p id='2.27.1'><b>2.27.1</b> The <pl id='Q7698713'>sacred grove of Asclepius</pl> is surrounded on all sides by boundary marks. No death or birth takes place within the enclosure the same custom prevails also in the island of <pl id='Q173148'>Delos</pl>. All the offerings, whether the offerer be one of the <pl id='Q233576'>Epidaurians</pl> themselves or a stranger, are entirely consumed within the bounds. At <pl id='Q59637009'>Titane</pl> too, I know, there is the same rule. </p>
<p id='2.27.2'><b>2.27.2</b> The image of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> is, in size, half as big as the <prn id='Q106460486'>Olympian</prn> <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, and is made of ivory and gold. An inscription tells us that the artist was <prn id='Q1320502'>Thrasymedes</prn>, a <pl id='Q65040323'>Parian</pl>, son of Arignotus. The god is sitting on a seat grasping a staff; the other hand he is holding above the head of the <prn id='Q2102'>serpent</prn>; there is also a figure of a <prn id='Q144'>dog</prn> lying by his side. On the seat are wrought in relief the exploits of <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl> heroes, that of <prn id='Q189872'>Bellerophontes</prn> against the <prn id='Q182790'>Chimaera</prn>, and <prn id='Q130832'>Perseus</prn>, who has cut off the head of <prn id='Q160730'>Medusa</prn>. Over against the <pl id='Q38279727'>temple</pl> is the <pl id='Q38279704'>place</pl> where the suppliants of the god sleep. </p>
<p id='2.27.3'><b>2.27.3</b> Near has been built a circular building of white marble, called <pl id='Q38279699'>Tholos</pl>, which is worth seeing. In it is a picture by <prn id='Q1533115'>Pausias</prn> representing <prn id='Q121973'>Eros</prn>, who has cast aside his bow and arrows, and is carrying instead of them a lyre that he has taken up. Here there is also another work of <prn id='Q1533115'>Pausias</prn>, <prn id='Q2391464'>Drunkenness</prn> drinking out of a crystal cup. You can see even in the painting a crystal cup and a woman's face through it. Within the enclosure stood slabs; in my time six remained, but of old there were more. On them are inscribed the names of both the men and the women who have been healed by <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>, the disease also from which each suffered, and the means of cure. The dialect is <prn id='Q285494'>Doric</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.27.4'><b>2.27.4</b> Apart from the others is an old slab, which declares that <prn id='Q338201'>Hippolytus</prn> dedicated twenty <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn> to the god. The <pl id='Q18043236'>Aricians</pl> tell a tale that agrees with the inscription on this slab, that when <prn id='Q338201'>Hippolytus</prn> was killed, owing to the curses of <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>, <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> raised him from the dead. On coming to life again he refused to forgive his father rejecting his prayers, he went to the <pl id='Q18043236'>Aricians</pl> in <pl id='Q913582'>Italy</pl>. There he became king and devoted a precinct to <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, where down to my time the prize for the victor in single combat was the priesthood of the goddess. The contest was open to no freeman, but only to slaves who had run away from their masters. </p>
<p id='2.27.5'><b>2.27.5</b> The <pl id='Q7698713'>Epidaurians</pl> have a <pl id='Q608198'>theater</pl> within the sanctuary, in my opinion very well worth seeing. For while the Roman theaters are far superior to those anywhere else in their splendor, and the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadian</pl> <pl id='Q22681531'>theater</pl> at <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl> is unequalled for size, what architect could seriously rival <prn id='Q193422'>Polycleitus</prn> in symmetry and beauty? For it was <prn id='Q193422'>Polycleitus</prn> who built both this theater and the <pl id='Q38279699'>circular building</pl>. Within the grove are a <pl id='Q38279721'>temple</pl> of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, an image of <prn id='Q2089459'>Epione</prn>, a sanctuary of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> and <prn id='Q159168'>Themis</prn>, a <pl id='Q22681278'>race-course</pl> consisting, like most Greek race-courses, of a bank of earth, and a fountain worth seeing for its roof and general splendour. </p>
<p id='2.27.6'><b>2.27.6</b> A Roman senator, <prn id='Q123279442'>Antoninus</prn>, made in our own day a bath of Asclepius and a sanctuary of the gods they call <prn id='Q5382860'>Epidotes</prn> (Bountiful. He made also a temple to <prn id='Q202257'>Health</prn>, <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>, and <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, the last two surnamed <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptian</pl>. He moreover restored the portico that was named the Stoa of Cotys, which, as the brick of which it was made had been unburnt, had fallen into utter ruin after it had lost its roof. As the <pl id='Q233576'>Epidaurians</pl> about the sanctuary were in great distress, because their women had no shelter in which to be delivered and the sick breathed their last in the open, he provided a dwelling, so that these grievances also were redressed. Here at last was a place in which without sin a human being could die and a woman be delivered. </p>
<p id='2.27.7'><b>2.27.7</b> Above the grove are Mt. <prn id='Q109941874'>Titthion</prn> (Nipple) and another mountain called <prn id='Q60847385'>Cynortium</prn>; on the latter is a <pl id='Q619242'>sanctuary</pl> of <prn id='Q60847441'>Maleatian</prn> <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>. The sanctuary itself is an ancient one, but among the things <prn id='Q123279442'>Antoninus</prn> made for the <pl id='Q233576'>Epidaurians</pl> are various appurtenances for the sanctuary of the <prn id='Q60847441'>Maleatian</prn>, including a reservoir into which the rain-water collects for their use. </p>
<p id='2.28.1'><b>2.28.1</b> The <prn id='Q2102'>serpents</prn>, including a peculiar kind of a yellowish color, are considered sacred to <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>, and are tame with men. These are peculiar to <pl id='Q233576'>Epidauria</pl>, and I have noticed that other lands have their peculiar animals. For in <pl id='Q2370577'>Libya</pl> only are to be found land crocodiles at least two cubits long; from <pl id='Q17055962'>India</pl> alone are brought, among other creatures, parrots. But the big <prn id='Q2102'>snakes</prn> that grow to more than thirty cubits, such as are found in <pl id='Q17055962'>India</pl> and in <pl id='Q2370577'>Libya</pl>, are said by the <pl id='Q233576'>Epidaurians</pl> not to be <prn id='Q2102'>serpents</prn>, but some other kind of creature. </p>
<p id='2.28.2'><b>2.28.2</b> As you go up to Mount <pl id='Q24992917'>Coryphum</pl> you see by the road an olive tree called Streptes (twisted). It was <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> who gave it this shape by bending it round with his hand, but I cannot say whether he set it to be a boundary mark against the <pl id='Q1154474'>Asinaeans</pl> in <pl id='Q12649101'>Argolis</pl>, since in no land that has been depopulated is it easy to discover the truth about the boundaries. On the top of the mountain there is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> <prn id='Q58818178'>Coryphaea</prn> (of the Peak), of which <prn id='Q287216'>Telesilla</prn> made mention in an ode. </p>
<p id='2.28.3'><b>2.28.3</b> On going down to the city of the <pl id='Q233576'>Epidaurians</pl>, you come to a place where wild olives grow; they call it <pl id='Q1641569'>Hyrnethium</pl>. I will relate the story of it, which is probable enough, as given by the <pl id='Q233576'>Epidaurians</pl>. <prn id='Q1738025'>Ceisus</prn> and the other sons of <prn id='Q636796'>Temenus</prn> knew that they would grieve <prn id='Q912772'>Deiphontes</prn> most if they could find a way to part him and <prn id='Q830706'>Hyrnetho</prn>. So <prn id='Q16330320'>Cerynes</prn> and <prn id='Q1518328'>Phalces</prn> (for <prn id='Q17516325'>Agraeus</prn>, the youngest, disapproved of their plan) came to <pl id='Q233576'>Epidaurus</pl>. Staying their chariot under the wall, they sent a herald to their sister, pretending that they wished to parley with her. </p>
<p id='2.28.4'><b>2.28.4</b> When she obeyed their summons, the young men began to make many accusations against <prn id='Q912772'>Deiphontes</prn>, and besought her much that she would return to <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>, promising, among other things, to give her to a husband in every respect better than <prn id='Q912772'>Deiphontes</prn>, one who ruled over more subjects and a more prosperous country. But <prn id='Q830706'>Hyrnetho</prn>, pained at their words, gave as good as she had received, retorting that <prn id='Q912772'>Deiphontes</prn> was a dear husband to her, and had shown himself a blameless son-in-law to <prn id='Q636796'>Temenus</prn>; as for them, they ought to be called the murderers of <prn id='Q636796'>Temenus</prn> rather than his sons. </p>
<p id='2.28.5'><b>2.28.5</b> Without further reply the youths seized her, placed her in the chariot, and drove away. An <pl id='Q233576'>Epidaurian</pl> told <prn id='Q912772'>Deiphontes</prn> that <prn id='Q16330320'>Cerynes</prn> and <prn id='Q1518328'>Phalces</prn> had gone, taking with them <prn id='Q830706'>Hyrnetho</prn> against her will; he himself rushed to the rescue with all speed, and as the <pl id='Q233576'>Epidaurians</pl> learned the news they reinforced him. On overtaking the runaways, <prn id='Q912772'>Deiphontes</prn> shot <prn id='Q16330320'>Cerynes</prn> and killed him, but he was afraid to shoot at <prn id='Q1518328'>Phalces</prn>, who was holding <prn id='Q830706'>Hyrnetho</prn>, lest he should miss him and become the slayer of his wife; so he closed with them and tried to get her away. But <prn id='Q1518328'>Phalces</prn>, holding on and dragging her with greater violence, killed her, as she was with child. </p>
<p id='2.28.6'><b>2.28.6</b> Realizing what he had done to his sister, he began to drive the chariot more recklessly, as he was anxious to gain a start before all the <pl id='Q233576'>Epidaurians</pl> could gather against him. <prn id='Q912772'>Deiphontes</prn> and his children — for before this children had been born to him, <prn id='Q17542231'>Antimenes</prn>, <prn id='Q17516399'>Xanthippus</prn>, and <prn id='Q17516372'>Argeus</prn>, and a daughter, <prn id='Q17454800'>Orsobia</prn>, who, they say, afterwards married <prn id='Q2446711'>Pamphylus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q404326'>Aegimius</prn> — took up the dead body of <prn id='Q830706'>Hyrnetho</prn> and carried it to this place, which in course of time was named <pl id='Q1641569'>Hyrnethium</pl>. </p>
<p id='2.28.7'><b>2.28.7</b> They built for her a hero-shrine, and bestowed upon her various honors; in particular, the custom was established that nobody should carry home, or use for any purpose, the pieces that break off the olive trees, or any other trees, that grow there; these are left there on the spot to be sacred to <prn id='Q830706'>Hyrnetho</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.28.8'><b>2.28.8</b> Not far from the city is the tomb of <prn id='Q11936418'>Melissa</prn>, who married <prn id='Q328793'>Periander</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q430688'>Cypselus</prn>, and another of <prn id='Q11942850'>Procles</prn>, the father of <prn id='Q11936418'>Melissa</prn>. He, too, was tyrant of <pl id='Q233576'>Epidaurus</pl>, as <prn id='Q328793'>Periander</prn>, his son-in-law, was tyrant of <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl>. </p>
<p id='2.29.1'><b>2.29.1</b> The most noteworthy things which I found the city of <pl id='Q233576'>Epidaurus</pl> itself had to show are these. There is, of course, a precinct of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>, with images of the god himself and of <prn id='Q2089459'>Epione</prn>. <prn id='Q2089459'>Epione</prn>, they say, was the wife of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>. These are of <pl id='Q65040323'>Parian</pl> marble, and are set up in the open. There is also in the city a temple of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> and <pl id='Q107433989'>one of Artemis</pl>. The figure of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> one might take to be the goddess hunting. There is also a sanctuary of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>, while the one at the harbor, on a height that juts out into the sea, they say is <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn>'s. The <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> on the acropolis, a <prn id='Q693222'>xoanon</prn> worth seeing, they surname <prn id='Q57521531'>Cissaea</prn> (ivy goddess). </p>
<p id='2.29.2'><b>2.29.2</b> The <pl id='Q191082'>Aeginetans</pl> dwell in the island over against <pl id='Q233576'>Epidauria</pl>. It is said that in the beginning there were no men in it; but after <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> brought to it, when uninhabited, <pl id='Q191082'>Aegina</pl>, daughter of <prn id='Q622781'>Asopus</prn>, its name was changed from <prn id='Q858671'>Oenone</prn> to <pl id='Q191082'>Aegina</pl>; and when <prn id='Q206187'>Aeacus</prn>, on growing up, asked <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> for settlers, the god, they say, raised up the inhabitants out of the earth. They can mention no king of the island except <prn id='Q206187'>Aeacus</prn>, since we know of none even of the sons of <prn id='Q206187'>Aeacus</prn> who stayed there; for to <prn id='Q178641'>Peleus</prn> and <prn id='Q331327'>Telamon</prn> befell exile for the murder of <prn id='Q836311'>Phocus</prn>, while the sons of <prn id='Q836311'>Phocus</prn> made their home about <pl id='Q105261'>Parnassus</pl>, in the land that is now called <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl>. </p>
<p id='2.29.3'><b>2.29.3</b> This name had already been given to the land, at the time when <prn id='Q3381352'>Phocus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q2031315'>Ornytion</prn>, came to it a generation previously. In the time, then, of this <prn id='Q3381352'>Phocus</prn> only the district about <pl id='Q56697763'>Tithorea</pl> and <pl id='Q105261'>Parnassus</pl> was called <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl>, but in the time of <prn id='Q206187'>Aeacus</prn> the name spread to all from the borders of the <prn id='Q1065225'>Minyae</prn> at <pl id='Q543895'>Orchomenos</pl> to <pl id='Q3475188'>Scarphea</pl> among the <pl id='Q3836325'>Locri</pl>. </p>
<p id='2.29.4'><b>2.29.4</b> From <prn id='Q178641'>Peleus</prn> sprang the kings in <pl id='Q565751'>Epeirus</pl>; but as for the sons of <prn id='Q331327'>Telamon</prn>, the family of <prn id='Q172725'>Ajax</prn> is undistinguished, because he was a man who lived a private life; though <prn id='Q210350'>Miltiades</prn>, who led the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> to <pl id='Q31900'>Marathon</pl>, and <prn id='Q218102'>Cimon</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q210350'>Miltiades</prn>, achieved renown; but the family of <prn id='Q878184'>Teucer</prn> continued to be the royal house in <pl id='Q644636'>Cyprus</pl> down to the time of <prn id='Q463301'>Evagoras</prn>. <prn id='Q730625'>Asius</prn> the epic poet says that to <prn id='Q836311'>Phocus</prn> were born <prn id='Q3893378'>Panopeus</prn> and <prn id='Q1445864'>Crisus</prn>. To <prn id='Q3893378'>Panopeus</prn> was born <prn id='Q278930'>Epeus</prn>, who made, according to <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>, the <prn id='Q50193'>Wooden Horse</prn>; and the grandson of <prn id='Q1445864'>Crisus</prn> was <prn id='Q494886'>Pylades</prn>, whose father was <prn id='Q1421896'>Strophius</prn>, son of <prn id='Q1445864'>Crisus</prn>, while his mother was <prn id='Q284487'>Anaxibia</prn>, sister of <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn>. Such was the pedigree of the <prn id='Q403361'>Aeacidae</prn> (family of. <prn id='Q206187'>Aeacus</prn>), as they are called, but they departed from the beginning to other lands. </p>
<p id='2.29.5'><b>2.29.5</b> Subsequently a division of the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> who, under <prn id='Q912772'>Deiphontes</prn>, had seized <pl id='Q233576'>Epidaurus</pl>, crossed to <pl id='Q191082'>Aegina</pl>, and, settling among the old <pl id='Q191082'>Aeginetans</pl>, established in the island <prn id='Q203711'>Dorian</prn> manners and the <prn id='Q285494'>Dorian</prn> dialect. Although the <pl id='Q191082'>Aeginetans</pl> rose to great power, so that their navy was superior to that of <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, and in the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl> war supplied more ships than any state except <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, yet their prosperity was not permanent but when the island was depopulated by the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, they took up their abode at <pl id='Q3036391'>Thyrea</pl>, in <pl id='Q12649101'>Argolis</pl>, which the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> gave them to dwell in. They recovered their island when the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> warships were captured in the <pl id='Q6514'>Hellespont</pl>, yet it was never given them to rise again to their old wealth or power. </p>
<p id='2.29.6'><b>2.29.6</b> Of the Greek islands, <pl id='Q191082'>Aegina</pl> is the most difficult of access, for it is surrounded by sunken rocks and reefs which rise up. The story is that <prn id='Q206187'>Aeacus</prn> devised this feature of set purpose, because he feared <prn id='Q10729326'>piratical</prn> raids by sea, and wished the approach to be perilous to enemies. Near the harbor in which vessels mostly anchor is a temple of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>, and in the most conspicuous part of the city what is called the shrine of <prn id='Q206187'>Aeacus</prn>, a quadrangular enclosure of white marble. </p>
<p id='2.29.7'><b>2.29.7</b> Wrought in relief at the entrance are the envoys whom the Greeks once dispatched to <prn id='Q206187'>Aeacus</prn>. The reason for the embassy given by the <pl id='Q191082'>Aeginetans</pl> is the same as that which the other Greeks assign. A drought had for some time afflicted Greece, and no rain fell either beyond the <pl id='Q215200'>Isthmus</pl> or in the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl>, until at last they sent envoys to <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> to ask what was the cause and to beg for deliverance from the evil. The <prn id='Q220344'>Pythian priestess</prn> bade them propitiate <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, saying that he would not listen to them unless the one to supplicate him were <prn id='Q206187'>Aeacus</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.29.8'><b>2.29.8</b> And so envoys came with a request to <prn id='Q206187'>Aeacus</prn> from each city. By sacrifice and prayer to <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q107315999'>Panhellenios</prn> (of all the Greeks), he caused rain to fall upon the earth, and the <pl id='Q191082'>Aeginetans</pl> made these likenesses of those who came to him. Within the enclosure are olive trees that have grown there from of old, and there is an altar which is raised but a little from the ground. That this altar is also the tomb of <prn id='Q206187'>Aeacus</prn> is told as a holy secret. </p>
<p id='2.29.9'><b>2.29.9</b> Beside the shrine of <prn id='Q206187'>Aeacus</prn> is the grave of <prn id='Q836311'>Phocus</prn>, a barrow surrounded by a basement, and on it lies a rough stone. When <prn id='Q331327'>Telamon</prn> and <prn id='Q178641'>Peleus</prn> had induced <prn id='Q836311'>Phocus</prn> to compete at the pentathlon, and it was now the turn of <prn id='Q178641'>Peleus</prn> to hurl the stone, which they were using for a quoit, he intentionally hit <prn id='Q836311'>Phocus</prn>. The act was done to please their mother; for, while they were both born of the daughter of <prn id='Q1469237'>Sciron</prn>, <prn id='Q836311'>Phocus</prn> was not, being, if indeed the report of the Greeks be true, the son of a sister of <prn id='Q184437'>Thetis</prn>. I believe it was for this reason, and not only out of friendship for <prn id='Q192407'>Orestes</prn>, that <prn id='Q494886'>Pylades</prn> plotted the murder of <prn id='Q322639'>Neoptolemus</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.29.10'><b>2.29.10</b> When this blow of the quoit killed <prn id='Q836311'>Phocus</prn>, the sons of <prn id='Q2293816'>Endeis</prn> boarded a ship and fled. Afterwards <prn id='Q331327'>Telamon</prn> sent a herald denying that he had plotted the death of <prn id='Q836311'>Phocus</prn>. <prn id='Q206187'>Aeacus</prn>, however, refused to allow him to land on the island, and bade him make his defence standing on board ship, or if he wished, from a mole raised in the sea. So he sailed into the harbor called Secret, and proceeded to make a mole by night. This was finished, and still remains at the present day. But <prn id='Q331327'>Telamon</prn>, being condemned as implicated in the murder of <prn id='Q836311'>Phocus</prn>, sailed away a second time and came to <pl id='Q202422'>Salamis</pl>. </p>
<p id='2.29.11'><b>2.29.11</b> Not far from the Secret Harbor is a theater worth seeing; it is very similar to the one at <pl id='Q233576'>Epidaurus</pl>, both in size and in style. Behind it is built one side of a race-course, which not only itself holds up the theater, but also in turn uses it as a support. </p>
<p id='2.30.1'><b>2.30.1</b> There are three temples close together, one of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, one of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, and a third of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>. <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> has a naked <prn id='Q693222'>xoanon</prn> of native workmanship, but <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> is dressed, and so, too, is <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>, who is, moreover, represented with a beard. The sanctuary of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> is not here, but in another place, and his image is of stone, and seated. </p>
<p id='2.30.2'><b>2.30.2</b> Of the gods, the <pl id='Q191082'>Aeginetans</pl> worship most <prn id='Q131575'>Hecate</prn>, in whose honor every year they celebrate mystic rites which, they say, <prn id='Q174353'>Orpheus</prn> the Thracian established among them. Within the enclosure is a temple; its <prn id='Q693222'>xoanon</prn> is the work of <prn id='Q192211'>Myron</prn> [doubtful], and it has one face and one body. It was <prn id='Q505640'>Alcamenes</prn>, in my opinion, who first made three images of <prn id='Q131575'>Hecate</prn> attached to one another, a figure called by the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> <prn id='Q19739284'>Epipurgidia</prn> (on the Tower); it stands beside the <pl id='Q384813'>temple</pl> of the <prn id='Q55404088'>Wingless</prn> <prn id='Q165023'>Victory</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.30.3'><b>2.30.3</b> In <pl id='Q191082'>Aegina</pl>, as you go towards the mountain of <pl id='Q110302685'>Panhellenion Zeus</pl>, you reach a <pl id='Q596988'>sanctuary</pl> of <prn id='Q618401'>Aphaea</prn>, in whose honor <prn id='Q134929'>Pindar</prn> composed an ode for the <pl id='Q191082'>Aeginetans</pl>. The <pl id='Q4752820'>Cretans</pl> say (the story of <prn id='Q618401'>Aphaea</prn> is <pl id='Q4752820'>Cretan</pl>) that <prn id='Q11912529'>Carmanor</prn>, who purified <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> after he had killed <prn id='Q15721'>Pytho</prn>, was the father of <prn id='Q1352687'>Eubulus</prn>, and that the daughter of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> and of <prn id='Q1734053'>Carme</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q1352687'>Eubulus</prn>, was <prn id='Q831577'>Britomartis</prn>. She took delight, they say, in running and in the chase, and was very dear to <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>. Fleeing from <prn id='Q23168'>Minos</prn>, who had fallen in love with her, she threw herself into nets which had been cast (aphemena) for a draught of fishes. She was made a goddess by <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, and she is worshipped, not only by the <pl id='Q4752820'>Cretans</pl>, but also by the <pl id='Q191082'>Aeginetans</pl>, who say that <prn id='Q831577'>Britomartis</prn> shows herself in their island. Her surname among the <pl id='Q191082'>Aeginetans</pl> is <prn id='Q618401'>Aphaea</prn>; in <pl id='Q4752820'>Crete</pl> it is <prn id='Q5805670'>Dictynna</prn> (Goddess of Nets). </p>
<p id='2.30.4'><b>2.30.4</b> The <pl id='Q2031433'>Panhellenion Mount</pl>, except for the <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <pl id='Q110302685'>sanctuary</pl>, has, I found, nothing else worthy of mention. This sanctuary, they say, was made for <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> by <prn id='Q206187'>Aeacus</prn>. The story of <prn id='Q21616290'>Auxesia</prn> and <prn id='Q1158425'>Damia</prn>, how the <pl id='Q233576'>Epidaurians</pl> suffered from drought, how in obedience to an oracle they had these wooden images made of olive wood that they received from the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, how the <pl id='Q233576'>Epidaurians</pl> left off paying to the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> what they had agreed to pay, on the ground that the <pl id='Q191082'>Aeginetans</pl> had the images, how the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> perished who crossed over to <pl id='Q191082'>Aegina</pl> to fetch them — all this, as <prn id='Q26825'>Herodotus</prn> has described it accurately and in detail, I have no intention of relating, because the story has been well told already; but I will add that I saw the images, and sacrificed to them in the same way as it is customary to sacrifice at <pl id='Q94299853'>Eleusis</pl>. </p>
<p id='2.30.5'><b>2.30.5</b> So much I must relate about <pl id='Q191082'>Aegina</pl>, for the sake of <prn id='Q206187'>Aeacus</prn> and his exploits. Bordering on <pl id='Q233576'>Epidauria</pl> are the <pl id='Q581494'>Troezenians</pl>, unrivalled glorifiers of their own country. They say that <prn id='Q110289833'>Orus</prn> was the first to be born in their land. Now, in my opinion, <prn id='Q110289833'>Orus</prn> is an <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptian</pl> name and utterly un-Greek; but they assert that he became their king, and that the land was called OraeaYY after him and that <prn id='Q4063102'>Althepus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> and of <prn id='Q106514537'>Leis</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q110289833'>Orus</prn>, inheriting the kingdom after <prn id='Q110289833'>Orus</prn>, named the land Althepia. </p>
<p id='2.30.6'><b>2.30.6</b> During his reign, they say, <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> and <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> disputed about the land, and after disputing held it in common, as <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> commanded them to do. For this reason they worship both <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, whom they name both <prn id='Q107090895'>Polias</prn> (Urban) and <prn id='Q107274853'>Sthenias</prn> (Strong), and also <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, under the surname of <prn id='Q56055088'>Basileus</prn> (king). And moreover their old coins have as device a trident and a face of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.30.7'><b>2.30.7</b> After <prn id='Q4063102'>Althepus</prn>, <prn id='Q4063102'>Saron</prn> became king. They said that this man built the sanctuary for <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> <prn id='Q107274893'>Saronis</prn> by a sea which is marshy and shallow, so that for this reason it was called the <prn id='Q2115813'>Phoebaean lagoon</prn>. Now <prn id='Q4063102'>Saron</prn> was very fond of hunting. As he was chasing a doe, it so chanced that it dashed into the sea and he dashed in alter it. The doe swam further and further from the shore, and <prn id='Q4063102'>Saron</prn> kept close to his prey, until his ardor brought him to the open ocean. Here his strength failed, and he was drowned in the waves. The body was cast ashore at the grove of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> by the <prn id='Q2115813'>Phoebaean lagoon</prn>, and they buried it within the sacred enclosure, and after him they named the sea in these parts the <pl id='Q211779'>Saronic</pl> instead of the <prn id='Q2115813'>Phoebaean lagoon</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.30.8'><b>2.30.8</b> They know nothing of the later kings down to <prn id='Q21548810'>Hyperes</prn> and <prn id='Q3618450'>Anthas</prn>. These they assert to be sons of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> and of <prn id='Q763268'>Alcyone</prn>, daughter of <prn id='Q130818'>Atlas</prn>, adding that they founded in the country the cities of HypereaYY and Anthea; <prn id='Q2825686'>Aetius</prn>, however, the son of <prn id='Q3618450'>Anthas</prn>, on inheriting the kingdoms of his father and of his uncle, named one of the cities Poseidonias. When <prn id='Q7844953'>Troezen</prn> and <prn id='Q750580'>Pittheus</prn> came to <prn id='Q2825686'>Aetius</prn> there were three kings instead of one, but the sons of <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn> enjoyed the balance of power. </p>
<p id='2.30.9'><b>2.30.9</b> Here is evidence of it. When <prn id='Q7844953'>Troezen</prn> died, <prn id='Q750580'>Pittheus</prn> gathered the inhabitants together, incorporating both HypereaYY and Anthea into the modern city, which he named <pl id='Q581494'>Troezen</pl> after his brother. Many years afterwards the descendants of <prn id='Q2825686'>Aetius</prn>, son of <prn id='Q3618450'>Anthas</prn>, were dispatched as colonists from <pl id='Q581494'>Troezen</pl>, and founded <pl id='Q5843680'>Halicarnassus</pl> and <pl id='Q18823111'>Myndus</pl> in <pl id='Q193214'>Caria</pl>. <prn id='Q110276324'>Anaphlystus</prn> and <prn id='Q110276336'>Sphettus</prn>, sons of <prn id='Q7844953'>Troezen</prn>, migrated to <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl>, and the demes [<pl id='Q13422911'>Anaphlystus</pl>, <pl id='Q13446048'>Sphettus</pl>] are named after them. As my readers know it already, I shall not relate the story of <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>, the grandson of <prn id='Q750580'>Pittheus</prn>. There is, however, one incident that I must add. </p>
<p id='2.30.10'><b>2.30.10</b> On the return of the <prn id='Q828084'>Heracleidae</prn>, the <pl id='Q581494'>Troezenians</pl> too received <prn id='Q203711'>Dorian</prn> settlers from <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>. They had been subject at even an earlier date to the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>; <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>, too, in the <prn id='Q1233048'>Catalogue</prn>, says that their commander was <prn id='Q208256'>Diomedes</prn>. For <prn id='Q208256'>Diomedes</prn> and <prn id='Q1378407'>Euryalus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q1968413'>Mecisteus</prn>, who were guardians of the boy <prn id='Q1444498'>Cyanippus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q10966726'>Aegialeus</prn>, led the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> to <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl>. <prn id='Q1060267'>Sthenelus</prn>, as I have related above, came of a more illustrious family, called the Anaxagoridae, and he had the best claim to the Kingdom of <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>. Such is the story of the <pl id='Q581494'>Troezenians</pl>, with the exception of the cities that claim to be their colonies. I will now proceed to describe the appointments of their sanctuaries and the remarkable sights of their country. </p>
<p id='2.31.1'><b>2.31.1</b> In the agora of <pl id='Q581494'>Troezen</pl> is a temple of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> <prn id='Q2303797'>Saviour</prn>, with images of the goddess. It was said that the temple was founded and the name <prn id='Q2303797'>Saviour</prn> given by <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> when he returned from <pl id='Q4752820'>Crete</pl> after overcoming <prn id='Q42372544'>Asterion</prn> the son of <prn id='Q23168'>Minos</prn>. This victory he considered the most noteworthy of his achievements, not so much, in my opinion, because <prn id='Q42372544'>Asterion</prn> was the bravest of those killed by <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>, but because his success in unravelling the difficult Maze and in escaping unnoticed after the exploit made credible the saying that it was divine providence that brought <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> and his company back in safety. </p>
<p id='2.31.2'><b>2.31.2</b> In this temple are altars to the gods said to rule under the earth. It is here that they say <prn id='Q776139'>Semele</prn> was brought out of Hades by <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>, and that <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> dragged up the <prn id='Q83496'>hound of Hades</prn>. But I cannot bring myself to believe even that <prn id='Q776139'>Semele</prn> died at all, seeing that she was the wife of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>; while, as for the so-called <prn id='Q83496'>hound of Hades</prn>, I will give my views in another place. </p>
<p id='2.31.3'><b>2.31.3</b> Behind the temple is the tomb of <prn id='Q750580'>Pittheus</prn>, on which are placed three seats of white marble. On them they say that <prn id='Q750580'>Pittheus</prn> and two men with him used to sit in judgment. Not far off is a sanctuary of the <prn id='Q66016'>Muses</prn>, made, they told me, by <prn id='Q3621840'>Ardalus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q44384'>Hephaestus</prn>. This <prn id='Q3621840'>Ardalus</prn> they hold to have invented the flute, and after him they name the <prn id='Q66016'>Muses</prn> <prn id='Q40139332'>Ardalides</prn>. Here, they say, <prn id='Q750580'>Pittheus</prn> taught the art of rhetoric, and I have myself read a book purporting to be a treatise by <prn id='Q750580'>Pittheus</prn>, published by a citizen of <pl id='Q233576'>Epidaurus</pl>. Not far from the <prn id='Q66016'>Muses</prn>' Hall is an old altar, which also, according to report, was dedicated by <prn id='Q3621840'>Ardalus</prn>. Upon it they sacrifice to the <prn id='Q66016'>Muses</prn> and to <prn id='Q189347'>Sleep</prn>, saying that <prn id='Q189347'>Sleep</prn> is the god that is dearest to the <prn id='Q66016'>Muses</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.31.4'><b>2.31.4</b> Near the theater a temple of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> <prn id='Q107349780'>Lyceia</prn> (Wolfish) was made by <prn id='Q338201'>Hippolytus</prn>. About this surname I could learn nothing from the local guides, but I gathered that either <prn id='Q338201'>Hippolytus</prn> destroyed <prn id='Q18498'>wolves</prn> that were ravaging the land of <pl id='Q581494'>Troezen</pl>, or else that <prn id='Q107349780'>Lyceia</prn> is a surname of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> among the <prn id='Q134154'>Amazons</prn>, from whom he was descended through his mother. Perhaps there may be another explanation that I am unaware of. The stone in front of the temple, called the Sacred Stone, they say is that on which nine men of <pl id='Q581494'>Troezen</pl> once purified <prn id='Q192407'>Orestes</prn> from the stain of matricide. </p>
<p id='2.31.5'><b>2.31.5</b> Not far from <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> <prn id='Q107349780'>Lyceia</prn> are altars close to one another. The first of them is to <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>, surnamed, in accordance with an oracle, <prn id='Q107248301'>Saotes</prn> (Saviour); the second is named the altar of the <prn id='Q10385917'>Themides</prn> (daughters of Themis), and was dedicated, they say, by <prn id='Q750580'>Pittheus</prn>. They had every reason, it seems to me, for making an altar to <prn id='Q134270'>Helius</prn> <prn id='Q106542644'>Eleutherios</prn> (Sun, God of Freedom), seeing that they escaped being enslaved by <prn id='Q129165'>Xerxes</prn> and the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl>. </p>
<p id='2.31.6'><b>2.31.6</b> The sanctuary of <prn id='Q107349781'>Thearian</prn> <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, they told me, was set up by <prn id='Q750580'>Pittheus</prn>; it is the oldest I know of. Now the <pl id='Q428732'>Phocaeans</pl>, too, in <pl id='Q620874'>Ionia</pl> have an old temple of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, which was once burnt by <prn id='Q462684'>Harpagus</prn> the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl>, and the <pl id='Q13580795'>Samians</pl> also have an old one of <prn id='Q107189402'>Pythian</prn> <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>; these, however, were built much later than the sanctuary at <pl id='Q581494'>Troezen</pl>. The modern image was dedicated by Auliscus, and made by <prn id='Q11925512'>Hermon</prn> of <pl id='Q581494'>Troezen</pl>. This <prn id='Q11925512'>Hermon</prn> made also the wooden images of the <prn id='Q190103'>Dioscuri</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.31.7'><b>2.31.7</b> Under a stoa in the agora are set up women; both they and their children are of stone. They are the women and children whom the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> gave to the <pl id='Q581494'>Troezenians</pl> to be kept safe, when they had resolved to evacuate <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> and not to await the attack of the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl> by land. They are said to have dedicated likenesses, not of all the women — for, as a matter of fact, the statues are not many — but only of those who were of high rank. </p>
<p id='2.31.8'><b>2.31.8</b> In front of the sanctuary of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> is a building called the Skene (booth) of <prn id='Q192407'>Orestes</prn>. For before he was cleansed for shedding his mother's blood, no citizen of <pl id='Q581494'>Troezen</pl> would receive him into his home; so they lodged him here and gave him entertainment while they cleansed him, until they had finished the purification. Down to the present day the descendants of those who cleansed <prn id='Q192407'>Orestes</prn> dine here on appointed days. A little way from the booth were buried, they say, the means of cleansing, and from them grew up a bay tree, which, indeed, still remains, being the one before this booth. </p>
<p id='2.31.9'><b>2.31.9</b> Among the means of cleansing which they say they used to cleanse <prn id='Q192407'>Orestes</prn> was water from <pl id='Q195848'>Hippocrene</pl> for the <pl id='Q581494'>Troezenians</pl> too have a fountain called the <prn id='Q726'>Horse</prn>'s, and the legend about it does not differ from the one which prevails in <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl>. For they, too, say that the earth sent up the water when the <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn> <prn id='Q162797'>Pegasus</prn> struck the ground with his hoof, and that <prn id='Q189872'>Bellerophontes</prn> came to <pl id='Q581494'>Troezen</pl> to ask <prn id='Q750580'>Pittheus</prn> to give him <prn id='Q11921121'>Aethra</prn> to wife, but before the marriage took place he was banished from <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl>. </p>
<p id='2.31.10'><b>2.31.10</b> Here there is also a <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> called <prn id='Q107349779'>Polygius</prn>. Against this image, they say, <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> leaned his club. Now this club, which was of wild olive, taking root in the earth (if anyone cares to believe the story), grew up again and is still alive; <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, they say, discovering the wild olive by the <pl id='Q211779'>Saronic</pl> Sea, cut a club from it. There is also a sanctuary of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> surnamed <prn id='Q2303797'>Saviour</prn>, which, they say, was made by <prn id='Q2825686'>Aetius</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q3618450'>Anthas</prn>, when he was king. To a water they give the name Chrysoroa (River of Gold). They say that when the land was afflicted with a drought for nine years, during which no rain fell, all the other waters dried up, but this River of Gold even then continued to flow as before. </p>
<p id='2.32.1'><b>2.32.1</b> To <prn id='Q338201'>Hippolytus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>, is devoted a very famous precinct, in which is a temple with an old image. <prn id='Q208256'>Diomedes</prn>, they say, made these, and, moreover, was the first to sacrifice to <prn id='Q338201'>Hippolytus</prn>. The <pl id='Q581494'>Troezenians</pl> have a priest of <prn id='Q338201'>Hippolytus</prn>, who holds his sacred office for life, and annual sacrifices have been established. They also observe the following custom. Every maiden before marriage cuts off a lock for <prn id='Q338201'>Hippolytus</prn>, and, having cut it, she brings it to the temple and dedicates it. They will not have it that he was dragged to death by his <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn>, and, though they know his grave, they do not show it. But they believe that what is called the Charioteer in the sky is the <prn id='Q338201'>Hippolytus</prn> of the legend, such being the honor he enjoys from the gods. </p>
<p id='2.32.2'><b>2.32.2</b> Within this enclosure is a temple of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> <prn id='Q60467719'>Epibaterios</prn> (Seafaring), an offering of <prn id='Q208256'>Diomedes</prn> for having weathered the storm that came upon the Greeks as they were returning from <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl>. They say that <prn id='Q208256'>Diomedes</prn> was also the first to hold the <prn id='Q649128'>Pythian games</prn> in honor of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>. Of <prn id='Q1158425'>Damia</prn> and <prn id='Q21616290'>Auxesia</prn> (for the <pl id='Q581494'>Troezenians</pl>, too, share in their worship) they do not give the same account as the <pl id='Q233576'>Epidaurians</pl> and <pl id='Q191082'>Aeginetans</pl>, but say that they were maidens who came from <pl id='Q4752820'>Crete</pl>. A general insurrection having arisen in the city, these too, they say, were stoned to death by the opposite party; and they hold a festival in their honor that they call <prn id='Q115708271'>Lithobolia</prn> (Stoning). </p>
<p id='2.32.3'><b>2.32.3</b> In the other part of the enclosure is a race-course called that of <prn id='Q338201'>Hippolytus</prn>, and above it a temple of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> <prn id='Q107349782'>Kataskopia</prn> (Spy). For from here, whenever <prn id='Q338201'>Hippolytus</prn> practised his exercises, <prn id='Q212818'>Phaedra</prn>, who was in love with him, used to gaze upon him. Here there still grew the myrtle, with its leaves, as I have described above, pierced with holes. When <prn id='Q212818'>Phaedra</prn> was in despair and could find no relief for her passion, she used to vent her spleen upon the leaves of this myrtle. </p>
<p id='2.32.4'><b>2.32.4</b> There is also the grave of <prn id='Q212818'>Phaedra</prn>, not far from the tomb of <prn id='Q338201'>Hippolytus</prn>, which is a barrow near the myrtle. The image of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> was made by <prn id='Q1342534'>Timotheus</prn>, but the <pl id='Q581494'>Troezenians</pl> say that it is not <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>, but a likeness of <prn id='Q338201'>Hippolytus</prn>. I remember, too, seeing the house of <prn id='Q338201'>Hippolytus</prn>; before it is what is called the Fountain of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, for <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, say the <pl id='Q581494'>Troezenians</pl>, discovered the water. </p>
<p id='2.32.5'><b>2.32.5</b> On the acropolis is a temple of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, called <prn id='Q107274853'>Sthenias</prn>. The <prn id='Q693222'>xoanon</prn> itself of the goddess was made by <prn id='Q1722514'>Callon</prn>, of <pl id='Q191082'>Aegina</pl>. <prn id='Q1722514'>Callon</prn> was a pupil of <prn id='Q11951091'>Tectaeus</prn> and <prn id='Q3616838'>Angelion</prn>, who made the image of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> for the <pl id='Q173148'>Delians</pl>. <prn id='Q3616838'>Angelion</prn> and <prn id='Q11951091'>Tectaeus</prn> were trained in the school of <prn id='Q15806048'>Dipoenus</prn> and <prn id='Q19999327'>Scyllis</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.32.6'><b>2.32.6</b> On going down from here you come to a sanctuary of <prn id='Q132582'>Pan</prn> <prn id='Q107349784'>Lyterius</prn> (Releasing), so named because he showed to the <pl id='Q581494'>Troezenian</pl> magistrates dreams which supplied a cure for the epidemic that had afflicted <pl id='Q581494'>Troezenia</pl>, and the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> more than any other people. Having crossed the sanctuary, you can see a temple of <prn id='Q79876'>Isis</prn>, and above it one of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> <prn id='Q420733'>Akraia</prn> (of the promontory). The temple was made by the <pl id='Q5843680'>Halicarnassians</pl> in <pl id='Q581494'>Troezen</pl>, because this is their mother-city, but the image of <prn id='Q79876'>Isis</prn> was dedicated by the people of <pl id='Q581494'>Troezen</pl>. </p>
<p id='2.32.7'><b>2.32.7</b> On the road that leads through the mountains to <pl id='Q58401924'>Hermione</pl> is a spring of the river Hyllicus, originally called Taurius (Bull-like), and a rock called the Rock of <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>; when <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> took up the boots and sword of <prn id='Q191725'>Aegeus</prn> under it, it, too, changed its name, for before it was called the altar of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q107271186'>Sthenius</prn> (Strong). Near the rock is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> <prn id='Q107276375'>Nymphia</prn> (Bridal), made by <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> when he took <prn id='Q164061'>Helen</prn> to wife. </p>
<p id='2.32.8'><b>2.32.8</b> Outside the wall there is also a sanctuary of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> <prn id='Q107276277'>Phytalmios</prn> (Nurturer). For they say that, being wroth with them, <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> smote the land with barrenness, brine (halme) reaching the seeds and the roots of the plants (phyta), until, appeased by sacrifices and prayers, he ceased to send up the brine upon the earth. Above the temple of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> is <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> <prn id='Q2401559'>Thesmophoros</prn> (Lawbringer), set up, they say, by <prn id='Q4063102'>Althepus</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.32.9'><b>2.32.9</b> On going down to the harbor at what is called Celenderis, you come to a place called Birthplace (Genethlion), where <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> is said to have been born. Before this place is a temple of <prn id='Q40901'>Ares</prn>, for here also did <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> conquer the <prn id='Q134154'>Amazons</prn> in battle. These must have belonged to the army that strove in <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl> against <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> and the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>. </p>
<p id='2.32.10'><b>2.32.10</b> As you make your way to the Psiphaean Sea you see a wild olive growing, which they call the Bent Rhacos. The <pl id='Q581494'>Troezenians</pl> call rhacos every kind of barren olive — cotinos, phylia, or elaios — and this tree they call Bent because it was when the reins caught in it that the chariot of <prn id='Q338201'>Hippolytus</prn> was upset. Not far from this stands the sanctuary of <prn id='Q107274893'>Saronian</prn> <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, and I have already given an account of it. I must add that every year they hold in honor of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> a festival called Saronia. </p>
<p id='2.33.1'><b>2.33.1</b> The <pl id='Q581494'>Troezenians</pl> possess islands, one of which is near the mainland, and it is possible to wade across the channel. This was formerly called <pl id='Q60791476'>Sphaeria</pl>, but its name was changed to Sacred Island for the following reason. In it is the tomb of <prn id='Q2311453'>Sphaerus</prn>, who, they say, was charioteer to <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn>. In obedience forsooth to a dream from <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, <prn id='Q11921121'>Aethra</prn> crossed over into the island with libations for <prn id='Q2311453'>Sphaerus</prn>. After she had crossed, <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> is said to have had intercourse with her here. So for this reason <prn id='Q11921121'>Aethra</prn> set up here a temple of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> <prn id='Q2734384'>Apaturia</prn>, and changed the name from <pl id='Q60791476'>Sphaeria</pl> to Sacred Island. She also established a custom for the <pl id='Q581494'>Troezenian</pl> maidens of dedicating their girdles before wedlock to <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> <prn id='Q2734384'>Apaturia</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.33.2'><b>2.33.2</b> <pl id='Q38281326'>Calaurea</pl>, they say, was sacred to <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> of old, at the time when <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> was sacred to <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>. Legend adds that the two gods exchanged the two places. They still say this, and quote an oracle: “<pl id='Q106802906'>Delos</pl> and <pl id='Q38281326'>Calaurea</pl> alike thou lovest to dwell in, <pl id='Q682558'>Pytho</pl>, too, the holy, and <pl id='Q33119266'>Taenarum</pl> swept by the high winds.” At any rate, there is a holy sanctuary of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> here, and it is served by a maiden priestess until she reaches an age fit for marriage. </p>
<p id='2.33.3'><b>2.33.3</b> Within the enclosure is also the tomb of <prn id='Q117253'>Demosthenes</prn>. His fate, and that of <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> before him, have, in my opinion, showed most plainly how spiteful the deity is; for <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>, after losing his sight, was, in addition to this great affliction, cursed with a second — a poverty which drove him in beggary to every land; while to <prn id='Q117253'>Demosthenes</prn> it befell to experience exile in his old age and to meet with such a violent end. Now, although concerning him, not only others, but <prn id='Q117253'>Demosthenes</prn> himself, have again and again declared that assuredly he took no part of the money that <prn id='Q462994'>Harpalus</prn> brought from <prn id='Q48'>Asia</prn>, </p>
<p id='2.33.4'><b>2.33.4</b> yet I must relate the circumstances of the statement made subsequently. Shortly after <prn id='Q462994'>Harpalus</prn> ran away from <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> and crossed with a squadron to <pl id='Q4752820'>Crete</pl>, he was put to death by the servants who were attending him, though some assert that he was assassinated by PausaniasYY, a <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonian</pl>. The steward of his money fled to <pl id='Q13533316'>Rhodes</pl>, and was arrested by a <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonian</pl>, <prn id='Q74782'>Philoxenus</prn>, who also had demanded <prn id='Q462994'>Harpalus</prn> from the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>. Having this slave in his power, he proceeded to examine him, until he learned everything about such as had allowed themselves to accept a bribe from <prn id='Q462994'>Harpalus</prn>. On obtaining this information he sent a dispatch to <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, </p>
<p id='2.33.5'><b>2.33.5</b> in which he gave a list of such as had taken a bribe from <prn id='Q462994'>Harpalus</prn>, both their names and the sums each had received. <prn id='Q117253'>Demosthenes</prn>, however, he never mentioned at all, although <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn> held him in bitter hatred, and he himself had a private quarrel with him. So <prn id='Q117253'>Demosthenes</prn> is honored in many parts of Greece, and especially by the dwellers in <pl id='Q38281326'>Calaurea</pl>. </p>
<p id='2.34.1'><b>2.34.1</b> Stretching out far into the sea from <pl id='Q581494'>Troezenia</pl> is a peninsula, on the coast of which has been founded a little town called <pl id='Q107472458'>Methana</pl>. Here there is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q79876'>Isis</prn>, and on the agora is an image of <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn>, and also one of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>. Some thirty stades distant from the town are hot baths. They say that it was when <prn id='Q241386'>Antigonus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q59734'>Demetrius</prn>, was king of <pl id='Q81734'>Macedon</pl> that the water first appeared, and that what appeared at once was not water, but fire that gushed in great volume from the ground, and when this died down the water flowed; indeed, even at the present day it wells up hot and exceedingly salt. A bather here finds no cold water at hand, and if he dives into the sea his swim is full of danger. For wild creatures live in it, and it swarms with <prn id='Q7372'>sharks</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.34.2'><b>2.34.2</b> I will also relate what astonished me most in <pl id='Q107472458'>Methana</pl>. The wind called <prn id='Q1740184'>Lips</prn>, striking the budding vines from the <pl id='Q211779'>Saronic Gulf</pl>, blights their buds. So while the wind is still rushing on, two men cut in two a cock whose feathers are all white, and run round the vines in opposite directions, each carrying half of the cock. When they meet at their starting place, they bury the pieces there. </p>
<p id='2.34.3'><b>2.34.3</b> Such are the means they have devised against the <prn id='Q1740184'>Lips</prn>. The islets, nine in number, lying off the land are called the <prn id='Q115623723'>Isles of Pelops</prn>, and they say that when it rains one of them is not touched. If this be the case I do not know, though the people around <pl id='Q107472458'>Methana</pl> said that it was true, and I have seen before now men trying to keep off hail by sacrifices and spells. </p>
<p id='2.34.4'><b>2.34.4</b> <pl id='Q107472458'>Methana</pl>, then, is a peninsula of the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl>. Within it, bordering on the land of <pl id='Q581494'>Troezen</pl>, is <pl id='Q58401924'>Hermione</pl>. The founder of the old city, the <pl id='Q58401924'>Hermionians</pl> say, was <prn id='Q2887338'>Hermion</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q1377131'>Europs</prn>. Now <prn id='Q1377131'>Europs</prn>, whose father was certainly <prn id='Q649624'>Phoroneus</prn>, <prn id='Q115623870'>Herophanes</prn> of <pl id='Q581494'>Troezen</pl> said was an illegitimate child. For surely the kingdom of <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> would never have devolved upon <prn id='Q649476'>Argus</prn>, <prn id='Q213621'>Niobe</prn>'s son, the grandchild of <prn id='Q649624'>Phoroneus</prn>, in the presence of a legitimate son. </p>
<p id='2.34.5'><b>2.34.5</b> But even supposing that <prn id='Q1377131'>Europs</prn> was a legitimate child who died before <prn id='Q649624'>Phoroneus</prn>, I am quite sure that his son was not likely to stand a fair chance against <prn id='Q213621'>Niobe</prn>'s child, whose father was supposed to be <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>. Subsequently the <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn> from <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> settled, among other places, at <pl id='Q58401924'>Hermion</pl>, but I do not think there was war between the two peoples, or it would have been spoken of by the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>. </p>
<p id='2.34.6'><b>2.34.6</b> There is a road from <pl id='Q581494'>Troezen</pl> to <pl id='Q58401924'>Hermion</pl> by way of the rock which aforetime was called the altar of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q107271186'>Sthenius</prn> (Strong) but afterwards <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> took up the tokens, and people now call it the Rock of <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>. As you go, then, along a mountain road by way of this rock, you reach a temple of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> surnamed Platanistius (God of the Plane-tree Grove), and a place called <pl id='Q118744800'>Eilei</pl>, where are sanctuaries of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> and of her daughter <prn id='Q45967'>Core</prn> (Maid). Seawards, on the borders of HermionisYY, is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> surnamed <prn id='Q107271157'>Thermasia</prn> (Warmth). </p>
<p id='2.34.7'><b>2.34.7</b> Just about eighty stades away is a headland <pl id='Q24924372'>Scyllaeum</pl>, which is named after the <prn id='Q1415180'>daughter</prn> of <prn id='Q1136201'>Nisus</prn>. For when, owing to her treachery, <prn id='Q23168'>Minos</prn> had taken <pl id='Q2537089'>Nisaea</pl> and <pl id='Q42307600'>Megara</pl>, he said that now he would not have her to wife, and ordered his <pl id='Q4752820'>Cretans</pl> to throw her from the ship. She was drowned, and the waves cast up her body on this headland. They do not show a grave of her, but say that the sea birds were allowed to tear the corpse to pieces. </p>
<p id='2.34.8'><b>2.34.8</b> As you sail from <pl id='Q24924372'>Scyllaeum</pl> in the direction of the city, you reach another headland, called Bucephala (Ox-head), and, after the headland, islands, the first of which is Haliussa (Salt Island). This provides a harbor where there is good anchorage. After it comes <pl id='Q368275'>Pityussa</pl> (Pine Island), and the third they call Aristerae. On sailing past these you come to another headland, <pl id='Q25117391'>Colyergia</pl>, jutting out from the mainland, and after it to an island, called <pl id='Q16523372'>Tricrana</pl> (Three Heads), and a mountain, projecting into the sea from the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl>, called <pl id='Q25016594'>Buporthmus</pl> (Ox-ford). On <pl id='Q25016594'>Buporthmus</pl> has been built a sanctuary of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> and her daughter, as well as one of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, surnamed <prn id='Q107274786'>Promachorma</prn> (Champion of the Anchorage). </p>
<p id='2.34.9'><b>2.34.9</b> Before <pl id='Q25016594'>Buporthmus</pl> lies an island called <pl id='Q1140015'>Aperopia</pl>, not far from which is another island, <pl id='Q208319'>Hydrea</pl>. After it the mainland is skirted by a crescent-shaped beach and after the beach there is a spit of land up to a sanctuary of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, beginning at the sea on the east and extending westwards. It possesses harbors, and is some seven stades in length, and not more than three stades in breadth where it is broadest. </p>
<p id='2.34.10'><b>2.34.10</b> Here the <pl id='Q58401924'>Hermionians</pl> had their former city. They still have sanctuaries here: one of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> at the east end of the spit, and a temple of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> further inland; by the side of the latter are the foundations of a race-course, in which legend says the sons of <prn id='Q192946'>Tyndareus</prn> contended. There is also another sanctuary of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, of no great size, the roof of which has fallen in. There is a temple to <prn id='Q134270'>Helius</prn> (Sun), another to the <prn id='Q184353'>Graces</prn>, and a third to <prn id='Q214554'>Serapis</prn> and <prn id='Q79876'>Isis</prn>. There are also circuits of large unhewn stones, within which they perform mystic ritual to <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.34.11'><b>2.34.11</b> Such are the possessions of the <pl id='Q58401924'>Hermionians</pl> in these parts. The modern city is just about four stades distant from the headland, upon which is the sanctuary of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, and it lies on a site which is level at first, gently rising up a slope, which presently merges into <pl id='Q115795907'>Pron</pl>, for so they name this mountain. A wall stands all round <pl id='Q58401924'>Hermione</pl>, a city which I found afforded much to write about, and among the things which I thought I myself must certainly mention are a temple of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>, surnamed both Pontia (of the Deep Sea) and <prn id='Q107271066'>Limenia</prn> (of the Harbor), and a white-marble image of huge size, and worth seeing for its artistic excellence. </p>
<p id='2.34.12'><b>2.34.12</b> There is also another temple of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>. Among the honors paid her by the <pl id='Q58401924'>Hermionians</pl> is this custom: maidens, and widows about to remarry, all sacrifice to her before wedding. Sanctuaries have also been built of Demeter Thermasia (Warmth), one at the border towards <pl id='Q581494'>Troezenia</pl>, as I have stated above, while there is another in <pl id='Q58401924'>Hermione</pl> itself. </p>
<p id='2.35.1'><b>2.35.1</b> Near the latter is a temple of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> of the Black Goatskin. In his honor every year they hold a competition in music, and they offer prizes for swimming-races and boat-races. There is also a sanctuary of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> surnamed <prn id='Q107271224'>Iphigenia</prn>, and a bronze <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> with one foot upon a <prn id='Q7369'>dolphin</prn>. Passing by this into the sanctuary of <prn id='Q41419'>Hestia</prn>, we see no image, but only an altar, and they sacrifice to <prn id='Q41419'>Hestia</prn> upon it. </p>
<p id='2.35.2'><b>2.35.2</b> Of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> there are three temples and three images. One has no surname; the second they call <prn id='Q107248263'>Pythaeus</prn>, and the third <prn id='Q107271273'>Horios</prn> (of the Borders). The name <prn id='Q107248263'>Pythaeus</prn> they have learned from the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>, for <prn id='Q287216'>Telesilla</prn> tells us that they were the first Greeks to whose country came <prn id='Q109802111'>Pythaeus</prn>, who was a son of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>. I cannot say for certain why they call the third <prn id='Q107271273'>Horios</prn>, but I conjecture that they won a victory, either in war or by arbitration, in a dispute concerning the borders (horoi) of their land, and for this reason paid honors to <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> <prn id='Q107271273'>Horios</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.35.3'><b>2.35.3</b> The sanctuary of <prn id='Q213440'>Fortune</prn> is said by the <pl id='Q58401924'>Hermionians</pl> to be the newest in their city; a colossus of <pl id='Q65040323'>Parian</pl> marble stands there. Of their wells, one is very old; nobody can see the water flowing into it, but it would never run dry, even if everybody descended and drew water from it. Another well they made in our own day, and the name of the place from which the water flows into it is LeimonYY (Meadow). </p>
<p id='2.35.4'><b>2.35.4</b> The object most worthy of mention is a <pl id='Q115806034'>sanctuary</pl> of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> on <pl id='Q115795907'>Pron</pl>. This sanctuary is said by the <pl id='Q58401924'>Hermionians</pl> to have been founded by <prn id='Q58316648'>Clymenus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q649624'>Phoroneus</prn>, and <prn id='Q1088972'>Chthonia</prn>, sister of <prn id='Q58316648'>Clymenus</prn>. But the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl> account is that when <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> came to <pl id='Q12649101'>Argolis</pl>, while <prn id='Q55957981'>Atheras</prn> and <prn id='Q6948683'>Mysius</prn> afforded hospitality to the goddess, <prn id='Q115623962'>Colontas</prn> neither received her into his home nor paid her any other mark of respect. His daughter <prn id='Q1088972'>Chthonia</prn> disapproved of this conduct. They say that <prn id='Q115623962'>Colontas</prn> was punished by being burnt up along with his house, while <prn id='Q1088972'>Chthonia</prn> was brought to <pl id='Q58401924'>Hermion</pl> by <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>, and made the sanctuary for the <pl id='Q58401924'>Hermionians</pl>. </p>
<p id='2.35.5'><b>2.35.5</b> At any rate, the goddess herself is called <prn id='Q57444528'>Chthonia</prn>, and <prn id='Q11916249'>Chthonia</prn> is the name of the festival they hold in the summer of every year. The manner of it is this. The procession is headed by the priests of the gods and by all those who hold the annual magistracies; these are followed by both men and women. It is now a custom that some who are still children should honor the goddess in the procession. These are dressed in white, and wear wreaths upon their heads. Their wreaths are woven of the flower called by the natives cosmosandalon, which, from its size and color, seems to me to be an iris; it even has inscribed upon it the same letters of mourning. </p>
<p id='2.35.6'><b>2.35.6</b> Those who form the procession are followed by men leading from the herd a full-grown <prn id='Q830'>cow</prn>, fastened with ropes, and still untamed and frisky. Having driven the <prn id='Q830'>cow</prn> to the <pl id='Q115806034'>temple</pl>, some loose her from the ropes that she may rush into the sanctuary, others, who hitherto have been holding the doors open, when they see the <prn id='Q830'>cow</prn> within the temple, close the doors. </p>
<p id='2.35.7'><b>2.35.7</b> Four old women, left behind inside, are they who dispatch the <prn id='Q830'>cow</prn>. Whichever gets the chance cuts the throat of the <prn id='Q830'>cow</prn> with a sickle. Afterwards the doors are opened, and those who are appointed drive up a second <prn id='Q830'>cow</prn>, and a third after that, and yet a fourth. All are dispatched in the same way by the old women, and the sacrifice has yet another strange feature. On whichever of her sides the first <prn id='Q830'>cow</prn> falls, all the others must fall on the same. </p>
<p id='2.35.8'><b>2.35.8</b> Such is the manner in which the sacrifice is performed by the <pl id='Q58401924'>Hermionians</pl>. Before the <pl id='Q115806034'>temple</pl> stand a few statues of the women who have served <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> as her priestess, and on passing inside you see seats on which the old women wait for the <prn id='Q830'>cows</prn> to be driven in one by one, and images, of no great age, of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> and <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>. But the thing itself that they worship more than all else, I never saw, nor yet has any other man, whether stranger or <pl id='Q58401924'>Hermionian</pl>. The old women may keep their knowledge of its nature to themselves. </p>
<p id='2.35.9'><b>2.35.9</b> There is also another temple, all round which stand statues. This temple is right opposite that of <prn id='Q1088972'>Chthonia</prn>, and is called that of <prn id='Q107272974'>Clymenus</prn>, and they sacrifice to <prn id='Q107272974'>Clymenus</prn> here. I do not believe that Clymenus was an <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl> who came to <pl id='Q58401924'>Hermion</pl> “<prn id='Q107272974'>Clymenus</prn>” is the surname of the god, whoever legend says is king in the underworld. </p>
<p id='2.35.10'><b>2.35.10</b> Beside this temple is another; it is of <prn id='Q40901'>Ares</prn>, and has an image of the god, while to the right of the <pl id='Q115806034'>sanctuary</pl> of <prn id='Q1088972'>Chthonia</prn> is a portico, called by the natives the Stoa of <prn id='Q207368'>Echo</prn>. It is such that if a man speaks it reverberates at least three times. Behind the <pl id='Q115806034'>temple</pl> of <prn id='Q1088972'>Chthonia</prn> are three places, which the <pl id='Q58401924'>Hermionians</pl> call that of <prn id='Q107272974'>Clymenus</prn>, that of <prn id='Q152262'>Plouton</prn>, and the Acherusian Lake. All are surrounded by fences of stones, while in the place of <prn id='Q107272974'>Clymenus</prn> there is also a chasm in the earth. Through this, according to the legend of the <pl id='Q58401924'>Hermionians</pl>, <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> brought up the <prn id='Q83496'>hound of Hades</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.35.11'><b>2.35.11</b> At the gate through which there is a straight road leading to <pl id='Q3561276'>Mases</pl>, there is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q94066'>Eileithyia</prn> within the wall. Every day, both with sacrifices and with incense, they magnificently propitiate the goddess, and, moreover, there is a vast number of votive gifts offered to <prn id='Q94066'>Eileithyia</prn>. But the image no one may see, except, perhaps, the priestesses. </p>
<p id='2.36.1'><b>2.36.1</b> Proceeding about seven stades along the straight road to <pl id='Q3561276'>Mases</pl>, you reach, on turning to the left, a road to <pl id='Q1571046'>Halice</pl>. At the present day <pl id='Q1571046'>Halice</pl> is deserted, but once it, too, had inhabitants, and there is mention made of citizens of <pl id='Q1571046'>Halice</pl> on the <pl id='Q233576'>Epidaurian</pl> slabs on which are inscribed the cures of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>. I know, however, no other authentic document in which mention is made either of the city <pl id='Q1571046'>Halice</pl> or of its citizens. Well, to this city also there is a road, which lies midway between <pl id='Q115795907'>Pron</pl> and another mountain, called in old days <pl id='Q115808938'>Thornax</pl>; but they say that the name was changed because, according to legend, it was here that the transformation of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> into a cuckoo took place. </p>
<p id='2.36.2'><b>2.36.2</b> Even to the present day there are sanctuaries on the tops of the mountains: on <pl id='Q115808938'>Mount Kokkygion</pl> (Cuckoo) one of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, on <pl id='Q115795907'>Pron</pl> one of <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn>. At the foot of <pl id='Q115808938'>Mount Kokkygion</pl> is a temple, but there are no doors standing, and I found it without a roof or an image inside. The temple was said to be <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>'s. By the side of it runs a road to <pl id='Q3561276'>Mases</pl> for those who have turned aside from the straight road. <pl id='Q3561276'>Mases</pl> was in old days a city, even as <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> represents it in the <prn id='Q1233048'>Catalogue</prn> of the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>, but in my time the <pl id='Q58401924'>Hermionians</pl> were using it as a seaport. </p>
<p id='2.36.3'><b>2.36.3</b> From <pl id='Q3561276'>Mases</pl> there is a road on the right to a headland called Struthus (Sparrow Peak). From this headland by way of the summits of the mountains the distance to the place called Philanorium and to the BoleoiYY is two hundred and fifty stades. These BoleoiYY are heaps of unhewn stones. Another place, called Didymoi (Twins), is twenty stades distant from here. There is here a sanctuary of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, a sanctuary of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, and in addition one of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>. The images are of white marble, and are upright. </p>
<p id='2.36.4'><b>2.36.4</b> Next comes a district, belonging to the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>, that once was called Asinaea, and by the sea are ruins of <pl id='Q1154474'>Asine</pl>. When the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> and their king <prn id='Q2537646'>Nicander</prn>, son of <prn id='Q176022'>Charillus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q2628781'>Polydectes</prn>, son of <prn id='Q2714687'>Eunomus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q2537664'>Prytanis</prn>, son of <prn id='Q1266363'>Eurypon</prn>, invaded <pl id='Q12649101'>Argolis</pl> with an army, the <pl id='Q1154474'>Asinaeans</pl> joined in the invasion, and with them ravaged the land of the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>. When the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> expedition departed home, the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> under their king <prn id='Q13408563'>Eratus</prn> attacked <pl id='Q1154474'>Asine</pl>. </p>
<p id='2.36.5'><b>2.36.5</b> For a time the <pl id='Q1154474'>Asinaeans</pl> defended themselves from their wall, and killed among others <prn id='Q115626322'>Lysistratus</prn>, one of the most notable men of <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>. But when the wall was lost, the citizens put their wives and children on board their vessels and abandoned their own country; the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>, while levelling <pl id='Q1154474'>Asine</pl> to the ground and annexing its territory to their own, left the sanctuary of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> <prn id='Q107248263'>Pythaeus</prn>, which is still visible, and by it they buried <prn id='Q115626322'>Lysistratus</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.36.6'><b>2.36.6</b> Distant from <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> forty stades and no more is the sea at <pl id='Q1236078'>Lerna</pl>. On the way down to <pl id='Q1236078'>Lerna</pl> the first thing on the road is the <pl id='Q12877267'>Erasinus</pl>, which empties itself into the <prn id='Q743482'>Phrixus</prn>, and the <prn id='Q743482'>Phrixus</prn> into the sea between <pl id='Q12160445'>Temenium</pl> and <pl id='Q1236078'>Lerna</pl>. About eight stades to the left from the <pl id='Q12877267'>Erasinus</pl> is a sanctuary of the Lords <prn id='Q190103'>Dioscuri</prn> (Sons of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>). Their wooden images have been made similar to those in the city. </p>
<p id='2.36.7'><b>2.36.7</b> On returning to the straight road, you will cross the <pl id='Q12877267'>Erasinus</pl> and reach the river Cheimarrus (Winter-torrent). Near it is a circuit of stones, and they say that <prn id='Q152262'>Plouton</prn>, after carrying off, according to the story, <prn id='Q45967'>Core</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>, descended here to his fabled kingdom underground. <pl id='Q1236078'>Lerna</pl> is, I have already stated, by the sea, and here they celebrate mysteries in honor of <pl id='Q1236078'>Lernaean</pl> <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.36.8'><b>2.36.8</b> There is a sacred grove beginning on the mountain they call Pontinus. Now Mount Pontinus does not let the rain-water flow away, but absorbs it into itself. From it flows a river, also called Pontinus. Upon the top of the mountain is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> <prn id='Q107273181'>Saitis</prn>, now merely a ruin; there are also the foundations of a house of <prn id='Q976463'>Hippomedon</prn>, who went to <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> to redress the wrongs of <prn id='Q334817'>Polyneices</prn>, son of <prn id='Q130890'>Oedipus</prn>. </p>
<p id='2.37.1'><b>2.37.1</b> At this mountain begins the grove, which consists chiefly of plane trees, and reaches down to the sea. Its boundaries are, on the one side the river Pontinus, on the other side another river, called Amymone, after the <prn id='Q482096'>daughter</prn> of <prn id='Q210883'>Danaus</prn>. Within the grove are statues of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> Prosymna and of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>. Of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> the seated statue is of no great size. </p>
<p id='2.37.2'><b>2.37.2</b> Both are of stone, but elsewhere in a temple is a seated <prn id='Q693222'>xoanon</prn> (wooden image) of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> <prn id='Q107248301'>Saotes</prn>, and a stone statue of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> on the sea. They say that the daughters of <prn id='Q210883'>Danaus</prn> dedicated it, while <prn id='Q210883'>Danaus</prn> himself made the sanctuary of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> on Pontinus. The mysteries of the <pl id='Q1236078'>Lernaeans</pl> were established, they say, by <prn id='Q53606'>Philammon</prn>. Now the words which accompany the ritual are evidently of no antiquity </p>
<p id='2.37.3'><b>2.37.3</b> and the inscription also, which I have heard is written on the heart made of orichalcum, was shown not to be <prn id='Q53606'>Philammon</prn>'s by <prn id='Q115769307'>Arriphon</prn>, an <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolian</pl> of <pl id='Q59735737'>Triconium</pl> by descent, who now enjoys a reputation second to none among the <pl id='Q18927'>Lycians</pl>; excellent at original research, he found the clue to this problem in the following way: the verses, and the prose interspersed among the verses, are all written in <prn id='Q285494'>Doric</prn>. But before the return of the <prn id='Q828084'>Heracleidae</prn> to the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl> the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> spoke the same dialect as the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, and in <prn id='Q53606'>Philammon</prn>'s day I do not suppose that even the name <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn> was familiar to all Greek ears. </p>
<p id='2.37.4'><b>2.37.4</b> All this was proved in the demonstration. At the source of the <prn id='Q482096'>Amymone</prn> grows a plane tree, beneath which, they say, the <prn id='Q170379'>Hydra</prn> (water-snake) grew. I am ready to believe that this beast was superior in size to other water-<prn id='Q2102'>snakes</prn>, and that its poison had something in it so deadly that <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> treated the points of his arrows with its gall. It had, however, in my opinion, one head, and not several. It was <prn id='Q1233081'>Peisander</prn> of <pl id='Q1231539'>Camirus</pl> who, in order that the beast might appear more frightful and his poetry might be more remarkable, represented the <prn id='Q170379'>Hydra</prn> with its many heads. </p>
<p id='2.37.5'><b>2.37.5</b> I saw also what is called the Spring of <prn id='Q330584'>Amphiaraus</prn> and the <prn id='Q115769195'>Alcyonian Lake</prn>, through which the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> say <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> went down to <pl id='Q1521549'>Hades</pl> to bring up <prn id='Q776139'>Semele</prn>, adding that the descent here was shown him by <prn id='Q1996285'>Polymnus</prn>. There is no limit to the depth of the <prn id='Q115769195'>Alcyonian Lake</prn>, and I know of nobody who by any contrivance has been able to reach the bottom of it since not even <prn id='Q1413'>Nero</prn>, who had ropes made several stades long and fastened them together, tying lead to them, and omitting nothing that might help his experiment, was able to discover any limit to its depth. </p>
<p id='2.37.6'><b>2.37.6</b> This, too, I heard. The water of the <prn id='Q115769195'>lake</prn> is, to all appearance, calm and quiet but, although it is such to look at, every swimmer who ventures to cross it is dragged down, sucked into the depths, and swept away. The circumference of the lake is not great, being about one-third of a stade. Upon its banks grow grass and rushes. The nocturnal rites performed every year in honor of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> I must not divulge to the world at large. </p>
<p id='2.38.1'><b>2.38.1</b> <pl id='Q12160445'>Temenium</pl> is in <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl> territory, and was named after <prn id='Q636796'>Temenus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q311536'>Aristomachus</prn>. For, having seized and strengthened the position, he waged therefrom with the <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn> the war against <prn id='Q2803572'>Tisamenus</prn> and the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>. On the way to <pl id='Q12160445'>Temenium</pl> from <pl id='Q1236078'>Lerna</pl> the river <prn id='Q743482'>Phrixus</prn> empties itself into the sea, and in <pl id='Q12160445'>Temenium</pl> is built a sanctuary of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, as well as one of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>; there is also the tomb of <prn id='Q636796'>Temenus</prn>, which is worshipped by the <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn> in <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>. </p>
<p id='2.38.2'><b>2.38.2</b> Fifty stades, I conjecture, from <pl id='Q12160445'>Temenium</pl> is <pl id='Q56399740'>Nauplia</pl>, which at the present day is uninhabited; its founder was <prn id='Q833826'>Nauplius</prn>, reputed to be a son of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> and <prn id='Q482096'>Amymone</prn>. Of the walls, too, ruins still remain and in <pl id='Q56399740'>Nauplia</pl> are a sanctuary of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, harbors, and a spring called <pl id='Q5208557'>Canathus</pl>. Here, say the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>, <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> bathes every year and recovers her maidenhood. </p>
<p id='2.38.3'><b>2.38.3</b> This is one of the sayings told as a holy secret at the mysteries which they celebrate in honor of <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn>. The story told by the people in <pl id='Q56399740'>Nauplia</pl> about the <prn id='Q19707'>ass</prn>, how by nibbling down the shoots of a vine he caused a more plenteous crop of grapes in the future, and how for this reason they have carved an <prn id='Q19707'>ass</prn> on a rock, because he taught the pruning of vines — all this I pass over as trivial. </p>
<p id='2.38.4'><b>2.38.4</b> From <pl id='Q1236078'>Lerna</pl> there is also another road, which skirts the sea and leads to a place called <pl id='Q16571062'>Genesium</pl> . By the sea is a small sanctuary of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> <prn id='Q61678456'>Genesius</prn>. Next to this is another place, called Apobathmi (Steps). The story is that this is the first place in <pl id='Q12649101'>Argolis</pl> where <prn id='Q210883'>Danaus</prn> landed with his daughters. From here we pass through what is called Anigraea, along a narrow and difficult road, until we reach a tract on the left which stretches down to the sea; </p>
<p id='2.38.5'><b>2.38.5</b> it is fertile in trees, especially the olive. As you go up inland from this is a place where three hundred picked <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> fought for this land with an equal number of specially chosen <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> warriors. All were killed except one <pl id='Q5690'>Spartan</pl> and two <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>, and here were raised the graves for the dead. But the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, having fought against the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> with all their forces, won a decisive <prn id='Q195881'>victory</prn>; at first they themselves enjoyed the fruits of the land, but afterwards they assigned it to the <pl id='Q191082'>Aeginetans</pl>, when they were expelled from their island by the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>. In my time <pl id='Q3036391'>Thyreatis</pl> was inhabited by the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>, who say that they recovered it by the award of an arbitration. </p>
<p id='2.38.6'><b>2.38.6</b> As you go from these common graves you come to <pl id='Q16483470'>Anthene</pl>, where <pl id='Q191082'>Aeginetans</pl> once made their home, another village <pl id='Q48781611'>Neris</pl>, and a third <pl id='Q16565203'>Eua</pl>, the largest of the villages, in which there is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q1406849'>Polemocrates</prn>. This <prn id='Q1406849'>Polemocrates</prn> is one of the sons of <prn id='Q674319'>Machaon</prn>, and the brother of <prn id='Q1408128'>Alexanor</prn>; he cures the people of the district, and receives honors from the neighbours. </p>
<p id='2.38.7'><b>2.38.7</b> Above the villages extends Mount <pl id='Q602371'>Parnon</pl>, on which the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> border meets the borders of the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> and <pl id='Q645234'>Tegeatae</pl>. On the borders stand stone figures of <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn>, from which the name of the <pl id='Q123501155'>place</pl> is derived. A river called Tanaus, which is the only one descending from Mount <pl id='Q602371'>Parnon</pl>, flows through the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl> territory and empties itself into the Gulf of <pl id='Q3036391'>Thyrea</pl>. </p>
<p id='3.1.1'><b>3.1.1</b> BOOK 3 <br>After the <pl id='Q123501155'>Herms</pl> we reach <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconia</pl> on the west. According to the tradition of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> themselves, <prn id='Q1419059'>Lelex</prn>, an aboriginal was the first king in this land, after whom his subjects were named <pl id='Q375221'>Leleges</pl>. <prn id='Q1419059'>Lelex</prn> had a son <prn id='Q1956649'>Myles</prn>, and a younger one <prn id='Q2102913'>Polycaon</prn>. <prn id='Q2102913'>Polycaon</prn> retired into exile, the place of this retirement and its reason I will set forth elsewhere. On the death of <prn id='Q1956649'>Myles</prn> his son <prn id='Q1378335'>Eurotas</prn> succeeded to the throne. He led down to the sea by means of a trench the stagnant water on the plain, and when it had flowed away, as what was left formed a river-stream, he named it <pl id='Q119152'>Eurotas</pl>. </p>
<p id='3.1.2'><b>3.1.2</b> Having no male issue, he left the kingdom to <prn id='Q1065774'>Lacedemon</prn>, whose mother was <prn id='Q112001'>Taygete</prn>, after whom the mountain was named, while according to report his father was none other than <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>. <prn id='Q1065774'>Lacedemon</prn> was wedded to <prn id='Q2296243'>Sparta</prn>, a daughter of <prn id='Q1378335'>Eurotas</prn>. When he came to the throne, he first changed the names of the land and its inhabitants, calling them after himself, and next he founded and named after his wife a city, which even down to our own day has been called <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>. </p>
<p id='3.1.3'><b>3.1.3</b> <prn id='Q482039'>Amyclas</prn>, too, son of <prn id='Q1065774'>Lacedemon</prn>, wished to leave some memorial behind him, and built a town in <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconia</pl>. <prn id='Q207273'>Hyacinthus</prn>, the youngest and most beautiful of his sons, died before his father, and his tomb is in <pl id='Q13074886'>Amyclae</pl> below the image of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>. On the death of <prn id='Q482039'>Amyclas</prn> the empire came to <prn id='Q644030'>Argalus</prn> [Aegalus?], the eldest of his sons, and afterwards, when <prn id='Q644030'>Argalus</prn> died, to <prn id='Q1466824'>Cynortas</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.1.4'><b>3.1.4</b> <prn id='Q1466824'>Cynortas</prn> had a son <prn id='Q1162217'>Oebalus</prn>. He took a wife from <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>, <prn id='Q950523'>Gorgophone</prn> the daughter of <prn id='Q130832'>Perseus</prn>, and begat a son <prn id='Q192946'>Tyndareus</prn>, with whom <prn id='Q342279'>Hippocoon</prn> disputed about the kingship, claiming the throne on the ground of being the eldest. With the aid of <prn id='Q1658054'>Icarius</prn> and his partisans he had surpassed <prn id='Q192946'>Tyndareus</prn> in power, and forced him to retire in fear; the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> say that he went to <pl id='Q2010159'>Pellana</pl>, but a <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> legend about him is that he fled to <prn id='Q578378'>Aphareus</prn> in <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl>, <prn id='Q578378'>Aphareus</prn> being the son of <prn id='Q342343'>Perieres</prn> and the brother of <prn id='Q192946'>Tyndareus</prn> on his mother's side. The story goes on to say that he settled at <pl id='Q16643340'>Thalamae</pl> in <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl>, and that his children were born to him when he was living there. </p>
<p id='3.1.5'><b>3.1.5</b> Subsequently <prn id='Q192946'>Tyndareus</prn> was brought back by <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> and recovered his throne.

On the return of the <prn id='Q828084'>Heracleidae</prn> in the reign of <prn id='Q2803572'>Tisamenus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q192407'>Orestes</prn>, both districts, <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl> and <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>, had kings put over them; <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> had <prn id='Q636796'>Temenus</prn> and <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl> <prn id='Q1788026'>Cresphontes</prn>. In <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl>, as the sons of <prn id='Q666525'>Aristodemus</prn> were twins, there arose two royal houses; for they say that the <prn id='Q220344'>Pythian priestess</prn> approved. </p>
<p id='3.1.6'><b>3.1.6</b> Tradition has it that <prn id='Q666525'>Aristodemus</prn> himself died at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> before the <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn> returned to the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl>, but those who glorify his fate assert that he was shot by <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> for not going to the oracle, having learned from <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, who met him before he arrived there, that the <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn> would make this return to the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl>. But the more correct account is that <prn id='Q666525'>Aristodemus</prn> was murdered by the <prn id='Q1431607'>sons</prn> of <prn id='Q494886'>Pylades</prn> and <prn id='Q131651'>Electra</prn>, who were cousins of <prn id='Q2803572'>Tisamenus</prn> son of <prn id='Q192407'>Orestes</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.1.7'><b>3.1.7</b> The names given to the sons of <prn id='Q666525'>Aristodemus</prn> were <prn id='Q1164796'>Procles</prn> and <prn id='Q960237'>Eurysthenes</prn>, and although they were twins they were bitter enemies. Their enmity reached a high pitch, but nevertheless they combined to help <prn id='Q603759'>Theras</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q784528'>Autesion</prn> and the brother of their mother <prn id='Q644374'>Argeia</prn> and their guardian as well, to found a colony. This colony <prn id='Q603759'>Theras</prn> was dispatching to the island that was then called <pl id='Q433004'>Calliste</pl>, and he hoped that the descendants of <prn id='Q12880867'>Membliarus</prn> would of their own accord give up the kingship to him. This as a matter of fact they did, </p>
<p id='3.1.8'><b>3.1.8</b> taking into account that the family of <prn id='Q603759'>Theras</prn> went back to <prn id='Q27613'>Cadmus</prn> himself, while they were only descendants of <prn id='Q12880867'>Membliarus</prn>, who was a man of the people whom <prn id='Q27613'>Cadmus</prn> left in the island to be the leader of the settlers. And <prn id='Q603759'>Theras</prn> changed the name of the island, renaming it after himself, and even at the present day the people of <pl id='Q433004'>Thera</pl> every year offer to him as their founder the sacrifices that are given to a hero. <prn id='Q1164796'>Procles</prn> and <prn id='Q960237'>Eurysthenes</prn> were of one mind in their eagerness to serve <prn id='Q603759'>Theras</prn>; but in all else their purposes were always widely different. </p>
<p id='3.1.9'><b>3.1.9</b> Even if they had agreed together, I should never have ventured to include their descendants in a common list; for they did not altogether coincide in respect of age, so that cousins, cousins' children, and later generations were not born so as to make the steps in one pedigree coincide with those of the other. So I shall give the history of each house by itself separately, instead of combining them both in one narrative. </p>
<p id='3.2.1'><b>3.2.1</b> <prn id='Q960237'>Eurysthenes</prn>, the elder of the sons of <prn id='Q666525'>Aristodemus</prn>, had, they say, a son <prn id='Q394074'>Agis</prn>, after whom the family of <prn id='Q960237'>Eurysthenes</prn> is called the <prn id='Q393652'>Agiadae</prn>. In his time, when <prn id='Q12883286'>Patreus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q3563956'>Preugenes</prn> was founding in <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaea</pl> a city which even at the present day is called <pl id='Q133123'>Patrae</pl> from this <prn id='Q12883286'>Patreus</prn>, the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> took part in the settlement. They also joined in an expedition overseas to found a colony. <prn id='Q1543376'>Gras</prn> the son of <prn id='Q1280277'>Echelas</prn> the son of <prn id='Q1336476'>Penthilus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q192407'>Orestes</prn> was the leader, who was destined to occupy the land between <pl id='Q620874'>Ionia</pl> and <pl id='Q622319'>Mysia</pl>, called at the present day <pl id='Q255325'>Aeolis</pl>; his ancestor <prn id='Q1336476'>Penthilus</prn> had even before this seized the island of <pl id='Q128087'>Lesbos</pl> that lies over against this part of the mainland. </p>
<p id='3.2.2'><b>3.2.2</b> When <prn id='Q1280328'>Echestratus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q394074'>Agis</prn>, was king at <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>, the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> removed all the <pl id='Q1431487'>Cynurians</pl> of military age, alleging as a reason that freebooters from the <pl id='Q1431487'>Cynurian</pl> territory were harrying <pl id='Q12649101'>Argolis</pl>, the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> being their kinsmen, and that the <pl id='Q1431487'>Cynurians</pl> themselves openly made forays into the land. The <pl id='Q1431487'>Cynurians</pl> are said to be <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> by descent, and tradition has it that their founder was <prn id='Q5200183'>Cynurus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q130832'>Perseus</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.2.3'><b>3.2.3</b> Not many years afterwards <prn id='Q1433820'>Labotas</prn>, son of <prn id='Q1280328'>Echestratus</prn>, became king in <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>. This <prn id='Q1433820'>Labotas</prn> <prn id='Q26825'>Herodotus</prn>, in his history of <prn id='Q184462'>Croesus</prn>, says was in his childhood the ward of <prn id='Q211326'>Lycurgus</prn> the lawgiver, but he calls him <prn id='Q1433820'>Leobotes</prn> and not <prn id='Q1433820'>Labotas</prn>. It was then that the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> first resolved to make war upon the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>, bringing as charges against them that they were annexing the <pl id='Q1431487'>Cynurian</pl> territory which they themselves had captured, and were causing revolts among their subjects the <prn id='Q288216'>Perioeci</prn> (Dwellers around). On this occasion neither of the belligerents, according to the account, achieved anything worthy of mention, </p>
<p id='3.2.4'><b>3.2.4</b> and the next kings of this house, <prn id='Q1167892'>Doryssus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q1433820'>Labotas</prn>, and <prn id='Q393054'>Agesilaus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q1167892'>Doryssus</prn>, were soon both killed. <prn id='Q211326'>Lycurgus</prn> too laid down their laws for the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> in the reign of <prn id='Q393054'>Agesilaus</prn>; some say that he was taught how to do this by the <prn id='Q220344'>Pythian priestess</prn>, others that he introduced <pl id='Q4752820'>Cretan</pl> institutions. The <pl id='Q4752820'>Cretans</pl> say that these laws of theirs were laid down by <prn id='Q23168'>Minos</prn>, and that <prn id='Q23168'>Minos</prn> was not without divine aid in his deliberations concerning them. <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> too, I think, refers in riddling words to the legislation of <prn id='Q23168'>Minos</prn> in the following verses: <br>“<pl id='Q173527'>Cnossus</pl> too, great city, among them, where <prn id='Q23168'>Minos</prn> for nine years <br>Ruled as king, and enjoyed familiar converse with great <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>.” </p>
<p id='3.2.5'><b>3.2.5</b> Of <prn id='Q211326'>Lycurgus</prn> I shall make further mention later. <prn id='Q393054'>Agesilaus</prn> had a son <prn id='Q632592'>Archelaus</prn>. In his reign the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> took by force of arms <pl id='Q15872679'>Aegys</pl>, a city of the <prn id='Q288216'>Perioeci</prn>, and sold the inhabitants into slavery, suspecting them of <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadian</pl> sympathies. <prn id='Q176022'>Charilaus</prn>, the king of the other house, helped <prn id='Q632592'>Archelaus</prn> to destroy <pl id='Q15872679'>Aegys</pl>, but the exploits he achieved when leading the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> by himself, these too I shall relate when my narrative comes to treat of those called the <prn id='Q494736'>Eurypontidae</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.2.6'><b>3.2.6</b> <prn id='Q632592'>Archelaus</prn> had a son <prn id='Q1258032'>Teleclus</prn>. In his reign the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> conquered in war and reduced <pl id='Q13074886'>Amyclae</pl>, <pl id='Q16566337'>Pharis</pl>, and <pl id='Q15890352'>Geranthrae</pl>, cities of the <prn id='Q288216'>Perioeci</prn>, which were still in the possession of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>. The inhabitants of <pl id='Q16566337'>Pharis</pl> and <pl id='Q15890352'>Geranthrae</pl>, panic-stricken at the onslaught of the <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn>, made an agreement to retire from the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl> under a truce, but those of <pl id='Q13074886'>Amyclae</pl> were not driven out at the first assault, but only after a long and stubborn resistance, in which they distinguished themselves by glorious achievements. To this heroism the <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn> bore witness by raising a trophy against the <pl id='Q13074886'>Amyclaeans</pl>, implying that their success was the most memorable exploit of that time. Not long after this <prn id='Q1258032'>Teleclus</prn> was murdered by <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> in a <pl id='Q107161014'>sanctuary of Artemis</pl>. This sanctuary was built on the frontier of <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconia</pl> and <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl>, in a place called <pl id='Q48781604'>Limnai</pl> (Lakes). </p>
<p id='3.2.7'><b>3.2.7</b> After the death of <prn id='Q1258032'>Teleclus</prn>, <prn id='Q1258989'>Alcamenes</prn> his son succeeded to the throne, and the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> sent to <pl id='Q4752820'>Crete</pl> Charmidas the son of Euthys, who was a distinguished <pl id='Q5690'>Spartan</pl>, to put down the civil strife among the <pl id='Q4752820'>Cretans</pl>, to persuade them to abandon the weak, inland towns, and to help them to people instead those that were conveniently situated for the coasting voyage. They also laid waste <pl id='Q56670610'>Helos</pl>, an <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaean</pl> town on the coast, and won a battle against the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> who came to give aid to the <prn id='Q462484'>Helots</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.3.1'><b>3.3.1</b> On the death of <prn id='Q1258989'>Alcamenes</prn>, <prn id='Q1463572'>Polydorus</prn> his son succeeded to the throne, and the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> sent colonies to <pl id='Q13526919'>Croton</pl> in <pl id='Q913582'>Italy</pl> and to the <pl id='Q3836325'>Locri</pl> by the Zephyros headland. The war called the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> reached its height in the reign of this king. As to the causes of the war, the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> version differs from the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl>. </p>
<p id='3.3.2'><b>3.3.2</b> The accounts given by the belligerents, and the manner in which this war ended, will be set forth later in my narrative. For the present I must state thus much; the chief leader of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> in the first war against the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> was <prn id='Q460405'>Theopompus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q2537646'>Nicander</prn>, a king of the other house. When the war against <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl> had been fought to a finish, and <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl> was enslaved to the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, <prn id='Q1463572'>Polydorus</prn>, who had a great reputation at <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> and was very popular with the masses — for he never did a violent act or said an insulting word to anyone, while as a judge he was both upright and humane — </p>
<p id='3.3.3'><b>3.3.3</b> his fame having by this time spread throughout Greece, was murdered by <prn id='Q3371179'>Polemarchus</prn>, a member of a distinguished family in <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl>, but, as he showed, a man of an unscrupulous temper. After his death <prn id='Q1463572'>Polydorus</prn> received many signal marks of respect from the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. However, <prn id='Q3371179'>Polemarchus</prn> too has a tomb in <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>; either he had been considered a good man before this murder, or perhaps his relatives buried him secretly. </p>
<p id='3.3.4'><b>3.3.4</b> During the reign of <prn id='Q509010'>Eurycrates</prn>, son of <prn id='Q1463572'>Polydorus</prn>, the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> submitted to be subjects of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, neither did any trouble befall from the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl> people. But in the reign of <prn id='Q488602'>Anaxander</prn>, son of <prn id='Q509010'>Eurycrates</prn> — for destiny was by this time driving the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> out of all the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl> — the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> revolted from the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. For a time they held out by force of arms, but at last they were overcome and retired from the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl> under a truce. The remnant of them left behind in the land became the slaves of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, with the exception of those in the towns on the coast. </p>
<p id='3.3.5'><b>3.3.5</b> The incidents of the war which the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> waged after the revolt from the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> it is not pertinent that I should set forth in the present part of my narrative. <prn id='Q488602'>Anaxander</prn> had a son <prn id='Q777923'>Eurycrates</prn>, and this second <prn id='Q777923'>Eurycrates</prn> a son <prn id='Q440230'>Leon</prn>. While these two kings were on the throne the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> were generally unsuccessful in the war with <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl>. But in the reign of <prn id='Q488567'>Anaxandrides</prn>, son of <prn id='Q440230'>Leon</prn>, the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> won the war with <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl> in the following manner. A <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl>, by name <prn id='Q922330'>Lichas</prn>, came to <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl> when there chanced to be a truce between the cities. </p>
<p id='3.3.6'><b>3.3.6</b> When <prn id='Q922330'>Lichas</prn> arrived the <pl id='Q5690'>Spartans</pl> were seeking the bones of <prn id='Q192407'>Orestes</prn> in accordance with an oracle. Now <prn id='Q922330'>Lichas</prn> inferred that they were buried in a smithy, the reason for this inference being this. Everything that he saw in the smithy he compared with the oracle from <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>, likening to the winds the bellows, for that they too sent forth a violent blast, the hammer to the “stroke,” the anvil to the “counterstroke” to it, while the iron is naturally a “woe to man,” because already men were using iron in warfare. In the time of those called heroes the god would have called bronze a woe to man. </p>
<p id='3.3.7'><b>3.3.7</b> Similar to the oracle about the bones of <prn id='Q192407'>Orestes</prn> was the one afterwards given to the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, that they were to bring back <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> from <pl id='Q208566'>Scyros</pl> to <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> otherwise they could not take <pl id='Q208566'>Scyros</pl>. Now the bones of <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> were discovered by <prn id='Q218102'>Cimon</prn> the son of <prn id='Q210350'>Miltiades</prn>, who displayed similar sharpness of wit, and shortly afterwards took <pl id='Q208566'>Scyros</pl>. </p>
<p id='3.3.8'><b>3.3.8</b> I have evidence that in the heroic age weapons were universally of bronze in the verses of <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> about the axe of <prn id='Q99463251'>Peisander</prn> and the arrow of <prn id='Q367819'>Meriones</prn>. My statement is likewise confirmed by the spear of <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn> dedicated in the sanctuary of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> at <pl id='Q595329'>Phaselis</pl>, and by the sword of <prn id='Q506781'>Memnon</prn> in the <pl id='Q209349'>Nicomedian</pl> temple of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>. The point and butt-spike of the spear and the whole of the sword are made of bronze. The truth of these statements I can vouch for. </p>
<p id='3.3.9'><b>3.3.9</b> <prn id='Q349897'>Anaxandrides</prn> the son of <prn id='Q440230'>Leon</prn> was the only <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> to possess at one and the same time two wives and two households. For his first consort, though an excellent wife, had the misfortune to he barren. When the ephors bade him put her away he firmly refused to do so, but made this concession to them, that he would take another wife in addition to her. The fruit of this union was a son, <prn id='Q44005'>Cleomenes</prn>; and the former wife, who up to this time had not conceived, after the birth of <prn id='Q44005'>Cleomenes</prn> bore <prn id='Q943883'>Dorieus</prn>, then <prn id='Q44228'>Leonidas</prn>, and finally <prn id='Q718102'>Cleombrotus</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.3.10'><b>3.3.10</b> And when <prn id='Q349897'>Anaxandrides</prn> died, the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, believing <prn id='Q943883'>Dorieus</prn> to be both of a sounder judgment than <prn id='Q44005'>Cleomenes</prn> and a better soldier, much against their will rejected him as their king, and obeyed the laws by giving the throne to the elder claimant <prn id='Q44005'>Cleomenes</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.4.1'><b>3.4.1</b> Now <prn id='Q943883'>Dorieus</prn> could not bear to stay at <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl> and be subject to his brother, and so he went on a colonizing expedition. As soon as he became king, <prn id='Q44005'>Cleomenes</prn> gathered together an army, both of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> themselves and of their allies, and invaded <pl id='Q12649101'>Argolis</pl>. The <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> came out under arms to meet them, but <prn id='Q44005'>Cleomenes</prn> won the day. Near the battlefield was a <prn id='Q106350076'>grove</prn> sacred to <prn id='Q649476'>Argus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q213621'>Niobe</prn>, and on being routed some five thousand of the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> took refuge therein. <prn id='Q44005'>Cleomenes</prn> was subject to fits of mad excitement, and on this occasion he ordered the <prn id='Q462484'>Helots</prn> to set the grove on fire, and the flames spread all over the grove, which, as it burned, burned up the suppliants with it. </p>
<p id='3.4.2'><b>3.4.2</b> He also conducted campaigns against <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, by the first of which he delivered the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> from the sons of <prn id='Q242172'>Peisistratus</prn> and won a good report among the Greeks both for himself personally and for the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>; while the second campaign was to please an <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl>, <prn id='Q529472'>Isagoras</prn>, by helping him to establish a tyranny over <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>. When he was disappointed, and the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> fought strenuously for their freedom, <prn id='Q44005'>Cleomenes</prn> devastated the country, including, they say, the district called <pl id='Q20639198'>Orgas</pl>, which was sacred to the deities in <pl id='Q94299853'>Eleusis</pl>. He advanced as far as <pl id='Q191082'>Aegina</pl>, and proceeded to arrest such influential <pl id='Q191082'>Aeginetans</pl> as had shown <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl> sympathies, and had persuaded the citizens to give earth and water to king <prn id='Q44387'>Dareius</prn>, son of <prn id='Q379863'>Hystaspes</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.4.3'><b>3.4.3</b> While <prn id='Q44005'>Cleomenes</prn> was occupied in <pl id='Q191082'>Aegina</pl>, <prn id='Q334478'>Demaratus</prn>, the king of the other house, was slandering him to the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> populace. On his return from <pl id='Q191082'>Aegina</pl>, <prn id='Q44005'>Cleomenes</prn> began to intrigue for the deposition of king <prn id='Q334478'>Demaratus</prn>. He bribed the <pl id='Q682558'>Pythian</pl> prophetess to frame responses about <prn id='Q334478'>Demaratus</prn> according to his instructions, and instigated <prn id='Q360151'>Leotychides</prn>, a man of royal birth and of the same family as <prn id='Q334478'>Demaratus</prn>, to put in a claim to the throne. </p>
<p id='3.4.4'><b>3.4.4</b> <prn id='Q360151'>Leotychides</prn> seized upon the remark that <prn id='Q1266372'>Ariston</prn> in his ignorance blurted out when <prn id='Q334478'>Demaratus</prn> was born, denying that he was his child. On the present occasion the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, according to their wont, referred to the oracle at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> the claim against <prn id='Q334478'>Demaratus</prn>, and the prophetess gave them a response which favoured the designs of <prn id='Q44005'>Cleomenes</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.4.5'><b>3.4.5</b> So <prn id='Q334478'>Demaratus</prn> was deposed, not rightfully, but because <prn id='Q44005'>Cleomenes</prn> hated him. Subsequently <prn id='Q44005'>Cleomenes</prn> met his end in a fit of madness for seizing a sword he began to wound himself, and hacked and maimed his body all over. The <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> assert that the manner of his end was a punishment for his treatment of the suppliants of <prn id='Q649476'>Argus</prn>; the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> say that it was because he had devastated the <pl id='Q20639198'>Orgas</pl>; the <pl id='Q75459'>Delphians</pl> put it down to the bribes he gave the <pl id='Q682558'>Pythian</pl> prophetess, persuading her to give lying responses about <prn id='Q334478'>Demaratus</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.4.6'><b>3.4.6</b> It may well be too that the wrath of heroes and the wrath of gods united together to punish <prn id='Q44005'>Cleomenes</prn> since it is a fact that for a personal wrong <prn id='Q871361'>Protesilaus</prn>, a hero not a whit more illustrious than <prn id='Q649476'>Argus</prn>, punished at <pl id='Q1234913'>Elaeus</pl> <prn id='Q4797369'>Artayctes</prn>, a <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl>; while the <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarians</pl> never succeeded in propitiating the deities at <pl id='Q94299853'>Eleusis</pl> for having encroached upon the <pl id='Q20639198'>sacred land</pl>. As to the tampering with the oracle, we know of nobody, with the exception of <prn id='Q44005'>Cleomenes</prn>, who has had the audacity even to attempt it. </p>
<p id='3.4.7'><b>3.4.7</b> <prn id='Q44005'>Cleomenes</prn> had no male issue, and the kingdom devolved on <prn id='Q44228'>Leonidas</prn>, son of <prn id='Q488567'>Anaxandrides</prn> and full brother of <prn id='Q943883'>Dorieus</prn>. At this time <prn id='Q129165'>Xerxes</prn> led his host against Greece, and <prn id='Q44228'>Leonidas</prn> with three hundred <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> met him at <pl id='Q194450'>Thermopylae</pl>. Now although the Greeks have waged many wars, and so have foreigners among themselves, yet there are but few that have been made more illustrious by the exceptional valor of one man, in the way that <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn> shed luster on the <prn id='Q42937'>Trojan War</prn> and <prn id='Q210350'>Miltiades</prn> on the engagement at <pl id='Q31900'>Marathon</pl>. But in truth the success of <prn id='Q44228'>Leonidas</prn> surpassed, in my opinion, all later as well as all previous achievements. </p>
<p id='3.4.8'><b>3.4.8</b> For <prn id='Q129165'>Xerxes</prn>, the proudest of all who have reigned over the <pl id='Q3853673'>Medes</pl>, or over the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl> who succeeded them, the achiever of such brilliant exploits, was met on his march by <prn id='Q44228'>Leonidas</prn> and the handful of men he led to <pl id='Q194450'>Thermopylae</pl>, and they would have prevented him from even seeing Greece at all, and from ever burning <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, if the man of Trachis had not guided the army with <prn id='Q1265303'>Hydarnes</prn> by the path that stretches across <pl id='Q132378'>Oeta</pl>, and enabled the enemy to surround the Greeks; so <prn id='Q44228'>Leonidas</prn> was overwhelmed and the foreigners passed along into Greece. </p>
<p id='3.4.9'><b>3.4.9</b> <prn id='Q314518'>Pausanias</prn> the son of <prn id='Q718102'>Cleombrotus</prn> never became king. For while guardian of <prn id='Q438856'>Pleistarchus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q44228'>Leonidas</prn>, who was a child when his father died, he led the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> to <pl id='Q204636'>Plataea</pl>, and afterwards with their fleet to the <pl id='Q6514'>Hellespont</pl>. I cannot praise too highly the way in which <prn id='Q314518'>Pausanias</prn> treated the <pl id='Q187027'>Coan</pl> lady, who was the daughter of a man of distinction among the <pl id='Q187027'>Coans</pl>, <prn id='Q106510479'>Hegetorides</prn> the son of Antagoras1, and the unwilling concubine of a <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl>, <prn id='Q11921574'>Pharandates</prn> the son of Teaspis. </p>
<p id='3.4.10'><b>3.4.10</b> When <prn id='Q155063'>Mardonius</prn> fell in the battle of <pl id='Q204636'>Plataea</pl>, and the foreigners were destroyed, <prn id='Q314518'>Pausanias</prn> sent the lady back to <pl id='Q187027'>Cos</pl>, and she took with her the apparel that the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl> had procured for her as well as the rest of her belongings. <prn id='Q314518'>Pausanias</prn> also refused to dishonor the body of <prn id='Q155063'>Mardonius</prn>, as <prn id='Q88388532'>Lampon</prn> the <pl id='Q191082'>Aeginetan</pl> advised him to do. </p>
<p id='3.5.1'><b>3.5.1</b> Shortly after <prn id='Q438856'>Pleistarchus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q44228'>Leonidas</prn> came to the throne he died, and the kingdom devolved on <prn id='Q371564'>Pleistoanax</prn>, son of the <prn id='Q314518'>Pausanias</prn> who commanded at <pl id='Q204636'>Plataea</pl>. <prn id='Q371564'>Pleistoanax</prn> had a son <prn id='Q433408'>Pausanias</prn>; he was the <prn id='Q433408'>Pausanias</prn> who invaded <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl>, ostensibly to oppose <prn id='Q354403'>Thrasybulus</prn> and the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, but really to establish firmly the despotism of those to whom the government had been entrusted by <prn id='Q143559'>Lysander</prn>. Although he won a battle against the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> holding the <pl id='Q13426467'>Peiraeus</pl>, yet immediately after the battle he resolved to lead his army back home, and not to bring upon <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> the most disgraceful of reproaches by increasing the despotic power of wicked men. </p>
<p id='3.5.2'><b>3.5.2</b> When he returned from <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> with only a fruitless battle to his credit, he was brought to trial by his enemies. The court that sat to try a <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> king consisted of the senate, “old men” as they were called, twenty eight in number, the members of the ephorate, and in addition the king of the other house. Fourteen senators, along with <prn id='Q202826'>Agis</prn>, the king of the other house, declared that <prn id='Q433408'>Pausanias</prn> was guilty; the rest of the court voted for his acquittal. </p>
<p id='3.5.3'><b>3.5.3</b> Shortly after this the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> gathered an army against <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>; the reason for so doing will be given in my account of <prn id='Q271850'>Agesilaus</prn>. On this occasion <prn id='Q143559'>Lysander</prn> came to <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl>, took along with him the entire <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocian</pl> army, and without any further delay entered <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl> and began assaults upon the wall of <pl id='Q359627'>Haliartus</pl>, the citizens of which refused to revolt from <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>. Already a band of <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> and <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> had secretly entered the city; these came out and offered battle before the wall, and there fell here several <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, including <prn id='Q143559'>Lysander</prn> himself. </p>
<p id='3.5.4'><b>3.5.4</b> <prn id='Q433408'>Pausanias</prn> was too late for the fight, having been collecting forces from <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl> and <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl> generally; when he finally reached <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl>, although he heard of the defeat of the forces with <prn id='Q143559'>Lysander</prn> and of the death of <prn id='Q143559'>Lysander</prn> himself, he nevertheless led his army against <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> and purposed to take the offensive. Thereupon the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> offered battle, and <prn id='Q354403'>Thrasybulus</prn> was reported to be not far away with the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>. He was waiting for the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> to take the offensive, on which his intention was to launch an attack himself against their rear. </p>
<p id='3.5.5'><b>3.5.5</b> So <prn id='Q433408'>Pausanias</prn>, fearing lest he should be caught between two enemy forces, made a truce with the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> and took up for burial those who had fallen under the wall of <pl id='Q359627'>Haliartus</pl>. The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> disapproved of this decision, but the following reason leads me to approve it. <prn id='Q433408'>Pausanias</prn> was well aware that the disasters of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> always took place when they had been caught between two enemy forces, and the defeats at <pl id='Q194450'>Thermopylae</pl> and on the island of <pl id='Q1303524'>Sphacteria</pl> made him afraid lest he himself should prove the occasion of a third misfortune for them. </p>
<p id='3.5.6'><b>3.5.6</b> But when his fellow citizens charged him with his slowness in this <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotian</pl> campaign, he did not wait to stand his trial, but was received by the people of <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl> as a suppliant of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> <prn id='Q1857789'>Alea</prn>. Now this <pl id='Q3983230'>sanctuary</pl> had been respected from early days by all the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesians</pl>, and afforded peculiar safety to its suppliants, as the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> showed in the case of <prn id='Q433408'>Pausanias</prn> and of <prn id='Q360151'>Leotychides</prn> before him, and the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> in the case of <prn id='Q5114615'>Chrysis</prn>; they never wanted even to ask for these refugees, who were sitting as suppliants in the sanctuary, to be given up. </p>
<p id='3.5.7'><b>3.5.7</b> When <prn id='Q433408'>Pausanias</prn> fled, his sons <prn id='Q357594'>Agesipolis</prn> and <prn id='Q373660'>Cleombrotus</prn> were still quite boys, and <prn id='Q15633620'>Aristodemus</prn>, their nearest relative, was their guardian. This <prn id='Q15633620'>Aristodemus</prn> was in command of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> when they won their success at <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl>. </p>
<p id='3.5.8'><b>3.5.8</b> When <prn id='Q357594'>Agesipolis</prn> grew up and came to the throne, the first <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesians</pl> against whom he waged war were the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>. When he led his army from the territory of <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl> into that of <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>, the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> sent a herald to make for them with <prn id='Q357594'>Agesipolis</prn> a certain ancestral truce, which from ancient times had been an established custom between <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn> and <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn>. But <prn id='Q357594'>Agesipolis</prn> did not make the truce with the herald, but advancing with his army proceeded to devastate the land. Then there was an earthquake, but not even so would <prn id='Q357594'>Agesipolis</prn> consent to take away his forces. And yet more than any other Greeks were the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> (in this respect like the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>) frightened by signs from heaven. </p>
<p id='3.5.9'><b>3.5.9</b> By the time that he was encamping under the wall of <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>, the earthquakes were still occurring, some of the troops had actually been killed by lightning, and some moreover had been driven out of then senses by the thunder. In this circumstance he reluctantly withdrew from <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl> territory, and began another campaign, attacking <pl id='Q1141669'>Olynthus</pl>. Victorious in the war, having captured most of the cities in <pl id='Q204728'>Chalcidice</pl>, and hoping to capture <pl id='Q1141669'>Olynthus</pl> itself, he was suddenly attacked by a disease which ended in his death. </p>
<p id='3.6.1'><b>3.6.1</b> As <prn id='Q357594'>Agesipolis</prn> died childless, the kingdom devolved upon <prn id='Q373660'>Cleombrotus</prn>, who was general in the battle at <pl id='Q2606004'>Leuctra</pl> against the <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotians</pl>. <prn id='Q373660'>Cleombrotus</prn> showed personal bravery, but fell when the battle was only just beginning. In great disasters Providence is peculiarly apt to cut off early the general, just as the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> lost <prn id='Q1620003'>Hippocrates</prn> the son of <prn id='Q12762590'>Ariphron</prn>, who commanded at <pl id='Q1184284'>Delium</pl>, and later on <prn id='Q183109'>Leosthenes</prn> in <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessaly</pl>. </p>
<p id='3.6.2'><b>3.6.2</b> <prn id='Q393079'>Agesipolis</prn>, the elder of the sons of <prn id='Q373660'>Cleombrotus</prn>, is not a striking figure in history, and was succeeded by his younger brother <prn id='Q464632'>Cleomenes</prn>. His first son was <prn id='Q421190'>Acrotatus</prn>, his second <prn id='Q930518'>Cleonymus</prn>. <prn id='Q421190'>Acrotatus</prn> did not outlive his father, and when <prn id='Q464632'>Cleomenes</prn> afterwards died, there arose a dispute about the throne between <prn id='Q930518'>Cleonymus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q464632'>Cleomenes</prn> and <prn id='Q521565'>Areus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q421190'>Acrotatus</prn>. So the senators acted as arbitrators, and decided that the dignity was the inheritance of <prn id='Q521565'>Areus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q421190'>Acrotatus</prn>, and not of <prn id='Q930518'>Cleonymus</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.6.3'><b>3.6.3</b> Deprived of his kingship <prn id='Q930518'>Cleonymus</prn> became violently angry, and the ephors tried to soothe his feelings by bestowing upon him various honors, especially the leadership of the armies, so as to prevent his becoming one day an enemy of <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>. But at last he committed many hostile acts against his fatherland, and induced <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q403377'>Aeacides</prn> to invade <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconia</pl>. </p>
<p id='3.6.4'><b>3.6.4</b> While <prn id='Q521565'>Areus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q421190'>Acrotatus</prn> was king in <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>, <prn id='Q241386'>Antigonus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q59734'>Demetrius</prn> attacked <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> with an army and a fleet. To the help of the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> there came the <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptian</pl> expedition with <prn id='Q762982'>Patroclus</prn>, and every available man of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> with <prn id='Q521565'>Areus</prn> their king at their head. </p>
<p id='3.6.5'><b>3.6.5</b> <prn id='Q241386'>Antigonus</prn> invested <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> and prevented the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> reinforcements from entering the city; so <prn id='Q762982'>Patroclus</prn> dispatched messengers urging <prn id='Q521565'>Areus</prn> and the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> to take the offensive against <prn id='Q241386'>Antigonus</prn>. On their doing so, he would himself, he said, attack the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> in rear; but before such a move it was not fair for <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptian</pl> sailors to attack <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> on land. The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> were eager to make the venture, both because of their friendship for <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> and also because they were ambitious to hand down to posterity a famous achievement, </p>
<p id='3.6.6'><b>3.6.6</b> but as their supplies were exhausted <prn id='Q643609'>Areus</prn> led his army back home, thinking that desperate measures should be reserved for one's own advantage and not risked recklessly for the benefit of others. After they had held out as long as they could, <prn id='Q241386'>Antigonus</prn> made peace with the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, on condition that he brought a garrison into the <pl id='Q116312237'>Museum</pl> to be a guard over them. After a time <prn id='Q241386'>Antigonus</prn> himself removed the garrison from <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> of his own accord while <prn id='Q643609'>Areus</prn> begat <prn id='Q421184'>Acrotatus</prn>, and <prn id='Q421184'>Acrotatus</prn> <prn id='Q643609'>Areus</prn>, who died of disease when he was just about eight years old. </p>
<p id='3.6.7'><b>3.6.7</b> And as the only male representative of the house of <prn id='Q960237'>Eurysthenes</prn> was <prn id='Q173795'>Leonidas</prn> the son of <prn id='Q930518'>Cleonymus</prn>, by this time a very old man, the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> gave him the throne. <prn id='Q173795'>Leonidas</prn>, it so happened, had a bitter opponent in <prn id='Q143559'>Lysander</prn>, a descendant of <prn id='Q143559'>Lysander</prn> the son of <prn id='Q56558632'>Aristocritus</prn>. This <prn id='Q143559'>Lysander</prn> won over to his side <prn id='Q173795'>Leonidas</prn>' son-in-law <prn id='Q887780'>Cleombrotus</prn>. After gaining his support he brought various charges against <prn id='Q173795'>Leonidas</prn>, in particular that when a boy he had sworn to his father <prn id='Q930518'>Cleonymus</prn> to ruin <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>. </p>
<p id='3.6.8'><b>3.6.8</b> So <prn id='Q173795'>Leonidas</prn> ceased to be king and <prn id='Q887780'>Cleombrotus</prn> came to the throne in his stead. Now if <prn id='Q173795'>Leonidas</prn> had given way to impulse and retired, like <prn id='Q334478'>Demaratus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q1266372'>Ariston</prn>, either to the king of <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl> or to the <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptian</pl> king, he would have profited nothing even by the <pl id='Q5690'>Spartans</pl> changing their minds. But as it was, when the citizens sentenced him to exile, he went to <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl>, whence not many years later he was recalled by the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, who made him king again. </p>
<p id='3.6.9'><b>3.6.9</b> Now how <prn id='Q310811'>Cleomenes</prn> the son of <prn id='Q173795'>Leonidas</prn> performed daring feats of valor, and how after him the <pl id='Q5690'>Spartans</pl> ceased to be ruled by kings, I have already shown in my account of <prn id='Q317331'>Aratus</prn> of <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl>. My narrative also included the manner of his death in <pl id='Q11768'>Egypt</pl>. </p>
<p id='3.7.1'><b>3.7.1</b> So of the family of <prn id='Q960237'>Eurysthenes</prn>, called the <prn id='Q393652'>Agiadae</prn>, <prn id='Q310811'>Cleomenes</prn> the son of <prn id='Q173795'>Leonidas</prn> was the last king in <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>. I will now relate what I have heard about the other house. <prn id='Q1164796'>Procles</prn> the son of <prn id='Q666525'>Aristodemus</prn> called his son <prn id='Q2417746'>Sous</prn>, whose son <prn id='Q494736'>Eurypon</prn> they say reached such a pitch of renown that this house, hitherto called the Procleidae, came to be named after him the <prn id='Q494736'>Eurypontidae</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.7.2'><b>3.7.2</b> The son of <prn id='Q1266363'>Eurypon</prn> was <prn id='Q2537664'>Prytanis</prn>, in whose reign began the enmity of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> against the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>, although even before this quarrel they made war against the <pl id='Q1431487'>Cynurians</pl>. During the generations immediately succeeding this, while <prn id='Q2714687'>Eunomus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q2537664'>Prytanis</prn> and <prn id='Q771241'>Polydectes</prn> the son of <prn id='Q2714687'>Eunomus</prn> were on the throne, <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> continued at peace, </p>
<p id='3.7.3'><b>3.7.3</b> but <prn id='Q176022'>Charillus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q771241'>Polydectes</prn> devastated the land of the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> — for he it was who invaded <pl id='Q12649101'>Argolis</pl> — and not many years afterwards, under the leadership of <prn id='Q176022'>Charillus</prn>, took place the campaign of the <pl id='Q5690'>Spartans</pl> against <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl>, when lured on by a deceptive oracle the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> hoped to capture the city and to annex the <pl id='Q645234'>Tegean</pl> plain from <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl>. </p>
<p id='3.7.4'><b>3.7.4</b> After the death of <prn id='Q176022'>Charillus</prn>, <prn id='Q2537646'>Nicander</prn> his son succeeded to the throne, in whose reign the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> murdered, in the sanctuary of <pl id='Q107161014'>Limnas</pl> (the Lady of the Lake), <prn id='Q1258032'>Teleclus</prn> the king of the other house. <prn id='Q2537646'>Nicander</prn> also invaded <pl id='Q12649101'>Argolis</pl> with an army, and laid waste the greater part of the land. The <pl id='Q1154474'>Asinaeans</pl> took part in this action with the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, and shortly after were punished by the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>, who inflicted great destruction on their fatherland and drove out the inhabitants. </p>
<p id='3.7.5'><b>3.7.5</b> About <prn id='Q460405'>Theopompus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q2537646'>Nicander</prn>, who ascended the throne after him, I shall have more to say later on, when I come to the history of <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl>. While <prn id='Q460405'>Theopompus</prn> was still king in <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> there also took place the struggle of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> with the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> for what is called the <pl id='Q3036391'>Thyreatid</pl> district. <prn id='Q460405'>Theopompus</prn> personally took no part in the affair, chiefly because of old age and sorrow, for while he was yet alive <prn id='Q31790239'>Archidamus</prn> died. </p>
<p id='3.7.6'><b>3.7.6</b> Nevertheless <prn id='Q1263112'>Archidamus</prn> did not die childless, but left a son <prn id='Q1266218'>Zeuxidamus</prn>, whose son <prn id='Q1266225'>Anaxidamus</prn> succeeded to the throne. In his reign the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> were expelled from the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl>, being vanquished for the second time by the <pl id='Q5690'>Spartans</pl>. <prn id='Q1266225'>Anaxidamus</prn> begat <prn id='Q1263112'>Archidamus</prn>, and <prn id='Q1263112'>Archidamus</prn> begat <prn id='Q741632'>Agesicles</prn>. It was the lot of both of these to pass all their lives in peace, undisturbed by any wars. </p>
<p id='3.7.7'><b>3.7.7</b> <prn id='Q1266372'>Ariston</prn>, son of <prn id='Q741632'>Agesicles</prn>, married a wife who, they say, was the ugliest maiden in <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>, but became the most beautiful of her women, because <prn id='Q164061'>Helen</prn> changed her; seven months only after his marriage with her <prn id='Q1266372'>Ariston</prn> had born to him a son, <prn id='Q334478'>Demaratus</prn>. As he was sitting in council with the ephors there came to him a servant with the news that a child was born to him. <prn id='Q1266372'>Ariston</prn>, forgetting the lines in the <prn id='Q8275'>Iliad</prn> about the birth of <prn id='Q212087'>Eurystheus</prn>, or else never having understood them at all, declared that because of the number of months the child was not his. </p>
<p id='3.7.8'><b>3.7.8</b> Afterwards he repented of his words. <prn id='Q334478'>Demaratus</prn>, a king of good repute at <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>, particularly for his helping <prn id='Q44005'>Cleomenes</prn> to free <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> from the <prn id='Q2382657'>Peisistratidae</prn>, became a private citizen through the thoughtlessness of <prn id='Q1266372'>Ariston</prn> and the hatred of <prn id='Q44005'>Cleomenes</prn>. He retired to king <prn id='Q202236'>Dareius</prn> in <pl id='Q3746183'>Persia</pl>, and they say that his descendants remained in <prn id='Q48'>Asia</prn> for a long time. </p>
<p id='3.7.9'><b>3.7.9</b> <prn id='Q360151'>Leotychides</prn>, on coming to the throne in place of <prn id='Q334478'>Demaratus</prn>, took part with the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> and the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> general <prn id='Q380401'>Xanthippus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q11906465'>Ariphron</prn>, in the engagement of <pl id='Q1330828'>Mycale</pl>, and afterwards undertook a campaign against the <prn id='Q1693536'>Aleuadae</prn> in <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessaly</pl>. Although his uninterrupted victories in the fighting might have enabled him to reduce all <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessaly</pl>, he accepted bribes from the <prn id='Q1693536'>Aleuadae</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.7.10'><b>3.7.10</b> On being brought to trial in <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl> he voluntarily went into exile to <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl>, where he sought sanctuary as a suppliant of <pl id='Q3983230'>Athena Alea</pl>. <prn id='Q1266218'>Zeuxidamus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q360151'>Leotychides</prn>, died of disease while <prn id='Q360151'>Leotychides</prn> was still alive and before he retired into exile so his son <prn id='Q313731'>Archidamus</prn> succeeded to the throne after the departure of <prn id='Q360151'>Leotychides</prn> for <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl>. This <prn id='Q313731'>Archidamus</prn> did terrible damage to the land of the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, invading <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl> with an army every year, on each occasion carrying destruction from end to end; he also besieged and took <pl id='Q742538'>Plataea</pl>, which was friendly to <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>. </p>
<p id='3.7.11'><b>3.7.11</b> Nevertheless he was not eager that war should be declared between the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesians</pl> and the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, but to the utmost of his power tried to keep the truce between them unbroken. It was <prn id='Q3973090'>Sthenelaidas</prn>, an influential <pl id='Q5690'>Spartan</pl> who was an ephor at the time, who was chiefly responsible for the war. Greece, that still stood firm, was shaken to its foundations by this war, and afterwards, when the structure had given way and was far from sound, was finally overthrown by <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn> the son of <prn id='Q313907'>Amyntas</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.8.1'><b>3.8.1</b> <prn id='Q313731'>Archidamus</prn> left sons when he died, of whom <prn id='Q202826'>Agis</prn> was the elder and inherited the throne instead of <prn id='Q271850'>Agesilaus</prn>. <prn id='Q313731'>Archidamus</prn> had also a daughter, whose name was <prn id='Q267195'>Cynisca</prn>; she was exceedingly ambitious to succeed at the <prn id='Q188468'>Olympic games</prn>, and was the first woman to breed <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn> and the first to win an <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> victory. After <prn id='Q267195'>Cynisca</prn> other women, especially women of <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl>, have won <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> victories, but none of them was more distinguished for their victories than she. </p>
<p id='3.8.2'><b>3.8.2</b> The <pl id='Q5690'>Spartans</pl> seem to me to be of all men the least moved by poetry and the praise of poets. For with the exception of the epigram upon <prn id='Q267195'>Cynisca</prn>, of uncertain authorship, and the still earlier one upon <prn id='Q314518'>Pausanias</prn> that <prn id='Q273003'>Simonides</prn> wrote on the tripod dedicated at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>, there is no poetic composition to commemorate the doings of the royal houses of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. </p>
<p id='3.8.3'><b>3.8.3</b> In the reign of <prn id='Q202826'>Agis</prn> the son of <prn id='Q313731'>Archidamus</prn> the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> had several grievances against the people of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>, being especially exasperated because they were debarred from the <prn id='Q188468'>Olympic games</prn> and the sanctuary at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>. So they dispatched a herald commanding the people of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> to grant home-rule to <pl id='Q5860679'>Lepreum</pl> and to any other of their neighbors that were subject to them. The people of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> replied that, when they saw the cities free that were neighbors of <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>, they would without delay set free their own subjects; whereupon the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> under king <prn id='Q202826'>Agis</prn> invaded the territory of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>. </p>
<p id='3.8.4'><b>3.8.4</b> On this occasion there occurred an earthquake, and the army retired home after advancing as far as <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> and the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheus</pl> but in the next year <prn id='Q202826'>Agis</prn> devastated the country and carried off most of the booty. <prn id='Q8043496'>Xenias</prn>, a man of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> who was a personal friend of <prn id='Q202826'>Agis</prn> and the state-friend of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, rose up with the rich citizens against the people but before <prn id='Q202826'>Agis</prn> and his army could come to their aid, <prn id='Q1245686'>Thrasydaeus</prn>, who at this time championed the interests of the popular party at <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>, overthrew in battle <prn id='Q8043496'>Xenias</prn> and his followers and cast them out of the city. </p>
<p id='3.8.5'><b>3.8.5</b> When <prn id='Q202826'>Agis</prn> led back his army, he left behind <prn id='Q106515408'>Lysistratus</prn>, a <pl id='Q5690'>Spartiate</pl>, with a portion of his forces, along with the <pl id='Q6536845'>Elean</pl> refugees, that they might help the <pl id='Q5860679'>Lepreans</pl> to ravage the land. In the third year of the war the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> under <prn id='Q202826'>Agis</prn> again prepared to invade the territory of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>. So <prn id='Q1245686'>Thrasydaeus</prn> and the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>, reduced to dire extremities, agreed to forgo their supremacy over their neighbors, to dismantle the fortifications of their city, and to allow the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> to sacrifice to the god and to compete in the games at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>. </p>
<p id='3.8.6'><b>3.8.6</b> <prn id='Q202826'>Agis</prn> used also to make continual incursions into <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl>, and established the fortified post at <pl id='Q1006561'>Decelea</pl> to annoy the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>. When the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> navy was destroyed at <pl id='Q404513'>Aegospotami</pl>, <prn id='Q143559'>Lysander</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q56558632'>Aristocritus</prn>, and <prn id='Q202826'>Agis</prn> violated the oaths which the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> as a state had sworn by the gods to the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, and it was on their own initiative, and without the approval of the <pl id='Q5690'>Spartan</pl> state, that they put before their allies the proposal to destroy <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> root and branch. </p>
<p id='3.8.7'><b>3.8.7</b> Such were the most remarkable military achievements of <prn id='Q202826'>Agis</prn>. The rash remark that <prn id='Q1266372'>Ariston</prn> made about <prn id='Q334478'>Demaratus</prn> was also made by <prn id='Q202826'>Agis</prn> about his son <prn id='Q3255290'>Leotychides</prn>; at the suggestion of some evil spirit he said in the hearing of the ephors that he did not believe <prn id='Q3255290'>Leotychides</prn> to be his son. Yet <prn id='Q202826'>Agis</prn>, too, repented afterwards; he was at the time being carried home sick from <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl>, and when he reached <pl id='Q3562285'>Heraea</pl>, he not only called the people to witness that he sincerely believed <prn id='Q3255290'>Leotychides</prn> to be his very own son, but also with prayers and tears charged them to take the tidings to the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. </p>
<p id='3.8.8'><b>3.8.8</b> After the death of <prn id='Q202826'>Agis</prn>, <prn id='Q271850'>Agesilaus</prn> tried to keep <prn id='Q3255290'>Leotychides</prn> from the throne, recalling to the minds of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> what <prn id='Q202826'>Agis</prn> once said about <prn id='Q3255290'>Leotychides</prn>. But the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> from <pl id='Q3562285'>Heraea</pl> arrived and bore witness for <prn id='Q3255290'>Leotychides</prn>, stating what they had heard the dying <prn id='Q202826'>Agis</prn> say. </p>
<p id='3.8.9'><b>3.8.9</b> Yet further fuel for the controversy between <prn id='Q271850'>Agesilaus</prn> and <prn id='Q3255290'>Leotychides</prn> was supplied by the oracle that was delivered at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> to this effect: <br>“<pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> beware! though haughty, pay heed to the warning I give thee. <br>Never let thy sound limbs give birth to a kingdom that lame is. <br>Too long then shalt thou lie in the clutches of desperate hardships; <br>Turmoil of war shall arise, o'erwhelming men in its billows.” </p>
<p id='3.8.10'><b>3.8.10</b> <prn id='Q3255290'>Leotychides</prn> on this occasion said that these words pointed to <prn id='Q271850'>Agesilaus</prn>, who was lame in one of his feet, while <prn id='Q271850'>Agesilaus</prn> interpreted them as alluding to the illegitimacy of <prn id='Q3255290'>Leotychides</prn>. Although they might have done so, the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> did not refer the disputed point to <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>; the reason was in my opinion that <prn id='Q143559'>Lysander</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q56558632'>Aristocritus</prn>, an active supporter of <prn id='Q271850'>Agesilaus</prn>, would have him king at all costs. </p>
<p id='3.9.1'><b>3.9.1</b> So <prn id='Q271850'>Agesilaus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q313731'>Archidamus</prn>, became king, and the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> resolved to cross with a fleet to <prn id='Q48'>Asia</prn> in order to put down <prn id='Q188472'>Artaxerxes</prn>, son of <prn id='Q202236'>Dareius</prn>. For they were informed by several of their magistrates, especially by <prn id='Q143559'>Lysander</prn>, that it was not <prn id='Q188472'>Artaxerxes</prn> but <prn id='Q297960'>Cyrus</prn> who had been supplying the pay for the fleet during the war with <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>. <prn id='Q271850'>Agesilaus</prn>, who was appointed to lead the expedition across to <prn id='Q48'>Asia</prn> and to be in command of the land forces, sent round to all parts of the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl>, except <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>, and to the Greeks north of the <pl id='Q215200'>Isthmus</pl>, asking for allies. </p>
<p id='3.9.2'><b>3.9.2</b> Now the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthians</pl> were most eager to take part in the expedition to <prn id='Q48'>Asia</prn>, but considering it a bad omen that their temple of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> surnamed <prn id='Q106460486'>Olympian</prn> had been suddenly burnt down, they reluctantly remained behind. The <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> excused themselves on the ground that their city was returning to its former state of prosperity after the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesian</pl> war and the epidemic of <prn id='Q758173'>plague</prn>, and the news brought by messengers, that <prn id='Q363832'>Conon</prn>, son of TimotheusYY, had gone up to the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl> king, strongly confirmed them in their policy of inactivity. </p>
<p id='3.9.3'><b>3.9.3</b> The envoy dispatched to <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> was AristomelYY, the father of the mother of <prn id='Q271850'>Agesilaus</prn>, a close friend of the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> who, when the wall of <pl id='Q742538'>Plataea</pl> had been taken, had been one of the judges voting that the remnant of the garrison should be put to death. Now the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> like the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> refused, saying that they would give no help. When <prn id='Q271850'>Agesilaus</prn> had assembled his <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> forces and those of the allies, and at the same time the fleet was ready, he went to <pl id='Q2612265'>Aulis</pl> to sacrifice to <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, because <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn> too had propitiated the goddess here before leading the expedition to <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl>. </p>
<p id='3.9.4'><b>3.9.4</b> <prn id='Q271850'>Agesilaus</prn>, then, claimed to be king of a more prosperous city than was <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn>, and to be like him overlord of all Greece, and that it would be a more glorious success to conquer <prn id='Q188472'>Artaxerxes</prn> and acquire the riches of <pl id='Q3746183'>Persia</pl> than to destroy the empire of <prn id='Q170473'>Priam</prn>. But even as he was sacrificing armed <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> came upon him, threw down from the altar the still burning thighbones of the victims, and drove him from the sanctuary. </p>
<p id='3.9.5'><b>3.9.5</b> Though vexed that the sacrifice was not completed, <prn id='Q271850'>Agesilaus</prn> nevertheless crossed into <prn id='Q48'>Asia</prn> and launched an attack against <pl id='Q232615'>Sardes</pl> for <pl id='Q620765'>Lydia</pl> at this period was the most important district of lower <prn id='Q48'>Asia</prn>, and <pl id='Q232615'>Sardes</pl>, pre-eminent for its wealth and resources, had been assigned as a residence to the satrap of the coast region, just as <pl id='Q180773'>Susa</pl> had been to the king himself. </p>
<p id='3.9.6'><b>3.9.6</b> A battle was fought on the plain of the <pl id='Q1351474'>Hermus</pl> with <prn id='Q355727'>Tissaphernes</prn>, satrap of the parts around <pl id='Q620874'>Ionia</pl>, in which <prn id='Q271850'>Agesilaus</prn> conquered the cavalry of the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl> and the infantry, of which the muster on this occasion had been surpassed only in the expedition of <prn id='Q129165'>Xerxes</prn> and in the earlier ones of <prn id='Q44387'>Dareius</prn> against the <pl id='Q845909'>Scythians</pl> and against <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>. The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, admiring the energy of <prn id='Q271850'>Agesilaus</prn>, added to his command the control of the fleet. But <prn id='Q271850'>Agesilaus</prn> made his brother-in-law, <prn id='Q1974236'>Peisander</prn>, admiral, and devoted himself to carrying on the war vigorously by land. </p>
<p id='3.9.7'><b>3.9.7</b> The jealousy of some deity prevented him from bringing his plans to their conclusion. For when <prn id='Q188472'>Artaxerxes</prn> heard of the victories won by <prn id='Q271850'>Agesilaus</prn>, and how, by attending to the task that lay before him, he advanced with his army even further and further, he put <prn id='Q355727'>Tissaphernes</prn> to death in spite of his previous services, and sent down to the sea <prn id='Q552396'>Tithraustes</prn>, a clever schemer who had some grudge against the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. </p>
<p id='3.9.8'><b>3.9.8</b> On his arrival at <pl id='Q232615'>Sardes</pl> he at once thought out a plan by which to force the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> to recall their army from <prn id='Q48'>Asia</prn>. He sent <prn id='Q552365'>Timocrates</prn>, a <pl id='Q13533316'>Rhodian</pl>, to Greece with money, instructing him to stir up in Greece a war against the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. Those who shared in this money are said to have been the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> <prn id='Q106521688'>Cylon</prn> and <prn id='Q106521752'>Sodamas</prn>, the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> <prn id='Q3616341'>Androcleides</prn>, <prn id='Q3099662'>Ismenias</prn> and AmphithemYY, the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> <prn id='Q106521906'>Cephalus</prn> and <prn id='Q5382605'>Epicrates</prn>, with the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthians</pl> who had <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl> sympathies, <prn id='Q11942185'>Polyanthes</prn> and <prn id='Q11951871'>Timolaus</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.9.9'><b>3.9.9</b> But those who first openly started the war were the <pl id='Q4894785'>Locrians</pl> from <pl id='Q38281545'>Amphissa</pl>. For there happened to be a piece of land the ownership of which was a matter of dispute between the <pl id='Q4894785'>Locrians</pl> and the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl>. Egged on by <prn id='Q3099662'>Ismenias</prn> and his party at <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>, the <pl id='Q4894785'>Locrians</pl> cut the ripe corn in this land and drove off the booty. The <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> on their side invaded <pl id='Q3354839'>Locris</pl> with all their forces, and laid waste the land. </p>
<p id='3.9.10'><b>3.9.10</b> So the <pl id='Q4894785'>Locrians</pl> brought in the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> as allies, and devastated <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl>. Going to <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl> the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> inveighed against the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl>, and set forth what they had suffered at their hands. The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> determined to make war against <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>, chief among their grievances being the outrageous way the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> behaved towards <prn id='Q271850'>Agesilaus</prn> when he was sacrificing at <pl id='Q2612265'>Aulis</pl>. </p>
<p id='3.9.11'><b>3.9.11</b> The <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> receiving early intimation of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>' intentions, sent to <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> begging them to submit their grievances to a court of arbitration instead of appealing to arms, but the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> dismissed the envoys in anger. The sequel, how the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> set forth and how <prn id='Q143559'>Lysander</prn> died, I have already described in my account of <prn id='Q314518'>Pausanias</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.9.12'><b>3.9.12</b> And what was called the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthian</pl> war, which continually became more serious, had its origin in the expedition of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> into <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl>. So these circumstances compelled <prn id='Q271850'>Agesilaus</prn> to lead his army back from <prn id='Q48'>Asia</prn>. Crossing with his fleet from <pl id='Q336446'>Abydos</pl> to <pl id='Q593737'>Sestos</pl> he passed through <pl id='Q41741'>Thrace</pl> as far as <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessaly</pl>, where the <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessalians</pl>, to please the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl>, tried to prevent his further progress; there was also an old friendship between them and <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>. </p>
<p id='3.9.13'><b>3.9.13</b> But <prn id='Q271850'>Agesilaus</prn> put the <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessalian</pl> cavalry to flight and passed through <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessaly</pl>, and again made his way through <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl>, winning a victory over <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> and the allies at <pl id='Q593295'>Coronea</pl>. When the <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotians</pl> were put to flight, certain of them took refuge in the <pl id='Q13574897'>sanctuary</pl> of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> surnamed <prn id='Q3627891'>Itonia</prn>. <prn id='Q271850'>Agesilaus</prn>, although suffering from a wound received in the battle, did not sin against the suppliants. </p>
<p id='3.10.1'><b>3.10.1</b> Not long afterwards the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthians</pl> in exile for pro-Spartan sympathies held the <prn id='Q675181'>Isthmian games</prn>. The <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthians</pl> in the city made no move at the time, through their fear of <prn id='Q271850'>Agesilaus</prn> but when he marched to <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>, they too celebrated the <prn id='Q675181'>Isthmian games</prn> along with the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>. <prn id='Q271850'>Agesilaus</prn> again marched with an army against <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl>, and, as the festival <prn id='Q3080551'>Hyacinthia</prn> was at hand, he gave the <pl id='Q13074886'>Amycleans</pl> leave to go back home and perform the traditional rites in honor of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> and <prn id='Q207273'>Hyacinthus</prn>. This battalion was attacked on the way and annihilated by the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> under <prn id='Q354424'>Iphicrates</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.10.2'><b>3.10.2</b> <prn id='Q271850'>Agesilaus</prn> went also to <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolia</pl> to give assistance to the <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolians</pl>, who were hard pressed in a war with, the <pl id='Q416070'>Acarnanians</pl>; these he compelled to put an end to the war, although they had come very near capturing <pl id='Q750313'>Calydon</pl> and the other towns of the <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolians</pl>. Afterwards he sailed to <pl id='Q11768'>Egypt</pl>, to succor the <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptians</pl> who had revolted from the king of <pl id='Q3746183'>Persia</pl>. <prn id='Q271850'>Agesilaus</prn> performed many noteworthy achievements in <pl id='Q11768'>Egypt</pl>, but, being by this time an old man, he died on the march. When his dead body was brought home, the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> buried it with greater honors than they had given to any other king. </p>
<p id='3.10.3'><b>3.10.3</b> In the reign of <prn id='Q448580'>Archidamus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q271850'>Agesilaus</prn>, the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> seized the sanctuary at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>. To help in a war with <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> hired with its wealth independent mercenaries, but they were also aided publicly by the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> and <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, the latter calling to mind some old service rendered by the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl>, the former, too, pretending to be friends when their real reason was, I think, hatred of the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl>. <prn id='Q4318'>Theopompus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q106515594'>Damasistratus</prn>, said that <prn id='Q448580'>Archidamus</prn> himself had a share of the <pl id='Q682558'>Delphic</pl> money, and further that <prn id='Q106515535'>Deinicha</prn> the wife of <prn id='Q448580'>Archidamus</prn>, receiving a bribe from the chief men of the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl>, made <prn id='Q448580'>Archidamus</prn> more ready to bring them reinforcements. </p>
<p id='3.10.4'><b>3.10.4</b> To accept sacred money and to help men who had pillaged the most famous of oracles I do not hold praiseworthy, but the following incident does redound to his praise. The <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> were contemplating the cruel course of killing the <pl id='Q75459'>Delphians</pl> of vigorous age, enslaving the women and children, and levelling the city itself to the ground; it was due to the intercession of <prn id='Q448580'>Archidamus</prn> that they escaped this fate at the hands of the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl>. </p>
<p id='3.10.5'><b>3.10.5</b> <prn id='Q448580'>Archidamus</prn> afterwards also crossed over into <pl id='Q913582'>Italy</pl> to help the <pl id='Q3981082'>Tarentines</pl> to wage war against their foreign neighbors. Here he was killed by the foreigners, and his corpse missed burial owing to the anger of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>. <prn id='Q314364'>Agis</prn>, the elder son of this <prn id='Q448580'>Archidamus</prn>, met his death fighting against <prn id='Q204760'>Antipater</prn> and the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl>, but while the younger son, <prn id='Q604024'>Eudamidas</prn>, was king, the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> enjoyed peace. The history of <prn id='Q299479'>Agis</prn>, son of <prn id='Q889042'>Eudamidas</prn>, and of <prn id='Q911113'>Eurydamidas</prn>, son of <prn id='Q299479'>Agis</prn>, my account of <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl> has already set forth. </p>
<p id='3.10.6'><b>3.10.6</b> On the way from the <pl id='Q123501155'>Herms</pl> the whole of the region is full of oak-trees. The name of the district, Scotitas (Dark), is not due to the unbroken woods but to <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> surnamed <prn id='Q107248794'>Scotitas</prn>, and there is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> Scotitas on the left of the road and about ten stades from it. If you go back from the sanctuary to the road, advance a little and then turn again to the left, you come to an image of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> and a trophy, which I was told <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> raised after killing <prn id='Q342279'>Hippocoon</prn> and his sons. </p>
<p id='3.10.7'><b>3.10.7</b> The third branch from the straight road is on the right, and leads to <pl id='Q59148716'>Caryae</pl> (Walnut-trees) and to the sanctuary of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>. For <pl id='Q59148716'>Caryae</pl> is a region sacred to <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> and the nymphs, and here stands in the open an image of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> <prn id='Q3356861'>Caryatis</prn>. Here every year the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> maidens hold chorus-dances, and they have a traditional native dance. On returning, as you go along the highway, you come to the ruins of <pl id='Q59431661'>Sellasia</pl>. The people of this city, as I have stated already, were sold into slavery by the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> after they had conquered in battle the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> under their king <prn id='Q310811'>Cleomenes</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q173795'>Leonidas</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.10.8'><b>3.10.8</b> In Thornax, which you will reach as you go along, is an image of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> <prn id='Q107248263'>Pythaeus</prn>, made after the style of the one at <pl id='Q13074886'>Amyclae</pl>; the fashion of it I will describe when I come to speak of the latter. For in the eyes of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> the cult of the <pl id='Q13074886'>Amyclaean</pl> is the more distinguished, so that they spent on adorning the image in <pl id='Q13074886'>Amyclae</pl> even the gold which <prn id='Q184462'>Croesus</prn> the <pl id='Q620765'>Lydian</pl> sent for <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> <prn id='Q107248263'>Pythaeus</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.11.1'><b>3.11.1</b> Farther on from Thornax is the city, which was originally named <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>, but in course of time came to be called <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedaemon</pl> as well, a name which till then belonged to the land. To prevent misconception, I added in my account of <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl> that I had not mentioned everything in order, but had made a selection of what was most noteworthy. This I will repeat before beginning my account of the <pl id='Q5690'>Spartiates</pl>; for from the beginning the plan of my work has been to discard the many trivial stories current among the several communities, and to pick out the things most worthy of mention — an excellent rule which I will never violate. </p>
<p id='3.11.2'><b>3.11.2</b> The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> who live in <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> have an agora worth seeing; the bouleuterion of the senate, and the offices of the ephors, of the guardians of the laws, and of those called the <prn id='Q20107737'>Bidiaeans</prn>, are all in the agora. The senate is the council which has the supreme control of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> constitution, the other officials form the executive. Both the ephors and the <prn id='Q20107737'>Bidiaeans</prn> are five in number; it is customary for the latter to hold competitions for the lads, particularly the one at the place called <pl id='Q3391805'>Platanistas</pl> (Plane-tree Grove), while the ephors transact the most serious business, one of them giving his name to the year, just as at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> this privilege belongs to one of those called the Nine Archons. </p>
<p id='3.11.3'><b>3.11.3</b> The most striking feature in the agora is the portico which they call the <prn id='Q28721313'>Persian Stoa</prn> because it was made from spoils taken in the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl> wars. In course of time they have altered it until it is as large and as splendid as it is now. On the pillars are white-marble figures of <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl>, including <prn id='Q155063'>Mardonius</prn>, son of <prn id='Q454695'>Gobryas</prn>. There is also a figure of <prn id='Q232128'>Artemisia</prn>, daughter of <prn id='Q3443403'>Lygdamis</prn> and queen of <pl id='Q5843680'>Halicarnassus</pl>. It is said that this lady voluntarily joined the expedition of <prn id='Q129165'>Xerxes</prn> against Greece and distinguished herself at the naval engagement off <pl id='Q178850'>Salamis</pl>. </p>
<p id='3.11.4'><b>3.11.4</b> On the agora are temples; there is one of <prn id='Q1048'>Caesar</prn>, the first Roman to covet monarchy and the first emperor under the present constitution, and also one to his son <prn id='Q1405'>Augustus</prn>, who put the empire on a firmer footing, and became a more famous and a more powerful man than his father. His name “<prn id='Q1405'>Augustus</prn>” means in Greek sebastos (reverend). </p>
<p id='3.11.5'><b>3.11.5</b> At the altar of <prn id='Q1405'>Augustus</prn> they show a bronze statue of <prn id='Q393647'>Agias</prn>. This <prn id='Q393647'>Agias</prn>, they say, by divining for <prn id='Q143559'>Lysander</prn> captured the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> fleet at <pl id='Q404513'>Aegospotami</pl> with the exception of ten ships of war. These made their escape to <pl id='Q644636'>Cyprus</pl>; all the rest the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> captured along with their crews. <prn id='Q393647'>Agias</prn> was a son of <prn id='Q42740900'>Agelochus</prn>, a son of <prn id='Q2803572'>Tisamenus</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.11.6'><b>3.11.6</b> <prn id='Q16706228'>Tisamenus</prn> belonged to the family of the <prn id='Q5980707'>Iamidae</prn> at <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>, and an oracle was given to him that he should win five most famous contests. So he trained for the pentathlon at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>, but came away defeated. And yet he was first in two events, beating <prn id='Q19945330'>Hieronymus</prn> of <pl id='Q62944263'>Andros</pl> in running and in jumping. But when he lost the wrestling bout to this competitor, and so missed the prize, he understood what the oracle meant, that the god granted him to win five contests in war by his divinations. </p>
<p id='3.11.7'><b>3.11.7</b> The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, hearing of the oracle the <prn id='Q220344'>Pythian priestess</prn> had given to <prn id='Q16706228'>Tisamenus</prn>, persuaded him to migrate from <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> and to be state-diviner at <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>. And <prn id='Q16706228'>Tisamenus</prn> won them five contests in war. The first was at <pl id='Q204636'>Plataea</pl> against the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl>; the second was at <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl>, when the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> had engaged the <pl id='Q645234'>Tegeans</pl> and <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>; the third was at <pl id='Q1227119'>Dipaea</pl>, an <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadian</pl> town in <pl id='Q112302501'>Maenalia</pl>, when all the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> except the <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineans</pl> were arrayed against them. </p>
<p id='3.11.8'><b>3.11.8</b> His fourth contest was against the <prn id='Q462484'>Helots</prn> who had rebelled and left the Isthmus for <pl id='Q602538'>Ithome</pl>. Not all the <prn id='Q462484'>Helots</prn> revolted, only the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> element, which separated itself off from the old <prn id='Q462484'>Helots</prn>. These events I shall relate presently. On the occasion I mention the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> allowed the rebels to depart under a truce, in accordance with the advice of <prn id='Q16706228'>Tisamenus</prn> and of the oracle at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>. The last time <prn id='Q16706228'>Tisamenus</prn> divined for them was at <pl id='Q56259452'>Tanagra</pl>, an engagement taking place with the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> and <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>. </p>
<p id='3.11.9'><b>3.11.9</b> Such I learned was the history of <prn id='Q16706228'>Tisamenus</prn>. On their agora the <pl id='Q5690'>Spartans</pl> have images of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> <prn id='Q107248263'>Pythaeus</prn>, of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> and of <prn id='Q103107'>Leto</prn>. The whole of this region is called Choros (Dancing), because at the <prn id='Q1558425'>Gymnopaediae</prn>, a festival which the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> take more seriously than any other, the lads perform dances in honor of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>. Not far from them is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q93172'>Earth</prn> and of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q4693579'>Agoraios</prn>, another of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> <prn id='Q4693579'>Agoraia</prn> and of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> surnamed <prn id='Q55804838'>Asphalios</prn> (Securer), and likewise one of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> and of <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.11.10'><b>3.11.10</b> There is also dedicated a colossal statue of the <pl id='Q5690'>Spartan</pl> Demos (people). The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> have also a sanctuary of the <prn id='Q180287'>Fates</prn>, by which is the grave of <prn id='Q192407'>Orestes</prn>, son of <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn>. For when the bones of <prn id='Q192407'>Orestes</prn> were brought from <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl> in accordance with an oracle they were buried here. Beside the grave of <prn id='Q192407'>Orestes</prn> is a statue of <prn id='Q1463572'>Polydorus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q1258989'>Alcamenes</prn>, a king who rose to such honor that the magistrates seal with his likeness everything that requires sealing. </p>
<p id='3.11.11'><b>3.11.11</b> There is also <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> <prn id='Q21548139'>Agoraios</prn> carrying <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> as a child, besides the old Courts of the <prn id='Q109432'>Ephors</prn>, as they are called, in which are the tombs of <prn id='Q319406'>Epimenides</prn> the <pl id='Q4752820'>Cretan</pl> and of <prn id='Q578378'>Aphareus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q342343'>Perieres</prn>. As to <prn id='Q319406'>Epimenides</prn>, I think the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> story is more probable than the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl>. Here, where the <prn id='Q180287'>Fates</prn> are, the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> also have a sanctuary of <prn id='Q41419'>Hestia</prn>. There is also <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> Xenios (Hospitable) and <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> Hospitable. </p>
<p id='3.12.1'><b>3.12.1</b> As you go from the agora by the road they name the Aphetaid Road, you come to the so-called <prn id='Q122079936'>Booneta</prn>. But my narrative must first explain why the road has this name. It is said that <prn id='Q1658054'>Icarius</prn> proposed a foot-race for the wooers of <prn id='Q165769'>Penelope</prn>; that <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn> won is plain, but they say that the competitors were let go (aphethenai) for the race along the Aphetaid Road. </p>
<p id='3.12.2'><b>3.12.2</b> In my opinion, <prn id='Q1658054'>Icarius</prn> was imitating <prn id='Q210883'>Danaus</prn> when he held the running-race. For <prn id='Q210883'>Danaus</prn> contrived the following plan to solve the difficulty about his daughters. Nobody would take a wife from among them because of their pollution so <prn id='Q210883'>Danaus</prn> sent round a notice that he would give away his daughters without bride-gifts, and that each suitor could choose the one whose beauty pleased him most. A few men came, among whom he held a foot-race the first comer was allowed to choose before all the others, after him the second, and so on to the last. The daughters that were left had to wait until other suitors arrived and competed in another foot-race. </p>
<p id='3.12.3'><b>3.12.3</b> On this road the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> have, as I have already said, what is called the <prn id='Q122079936'>Booneta</prn> ("ox-bought"), which once was the house of their king <prn id='Q1463572'>Polydorus</prn>. When he died, they bought it from his widow, paying the price in <prn id='Q473194'>oxen</prn>. For at that time there was as yet neither silver nor gold coinage, but they still bartered in the old way with <prn id='Q473194'>oxen</prn>, slaves, and uncoined silver and gold. </p>
<p id='3.12.4'><b>3.12.4</b> Those who sail to <pl id='Q17055962'>India</pl> say that the natives give other merchandise in exchange for Greek cargoes, knowing nothing about coinage, and that though they have plenty of gold and of bronze. On the opposite side of the office of the Bidiaeans is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>. <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn> is said to have set up the image and to have named it KeleutheaYY (Lady of the Road), when he had beaten the suitors of <prn id='Q165769'>Penelope</prn> in the foot-race. Of KeleutheaYY he set up sanctuaries, three in number, at some distance from each other. </p>
<p id='3.12.5'><b>3.12.5</b> Farther along the Aphetaid Road are hero-shrines, of Iops, who is supposed to have been born in the time of <prn id='Q1419059'>Lelex</prn> or <prn id='Q1956649'>Myles</prn>, and of <prn id='Q330584'>Amphiaraus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q1358973'>Oicles</prn>. The last they think was made by the sons of <prn id='Q192946'>Tyndareus</prn>, for that <prn id='Q330584'>Amphiaraus</prn> was their cousin. There is a hero-shrine of <prn id='Q1419059'>Lelex</prn> himself. Not far from these is a precinct of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> of <pl id='Q33119266'>Taenarum</pl>, which is the surname given him, </p>
<p id='3.12.6'><b>3.12.6</b> and near by an image of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, which is said to have been dedicated by the colonists who left for <pl id='Q3981082'>Tarentum</pl> in <pl id='Q913582'>Italy</pl>. As to the place they call the Hellenium, it has been stated that those of the Greeks who were preparing to repel <prn id='Q129165'>Xerxes</prn> when he was crossing into Europe deliberated at this place how they should resist. The other story is that those who made the expedition against <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl> to please <prn id='Q171839'>Menelaus</prn> deliberated here how they could sail out to <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl> and exact satisfaction from <prn id='Q167646'>Alexander</prn> for carrying off <prn id='Q164061'>Helen</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.12.7'><b>3.12.7</b> Near the Hellenium they point out the tomb of <prn id='Q1367860'>Talthybius</prn>. The <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> of <pl id='Q60790078'>Aegium</pl> too say that a tomb which they show on their agora belongs to <prn id='Q1367860'>Talthybius</prn>. It was this <prn id='Q1367860'>Talthybius</prn> whose wrath at the murder of the heralds, who were sent to Greece by king <prn id='Q44387'>Dareius</prn> to demand earth and water, left its mark upon the whole state of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, but in <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> fell upon individuals, the members of the house of one man, <prn id='Q210350'>Miltiades</prn> the son of <prn id='Q14278582'>Cimon</prn>. <prn id='Q210350'>Miltiades</prn> was responsible for the death at the hands of the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> of those of the heralds who came to <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl>. </p>
<p id='3.12.8'><b>3.12.8</b> The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> have an altar of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> <pl id='Q21008093'>Acritas</pl>, and a sanctuary, surnamed <prn id='Q107349793'>Gasepton</prn>, of <prn id='Q93172'>Earth</prn>. Above it is set up <prn id='Q60847441'>Maleatian</prn> <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>. At the end of the Aphetaid Road, quite close to the wall, are a sanctuary of <prn id='Q5805670'>Dictynna</prn> and the royal graves of those called the <prn id='Q494736'>Eurypontidae</prn>. Beside the Hellenium is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q9160370'>Arsinoe</prn>, daughter of <prn id='Q2316900'>Leucippus</prn> and sister of the wives of <prn id='Q190103'>Polydeuces</prn> and <prn id='Q11294144'>Castor</prn>. At the place called the Forts (Phrouria) is a temple of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, and a little further on has been built a tomb for the diviners from <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>, called the <prn id='Q5980707'>Iamidae</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.12.9'><b>3.12.9</b> There is also a sanctuary of <prn id='Q115140144'>Maron</prn> and of <prn id='Q115140099'>Alpheius</prn>.

The sanctuary of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q106963414'>Tropaeus</prn> (He who turns to flight) was made by the <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn>, when they had conquered in war the <pl id='Q13074886'>Amyclaeans</pl>, as well as the other <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, who at that time occupied <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconia</pl>. The sanctuary of the <prn id='Q334486'>Great Mother</prn> has paid to it the most extraordinary honors. After it come the hero-shrines of <prn id='Q338201'>Hippolytus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>, and of the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadian</pl> <prn id='Q55973606'>Aulon</prn>, son of <prn id='Q12760106'>Tlesimenes</prn>.

<p id='3.12.10'><b>3.12.10</b> Leading from the agora is another road, on which they have built what is called <prn id='Q107360820'>Scias</prn> (Canopy), where even at the present day they hold their meetings of the Assembly. This Canopy was made, they say, by <prn id='Q3286634'>Theodorus</prn> of <pl id='Q13580795'>Samos</pl>, who discovered the melting of iron and the moulding of images from it.

But this <prn id='Q5044177'>Carnus</prn> is not the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> <prn id='Q671534'>Carneus</prn> of the House, who was worshipped in the house of <prn id='Q106471131'>Crius</prn> the seer while the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> were still in possession of <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>. </p>

A mother is wont to sacrifice to the goddess when a daughter is married. On the road to the right of the hill is a statue of <prn id='Q20671219'>Hetoemocles</prn>.

<p id='3.14.1'><b>3.14.1</b> On going westwards from the agora is a cenotaph of <prn id='Q311742'>Brasidas</prn> the son of Tellis1. Not far from it is the <prn id='Q28599124'>theater</prn>, made of white marble and worth seeing. Opposite the theater are two tombs; the first is that of <prn id='Q314518'>Pausanias</prn>, the general at <pl id='Q204636'>Plataea</pl>, the second is that of <prn id='Q44228'>Leonidas</prn>. Every year they deliver speeches over them, and hold a contest in which none may compete except <pl id='Q5690'>Spartans</pl>. The bones of <prn id='Q44228'>Leonidas</prn> were taken by <prn id='Q314518'>Pausanias</prn> from <pl id='Q194450'>Thermopylae</pl> forty years after the battle. There is set up a slab with the names, and their fathers' names, of those who endured the fight at <pl id='Q194450'>Thermopylae</pl> against the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl>. </p>
<p id='3.14.2'><b>3.14.2</b> There is a place in <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> called Theomelida. In this part of the city are the graves of the <prn id='Q393652'>Agiad</prn> kings, and near is what is called the clubhouse (lesche) of the Crotani, who form a part of the <pl id='Q752699'>Pitanatans</pl>. Not far from the clubhouse is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>, called “in the place of the <prn id='Q393652'>Agiadae</prn>.” Farther on is the tomb of <prn id='Q7674863'>Taenarus</prn>, after whom they say the <pl id='Q33119266'>headland</pl> was named that juts out into the sea. Here are sanctuaries of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> Hippocurius (<prn id='Q726'>Horse</prn>-tending) and of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> Aeginaea (<prn id='Q2934'>Goat</prn>-goddess?). On returning to the clubhouse you see a sanctuary of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> <prn id='Q107243311'>Issoria</prn>. They surname her also <prn id='Q107247447'>Limnaia</prn>, though she is not really <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> but <prn id='Q831577'>Britomartis</prn> of <pl id='Q4752820'>Crete</pl>. I deal with her in my account of <pl id='Q191082'>Aegina</pl>. </p>
<p id='3.14.3'><b>3.14.3</b> Very near to the tombs which have been built for the <prn id='Q393652'>Agiadae</prn> you will see a slab, on which are written the victories in the foot-race won, at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> and elsewhere, by <prn id='Q1074480'>Chionis</prn>, a <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl>. The <pl id='Q38888'>Olympian</pl> victories were seven, four in the single-stade race and three in the double-stade race. The race with the shield, that takes place at the end of the contest, was not at that time one of the events. It is said that <prn id='Q1074480'>Chionis</prn> also took part in the expedition of <prn id='Q409834'>Battus</prn> of <pl id='Q433004'>Thera</pl>, helped him to found <pl id='Q44112'>Cyrene</pl> and to reduce the neighboring <pl id='Q2370577'>Libyans</pl>. </p>
<p id='3.14.4'><b>3.14.4</b> The sanctuary of <prn id='Q184437'>Thetis</prn> was set up, they say, for the following reason. The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> were making war against the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>, who had revolted, and their king <prn id='Q488602'>Anaxander</prn>, having invaded <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl>, took prisoners certain women, and among them <prn id='Q106540840'>Cleo</prn>, priestess of <prn id='Q184437'>Thetis</prn>. This <prn id='Q106540840'>Cleo</prn> the wife of <prn id='Q488602'>Anaxander</prn> asked for from her husband, and discovering that she had the wooden image of <prn id='Q184437'>Thetis</prn>, she set up with her a temple for the goddess. This Leandris did because of a vision in a dream, </p>
<p id='3.14.5'><b>3.14.5</b> but the <prn id='Q693222'>xoanon</prn> of <prn id='Q184437'>Thetis</prn> is guarded in secret. The cult of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> <prn id='Q57444528'>Chthonia</prn> (of the Lower World) the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> say was handed on to them by <prn id='Q174353'>Orpheus</prn>, but in my opinion it was because of the sanctuary in <pl id='Q58401924'>Hermione</pl> that the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> also began to worship <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> <prn id='Q57444528'>Chthonia</prn>. The <pl id='Q5690'>Spartans</pl> have also a sanctuary of <prn id='Q214554'>Serapis</prn>, the newest sanctuary in the city, and one of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> surnamed <prn id='Q106460486'>Olympian</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.14.6'><b>3.14.6</b> The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> give the name Dromos (Running Course) to the place where it is the custom for the young men even down to the present day to practise running. As you go to this Dromos from the grave of the <prn id='Q393652'>Agiadae</prn>, you see on the left the tomb of <prn id='Q106540916'>Eumedes</prn> — this <prn id='Q106540916'>Eumedes</prn> was one of the children of <prn id='Q342279'>Hippocoon</prn> — and also an old image of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, to whom sacrifice is paid by the Sphaereis. These are those who are just passing from youth to manhood. In the Dromos are two gymnastic schools, one being a votive gift of <prn id='Q19720500'>Eurycles</prn>, a <pl id='Q5690'>Spartan</pl>. Outside the Dromos, over against the image of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, there is a house belonging now to a private individual, but in olden times to <prn id='Q171839'>Menelaus</prn>. Farther away from the Dromos are sanctuaries of the <prn id='Q190103'>Dioscuri</prn>, of the <prn id='Q184353'>Graces</prn>, of <prn id='Q94066'>Eileithyia</prn>, of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> <prn id='Q671534'>Carneus</prn>, and of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> Leader. </p>
<p id='3.14.7'><b>3.14.7</b> The sanctuary of Agnitas has been made on the right of the Dromos; Agnitas is a surname of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>, because the god had a <prn id='Q693222'>xoanon</prn> of agnus castus. The agnus is a willow like the thorn. Not far from <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> stands a trophy, raised, they say, by <prn id='Q190103'>Polydeuces</prn> to celebrate his victory over <prn id='Q1124866'>Lynceus</prn>. This is one of the pieces of evidence that confirm my statement that the sons of <prn id='Q578378'>Aphareus</prn> were not buried in <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>. At the beginning of the Dromos are the <prn id='Q190103'>Dioscuri</prn> Apheterioi (Starters), and a little farther on a hero-shrine of <prn id='Q3609040'>Alcon</prn>, who they say was a son of <prn id='Q342279'>Hippocoon</prn>. Beside the shrine of <prn id='Q3609040'>Alcon</prn> is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, whom they surname Domatites (“of the House”). </p>
<p id='3.14.8'><b>3.14.8</b> And there is a place called <pl id='Q3391805'>Platanistas</pl> from the unbroken ring of tall plane trees growing round it. The place itself, where it is customary for the youths to fight, is surrounded by a moat just like an island in the sea; you enter it by bridges. On each of the two bridges stand images; on one side an image of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, on the other a likeness of <prn id='Q211326'>Lycurgus</prn>. Among the laws <prn id='Q211326'>Lycurgus</prn> laid down for the constitution are those regulating the fighting of the youths. </p>
<p id='3.14.9'><b>3.14.9</b> There are other acts performed by the youths, which I will now describe. Before the fighting they sacrifice in the Phoebaeum, which is outside the city, not far distant from <pl id='Q15940498'>Therapne</pl>. Here each company of youths sacrifices a <prn id='Q39266'>puppy</prn> to <prn id='Q1345963'>Enyalius</prn>, holding that the most valiant of tame animals is an acceptable victim to the most valiant of the gods. I know of no other Greeks who are accustomed to sacrifice <prn id='Q39266'>puppies</prn> except the people of <pl id='Q1142488'>Colophon</pl>; these too sacrifice a <prn id='Q39266'>puppy</prn>, a black <prn id='Q39266'>bitch</prn>, to <prn id='Q5379354'>Enodia</prn> (the Wayside Goddess). Both the sacrifice of the <pl id='Q1142488'>Colophonians</pl> and that of the youths at <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> are appointed to take place at night. </p>
<p id='3.14.10'><b>3.14.10</b> At the sacrifice the youths set trained <prn id='Q58697'>boars</prn> to fight; the company whose <prn id='Q58697'>boar</prn> happens to win generally gains the victory in <pl id='Q3391805'>Platanistas</pl>. Such are the performances in the Phoebaeum. A little before the middle of the next day they enter by the bridges into the place I have mentioned. They cast lots during the night to decide by which entrance each band is to go in. In fighting they use their hands, kick with their feet, bite, and gouge out the eyes of their opponents. Man to man they fight in the way I have described, but in the melee they charge violently and push one another into the water. </p>
<p id='3.15.1'><b>3.15.1</b> At <pl id='Q3391805'>Platanistas</pl> there is also a hero-shrine of <prn id='Q267195'>Cynisca</prn>, daughter of <prn id='Q313731'>Archidamus</prn> king of the <pl id='Q5690'>Spartans</pl>. She was the first woman to breed <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn>, and the first to win a chariot race at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>. Behind the portico built by the side of <pl id='Q3391805'>Platanistas</pl> are other hero-shrines, of <prn id='Q18018281'>Alcimus</prn>, of <prn id='Q5375236'>Enaraephorus</prn>, at a little distance away one of <prn id='Q11917689'>Dorceus</prn>, and close to it one of <prn id='Q15847062'>Sebrus</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.15.2'><b>3.15.2</b> These are said to be sons of <prn id='Q342279'>Hippocoon</prn>. The fountain near the hero-shrine of <prn id='Q11917689'>Dorceus</prn> they call Dorcean after him; the place Sebrium is named after <prn id='Q15847062'>Sebrus</prn>. On the right of Sebrium is the tomb of <prn id='Q298850'>Alcman</prn>, the lyric poet, the charm of whose works was not in the least spoilt by the <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconian</pl> dialect, which is the least musical of them all. </p>
<p id='3.15.3'><b>3.15.3</b> There are sanctuaries of <prn id='Q164061'>Helen</prn> and of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>; the former is near the grave of <prn id='Q298850'>Alcman</prn>, the latter is quite close to the wall and contains an armed image of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>. The attitude of the image is due, they say, to the fight with <prn id='Q342279'>Hippocoon</prn> and his sons. The enmity of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> towards the family of <prn id='Q342279'>Hippocoon</prn> is said to have sprung out of their refusing to cleanse him when he came to <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> for cleansing after the death of <prn id='Q1672196'>Iphitus</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.15.4'><b>3.15.4</b> The following incident, too, helped to begin the feud. <prn id='Q2641175'>Oeonus</prn>, a stripling cousin of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> — he was the son of <prn id='Q2335647'>Licymnius</prn> the brother of <prn id='Q190543'>Alcmene</prn> — came to <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> along with <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, and went round to view the city. When he came to the house of <prn id='Q342279'>Hippocoon</prn>, a house-<prn id='Q144'>dog</prn> attacked him. <prn id='Q2641175'>Oeonus</prn> happened to throw a stone which knocked over the <prn id='Q144'>dog</prn>. So the sons of <prn id='Q342279'>Hippocoon</prn> ran out, and dispatched <prn id='Q2641175'>Oeonus</prn> with their clubs. </p>
<p id='3.15.5'><b>3.15.5</b> This made <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> most bitterly wroth with <prn id='Q342279'>Hippocoon</prn> and his sons, and straightway, angry as he was, he set out to give them battle. On this occasion he was wounded, and made good his retreat by stealth but afterwards he made an expedition against <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> and succeeded in avenging himself on <prn id='Q342279'>Hippocoon</prn>, and also on the sons of <prn id='Q342279'>Hippocoon</prn> for their murder of <prn id='Q2641175'>Oeonus</prn>. The tomb of <prn id='Q2641175'>Oeonus</prn> is built by the side of the sanctuary of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.15.6'><b>3.15.6</b> As you go from the Dromos towards the east, there is a path on the right, with a sanctuary of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> called <prn id='Q55996285'>Axiopoinos</prn> (Just Requital or Tit for Tat). For when <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, in avenging himself on <prn id='Q342279'>Hippocoon</prn> and his sons, had inflicted upon them a just requital for their treatment of his relative, he founded a sanctuary of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, and surnamed her Axiopoinos because the ancients used to call vengeance poinai. There is another sanctuary of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> on another road from the Dromos. It was dedicated, they say, by <prn id='Q603759'>Theras</prn> son of <prn id='Q784528'>Autesion</prn> son of <prn id='Q1788541'>Tisamenus</prn> son of <prn id='Q1289213'>Thersander</prn>, when he was leading a colony to the island now called <pl id='Q433004'>Thera</pl> after him, the name of which in ancient times was <pl id='Q433004'>Calliste</pl> (Fairest). </p>
<p id='3.15.7'><b>3.15.7</b> Near is a temple of <prn id='Q18986572'>Hipposthenes</prn>, who won so many victories in wrestling. They worship <prn id='Q18986572'>Hipposthenes</prn> in accordance with an oracle, paying him honors as to <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>. Opposite this temple is an old image of <prn id='Q1345963'>Enyalius</prn> in fetters. The idea the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> express by this image is the same as the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> express by their <pl id='Q384813'>Wingless</pl> <prn id='Q165023'>Victory</prn>; the former think that <prn id='Q1345963'>Enyalius</prn> will never run away from them, being bound in the fetters, while the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> think that <prn id='Q165023'>Victory</prn>, having no wings, will always remain where she is. In this fashion, and with such a belief have these cities set up the <prn id='Q693222'>xoana</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.15.8'><b>3.15.8</b> In <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> is a lesche (clubhouse,lounge) called Poikile (painted), and by it hero-shrines of <prn id='Q27613'>Cadmus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q392631'>Agenor</prn>, and of his descendants <prn id='Q923898'>Oeolycus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q603759'>Theras</prn>, and <prn id='Q4687553'>Aegeus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q923898'>Oeolycus</prn>. They are said to have been made by <prn id='Q106541051'>Maesis</prn>, <prn id='Q106541078'>Laeas</prn> and <prn id='Q106541096'>Europas</prn>, sons of <prn id='Q106541037'>Hyraeus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q4687553'>Aegeus</prn>. They made for <prn id='Q474888'>Amphilochus</prn> too his hero-shrine, because their ancestor <prn id='Q1788541'>Tisamenus</prn> had for his mother <prn id='Q10265000'>Demonassa</prn>, the sister of <prn id='Q474888'>Amphilochus</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.15.9'><b>3.15.9</b> The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> are the only Greeks who surname <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> <prn id='Q122079200'>Goat-eater</prn>, and sacrifice <prn id='Q2934'>goats</prn> to the goddess. They say that <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> founded the sanctuary and was the first to sacrifice <prn id='Q2934'>goats</prn>, because in his fight against <prn id='Q342279'>Hippocoon</prn> and his children he met with no hindrance from <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn>, although in his other adventures he thought that the goddess opposed him. He sacrificed <prn id='Q2934'>goats</prn>, they say, because he lacked other kinds of victims. </p>
<p id='3.15.10'><b>3.15.10</b> Not far from the theater is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> <prn id='Q107349797'>Genethlios</prn> (God of Kin), and there are hero-shrines of <prn id='Q329690'>Cleodaeus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q847268'>Hyllus</prn>, and of <prn id='Q1162217'>Oebalus</prn>. The most famous of their sanctuaries of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> has been built near <prn id='Q122079936'>Booneta</prn>, and on the left is the hero-shrine of <prn id='Q1258032'>Teleclus</prn>. I shall mention him again later in my history of <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl>. A little farther on is a small hill, on which is an ancient temple with a <prn id='Q693222'>xoanon</prn> (wooden image) of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> armed. This is the only temple I know that has an upper storey built upon it, a sanctuary of <prn id='Q107349798'>Morpho</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.15.11'><b>3.15.11</b> <prn id='Q107349798'>Morpho</prn> is a surname of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>, who sits wearing a veil and with fetters on her feet. The story is that the fetters were put on her by <prn id='Q192946'>Tyndareus</prn>, who symbolized by the bonds the faithfulness of wives to their husbands. The other account, that <prn id='Q192946'>Tyndareus</prn> punished the goddess with fetters because he thought that from <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> had come the shame of his daughters, I will not admit for a moment. For it were surely altogether silly to expect to punish the goddess by making a cedar figure and naming it <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.16.1'><b>3.16.1</b> Near is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q383960'>Hilaeira</prn> and of <prn id='Q3499887'>Phoebe</prn>. The author of the poem <prn id='Q1075630'>Cypria</prn> calls them daughters of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>. Their priestesses are young maidens, called, as are also the goddesses, <prn id='Q7489356'>Leucippides</prn> (Daughter of <prn id='Q2316900'>Leucippus</prn>). One of the images was adorned by a Leucippis who had served the goddesses as a priestess. She gave it a face of modern workmanship instead of the old one; she was forbidden by a dream to adorn the other one as well. Here there has been hung from the roof an egg tied to ribands, and they say that it is the famous egg that legend says <prn id='Q182019'>Leda</prn> brought forth. </p>
<p id='3.16.2'><b>3.16.2</b> Each year the women weave a tunic for the <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> at <pl id='Q13074886'>Amyclae</pl>, and they call Chiton (Tunic) the chamber in which they do their weaving. Near it is built a house, said to have been occupied originally by the sons of <prn id='Q192946'>Tyndareus</prn>, but afterwards it was acquired by Phormio1, a <pl id='Q5690'>Spartan</pl>. To him came the <prn id='Q190103'>Dioscuri</prn> in the likeness of strangers. They said that they had come from <pl id='Q44112'>Cyrene</pl>, and asked to lodge with him, requesting to have the chamber which had pleased them most when they dwelt among men. </p>
<p id='3.16.3'><b>3.16.3</b> He replied that they might lodge in any other part of the house they wished, but that they could not have the chamber. For it so happened that his maiden daughter was living in it. By the next day this maiden and all her girlish apparel had disappeared, and in the room were found images of the <prn id='Q190103'>Dioscuri</prn>, a table, and silphium upon it. </p>
<p id='3.16.4'><b>3.16.4</b> Such is the story. As you go from the Chiton (Tunic) in the direction of the gate there is a hero-shrine of <prn id='Q34601'>Cheilon</prn>, who is considered one of the <prn id='Q207782'>Seven Sages</prn>, and also of AthenodorYY, one of those who with <prn id='Q943883'>Dorieus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q488567'>Anaxandrides</prn> set out for <pl id='Q4951156'>Sicily</pl>. The reason of their setting out was that they held that the <pl id='Q110983687'>Erycine</pl> district belonged to the descendants of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> and not to the foreigners who held it. The story is that <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> wrestled with <prn id='Q430157'>Eryx</prn> on these terms: if <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> won, the land of <prn id='Q430157'>Eryx</prn> was to belong to him but if he were beaten, <prn id='Q430157'>Eryx</prn> was to depart with the <prn id='Q830'>cows</prn> of <prn id='Q86805'>Geryon</prn>; </p>
<p id='3.16.5'><b>3.16.5</b> for <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> at the time was driving these away, and when they swam across to <pl id='Q4951156'>Sicily</pl> he too crossed over in search of them near the bent olive-tree. The favour of heaven was more partial to <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> than it was afterwards to <prn id='Q943883'>Dorieus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q488567'>Anaxandrides</prn>; <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> killed <prn id='Q430157'>Eryx</prn>, but <prn id='Q943883'>Dorieus</prn> himself and the greater part of his army were destroyed by the <pl id='Q692847'>Egestaeans</pl>. </p>
<p id='3.16.6'><b>3.16.6</b> The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> have also made a sanctuary for <prn id='Q211326'>Lycurgus</prn>, who drew up the laws, looking upon him as a god. Behind the temple is the grave of <prn id='Q123411650'>Eucosmus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q211326'>Lycurgus</prn>, and by the altar the grave of <prn id='Q12880073'>Lathria</prn> and <prn id='Q47005693'>Anaxandra</prn>. Now these were themselves twins, and therefore the sons of <prn id='Q666525'>Aristodemus</prn>, who also were twins likewise, took them to wife; they were daughters of <prn id='Q31790230'>Thersander</prn> son of <prn id='Q31789655'>Agamedidas</prn>, king of the <pl id='Q1774167'>Cleonaeans</pl> and great-grandson of <prn id='Q16190194'>Ctesippus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>. Opposite the temple is the tomb of <prn id='Q460405'>Theopompus</prn> son of <prn id='Q2537646'>Nicander</prn>, and also that of <prn id='Q499025'>Eurybiades</prn>, who commanded the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> warships that fought the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl> at <pl id='Q105317807'>Artemisium</pl> and <pl id='Q178850'>Salamis</pl>. Near is what is called the hero-shrine of <prn id='Q4811170'>Astrabacus</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.16.7'><b>3.16.7</b> The place named Limnaeum (Marshy) is sacred to <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> <prn id='Q105335595'>Ortheia</prn>. The wooden image (<prn id='Q693222'>xoanon</prn>) there they say is that which once <prn id='Q192407'>Orestes</prn> and <prn id='Q192673'>Iphigenia</prn> stole out of the <pl id='Q7835'>Tauric</pl> land, and the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> say that it was brought to their land because there also <prn id='Q192407'>Orestes</prn> was king. I think their story more probable than that of the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>. For what could have induced <prn id='Q192673'>Iphigenia</prn> to leave the image behind at <pl id='Q475497'>Brauron</pl>? Or why did the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, when they were preparing to abandon their land, fail to include this image in what they put on board their ships? </p>
<p id='3.16.8'><b>3.16.8</b> And yet, right down to the present day, the fame of the <pl id='Q7835'>Tauric</pl> goddess has remained so high that the <pl id='Q217265'>Cappadocians</pl> dwelling on the <pl id='Q621672'>Euxine</pl> claim that the image is among them, a like claim being made by those <pl id='Q620765'>Lydians</pl> also who have a sanctuary of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> <prn id='Q484278'>Anaeitis</prn>. But the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, we are asked to believe, made light of it becoming booty of the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl>. For the image at <pl id='Q475497'>Brauron</pl> was brought to <pl id='Q180773'>Susa</pl>, and afterwards <prn id='Q184176'>Seleucus</prn> gave it to the Syrians of <pl id='Q11931162'>Laodicea</pl>, who still possess it. </p>
<p id='3.16.9'><b>3.16.9</b> I will give other evidence that the <prn id='Q105335595'>Orthia</prn> in <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl> is the <pl id='Q550466'>xoanon</pl> from the foreigners. Firstly, <prn id='Q4811170'>Astrabacus</prn> and <prn id='Q22965372'>Alopecus</prn>, sons of <prn id='Q22965472'>Irbus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q3616667'>Amphisthenes</prn>, son of <prn id='Q106541771'>Amphicles</prn>, son of <prn id='Q394074'>Agis</prn>, when they found the image straightway became insane. Secondly, the <pl id='Q5690'>Spartan</pl> <pl id='Q48781604'>Limnatians</pl>, the Cynosurians, and the people of <prn id='Q60791981'>Mesoa</prn> and <pl id='Q60791979'>Pitane</pl>, while sacrificing to <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, fell to quarreling, which led also to bloodshed; many were killed at the altar and the rest died of disease. </p>
<p id='3.16.10'><b>3.16.10</b> Whereat an oracle was delivered to them, that they should stain the <pl id='Q550466'>altar</pl> with human blood. He used to be sacrificed upon whomsoever the lot fell, but <prn id='Q211326'>Lycurgus</prn> changed the custom to a scourging of the lads, and so in this way the altar is stained with human blood. By them stands the priestess, holding the <prn id='Q693222'>xoanon</prn>. Now it is small and light, </p>
<p id='3.16.11'><b>3.16.11</b> but if ever the scourgers spare the lash because of a lad's beauty or high rank, then at once the priestess finds the <prn id='Q693222'>xoanon</prn> grow so heavy that she can hardly carry it. She lays the blame on the scourgers, and says that it is their fault that she is being weighed down. So the image ever since the sacrifices in the <pl id='Q7835'>Tauric</pl> land keeps its fondness for human blood. They call it not only <prn id='Q105335595'>Orthia</prn>, but also <prn id='Q107349799'>Lygodesma</prn> (Willow-bound), because it was found in a thicket of willows, and the encircling willow made the image stand upright. </p>
<p id='3.17.1'><b>3.17.1</b> Not far from the <pl id='Q550466'>Orthia</pl> is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q94066'>Eileithyia</prn>. They say that they built it, and came to worship <prn id='Q94066'>Eileithyia</prn> as a goddess, because of an oracle from <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>. The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> have no acropolis rising to a conspicuous height like the <pl id='Q11225429'>Cadmea</pl> at <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> and the <pl id='Q1012861'>Larisa</pl> at <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>. There are, however, hills in the city, and the highest of them they call the acropolis. </p>
<p id='3.17.2'><b>3.17.2</b> Here is built a sanctuary of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, who is called both <prn id='Q107244276'>Poliouchos</prn> (City-protecting) and Lady of the Bronze House. The building of the <pl id='Q57302774'>sanctuary</pl> was begun, they say, by <prn id='Q192946'>Tyndareus</prn>. On his death his children were desirous of making a second attempt to complete the building, and the resources they intended to use were the spoils of <pl id='Q618453'>Aphidna</pl>. They too left it unfinished, and it was many years afterwards that the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> made of bronze both the temple and the image of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>. The builder was <prn id='Q1010778'>Gitiadas</prn>, a native of <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>, who also composed <prn id='Q285494'>Dorian</prn> lyrics, including a hymn to the goddess. </p>
<p id='3.17.3'><b>3.17.3</b> On the bronze are wrought in relief many of the labours of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> and many of the voluntary exploits he successfully carried out, besides the rape of the daughters of <prn id='Q2316900'>Leucippus</prn> and other achievements of the sons of <prn id='Q192946'>Tyndareus</prn>. There is also <prn id='Q44384'>Hephaestus</prn> releasing his mother from the fetters. The legend about this I have already related in my history of <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl>. There are also represented nymphs bestowing upon <prn id='Q130832'>Perseus</prn>, who is starting on his enterprise against <prn id='Q160730'>Medusa</prn> in <pl id='Q2370577'>Libya</pl>, a cap and the shoes by which he was to be carried through the air. There are also wrought the birth of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, <prn id='Q180222'>Amphitrite</prn>, and <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, the largest figures, and those which I thought the best worth seeing. </p>
<p id='3.17.4'><b>3.17.4</b> There is here another sanctuary of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>; her surname is <prn id='Q1350313'>Ergane</prn> (Worker). As you go to the south portico there is a temple of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> surnamed <prn id='Q58822135'>Cosmetas</prn> (Orderer), and before it is the tomb of <prn id='Q192946'>Tyndareus</prn>. The west portico has two <prn id='Q2092297'>eagles</prn>, and upon them are two Victories. <prn id='Q143559'>Lysander</prn> dedicated them to commemorate both his exploits; the one was off <pl id='Q47611'>Ephesus</pl>, when he conquered <prn id='Q3618730'>Antiochus</prn>, the captain of <prn id='Q187982'>Alcibiades</prn>, and the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> warships and the second occurred later, when he destroyed the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> fleet at <pl id='Q404513'>Aegospotami</pl>. </p>
<p id='3.17.5'><b>3.17.5</b> On the left of the Lady of the <pl id='Q57302774'>Bronze House</pl> they have set up a sanctuary of the <prn id='Q66016'>Muses</prn>, because the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> used to go out to fight, not to the sound of the trumpet, but to the music of the flute and the accompaniment of lyre and harp. Behind the Lady of the <pl id='Q57302774'>Bronze House</pl> is a temple of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> <prn id='Q106518607'>Areia</prn> (Warlike). The <prn id='Q693222'>xoana</prn> are as old as any in Greece. </p>
<p id='3.17.6'><b>3.17.6</b> On the right of the Lady of the <pl id='Q57302774'>Bronze House</pl> has been set up an image of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q107243158'>Hypatos</prn> (Most High), the oldest image that is made of bronze. It is not wrought in one piece. Each of the limbs has been hammered separately; these are fitted together, being prevented from coming apart by nails. They say that the artist was <prn id='Q3680378'>Clearchus</prn> of <pl id='Q3429952'>Rhegium</pl>, who is said by some to have been a pupil of <prn id='Q15806048'>Dipoenus</prn> and <prn id='Q19999327'>Scyllis</prn>, by others of <prn id='Q134756'>Daedalus</prn> himself. By what is called the Scenoma (Tent) there is a statue of a woman, whom the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> say is <prn id='Q44887'>Euryleonis</prn>. She won a victory at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> with a two-horse chariot. </p>
<p id='3.17.7'><b>3.17.7</b> By the side of the altar of the Lady of the <pl id='Q57302774'>Bronze House</pl> stand two statues of <prn id='Q314518'>Pausanias</prn>, the general at <pl id='Q204636'>Plataea</pl>. His history, as it is known, I will not relate. The accurate accounts of my predecessors suffice; I shall content myself with adding to them what I heard from a man of <pl id='Q23725'>Byzantium</pl>. <prn id='Q314518'>Pausanias</prn> was detected in his treachery, and was the only suppliant of the Lady of the <pl id='Q57302774'>Bronze House</pl> who failed to win security, solely because he had been unable to wipe away a defilement of bloodshed. </p>
<p id='3.17.8'><b>3.17.8</b> When he was cruising about the <pl id='Q6514'>Hellespont</pl> with the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> and allied fleets, he fell in love with a <pl id='Q23725'>Byzantine</pl> maiden. And straightway at the beginning of night <prn id='Q106518700'>Cleonice</prn> — that was the girl's name — was brought by those who had been ordered to do so. But <prn id='Q314518'>Pausanias</prn> was asleep at the time and the noise awoke him. For as she came to him she unintentionally dropped her lighted lamp. And <prn id='Q314518'>Pausanias</prn>, conscious of his treason to Greece, and therefore always nervous and fearful, jumped up then and struck the girl with his sword. </p>
<p id='3.17.9'><b>3.17.9</b> From this defilement <prn id='Q314518'>Pausanias</prn> could not escape, although he underwent all sorts of purifications and became a suppliant of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q106522413'>Phyxius</prn> (God of Flight), and finally went to the wizards at <pl id='Q7623270'>Phigalia</pl> in <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl> but he paid a fitting penalty to <prn id='Q106518700'>Cleonice</prn> and to the god. The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, in fulfillment of a command from <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>, had the bronze images made and honor the daimon <prn id='Q5382860'>Epidotes</prn> (Bountiful), saying that it was this <prn id='Q5382860'>Epidotes</prn> that turns aside the wrath that <prn id='Q106522431'>Hicesius</prn> (the god of Suppliants) shows because of <prn id='Q314518'>Pausanias</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.18.1'><b>3.18.1</b> Near the statues of <prn id='Q314518'>Pausanias</prn> is an image of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> <prn id='Q4741672'>Ambologera</prn> (Postponer of Old Age), which was set up in accordance with an oracle; there are also images of <prn id='Q189347'>Sleep</prn> and of <prn id='Q199647'>Death</prn>. They think them brothers, in accordance with the verses in the <prn id='Q8275'>Iliad</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.18.2'><b>3.18.2</b> As you go towards what is called the Aliteion [Alpium in ms] is a temple of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> <prn id='Q107349800'>Ophthalmitis</prn> (Goddess of the Eye). They say that <prn id='Q211326'>Lycurgus</prn> dedicated it when one of his eyes had been struck out by <prn id='Q4712917'>Alcander</prn>, because the laws he had made happened not to find favour with <prn id='Q4712917'>Alcander</prn>. Having fled to this place he was defended by the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> and avoided losing his remaining eye, and so he made this temple of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> <prn id='Q107349800'>Ophthalmitis</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.18.3'><b>3.18.3</b> Farther on from here is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q3575327'>Ammon</prn>. From the first the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> are known to have used the oracle in <pl id='Q2370577'>Libya</pl> more than any other Greeks. It is said also that when <prn id='Q143559'>Lysander</prn> was besieging <pl id='Q4779776'>Aphytis</pl> in <pl id='Q2625955'>Pallene</pl> <prn id='Q3575327'>Ammon</prn> appeared by night and declared that it would be better for him and for <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl> if they ceased from warring against <pl id='Q4779776'>Aphytis</pl>. And so <prn id='Q143559'>Lysander</prn> raised the siege, and induced the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> to worship the god still more.

<p id='3.18.4'><b>3.18.4</b> The story of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> <prn id='Q58419769'>Cnagia</prn> is as follows. <prn id='Q3681782'>Cnageus</prn>, they say, was a native who joined the <prn id='Q190103'>Dioscuri</prn> in their expedition against <pl id='Q618453'>Aphidna</pl>. Being taken prisoner in the battle and sold into <pl id='Q4752820'>Crete</pl>, he lived as a slave where the <pl id='Q4752820'>Cretans</pl> had a sanctuary of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>; but in course of time he ran away in the company of the maiden priestess, who took the image with her. It is for this reason that they name <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> <prn id='Q58419769'>Cnagia</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.18.5'><b>3.18.5</b> But I am of opinion that <prn id='Q3681782'>Cnageus</prn> came to <pl id='Q4752820'>Crete</pl> in some other way, and not in the manner the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> state; for I do not think there was a battle at <pl id='Q618453'>Aphidna</pl> at all, <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> being detained among the <pl id='Q2551754'>Thesprotians</pl> and the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> not being unanimous, their sympathies inclining towards <prn id='Q781867'>Menestheus</prn>. Moreover, even if a fight occurred, nobody would believe that prisoners were taken from the conquerors, especially as the victory was overwhelming, so that <pl id='Q618453'>Aphidna</pl> itself was captured. </p>
<p id='3.18.6'><b>3.18.6</b> I must now end my criticisms. As you go down to <pl id='Q13074886'>Amyclae</pl> from <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> you come to a river called Tiasa.

They believe that <prn id='Q1065774'>Lacedemon</prn> founded the sanctuary for the <prn id='Q184353'>Graces</prn> here, and gave them their names. </p>
<p id='3.18.7'><b>3.18.7</b> The things worth seeing in <pl id='Q13074886'>Amyclae</pl> include a victor in the pentathlon, named <prn id='Q405989'>Aenetus</prn>, on a stele.

<p id='3.19.1'><b>3.19.1</b> The part of the throne where the god would sit is not continuous; there are several seats, and by the side of each seat is left a wide empty space, the middle, whereon the image stands, being the widest of them. </p>
<p id='3.19.2'><b>3.19.2</b> I know of nobody who has measured the height of the image, but at a guess one would estimate it to be as much as thirty cubits. It is not the work of <prn id='Q2891279'>Bathycles</prn>, being old and uncouth; for though it has face, feet, and hands, the rest resembles a bronze pillar. On its head it has a helmet, in its hands a spear and a bow. </p>
<p id='3.19.3'><b>3.19.3</b> The pedestal of the statue is fashioned into the shape of an altar and they say that <prn id='Q207273'>Hyacinthus</prn> is buried in it, and at the <prn id='Q3080551'>Hyacinthia</prn>, before the sacrifice to <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, they devote offerings to <prn id='Q207273'>Hyacinthus</prn> as to a hero into this altar through a bronze door, which is on the left of the altar.

Now this statue of <prn id='Q207273'>Hyacinthus</prn> represents him as bearded, but <prn id='Q2583871'>Nicias</prn>, son of NicomedesYY, has painted him in the very prime of youthful beauty, hinting at the love of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> for <prn id='Q207273'>Hyacinthus</prn> of which legend tells. </p>
<p id='3.19.5'><b>3.19.5</b> Wrought on the altar is also <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>; he too is being led to heaven by <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> and the other gods.

As for the <prn id='Q467515'>West Wind</prn>, how <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> unintentionally killed <prn id='Q207273'>Hyacinthus</prn>, and the story of the flower, we must be content with the legends, although perhaps they are not true history. </p>
<p id='3.19.6'><b>3.19.6</b> <pl id='Q13074886'>Amyclae</pl> was laid waste by the <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn>, and since that time has remained a village; I found there a <pl id='Q111081967'>sanctuary</pl> and image of <prn id='Q170779'>Alexandra</prn> worth seeing. Alexandra is said by the <pl id='Q13074886'>Amyclaeans</pl> to be <prn id='Q170779'>Cassandra</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q170473'>Priam</prn>. Here is also a statue of <prn id='Q131157'>Clytaemnestra</prn>, together with what is supposed to be the tomb of <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn>. The natives worship the <pl id='Q13074886'>Amyclaean</pl> god and <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>, surnaming the latter, quite correctly I think, <prn id='Q107349801'>Psilax</prn>. For psila is <prn id='Q285494'>Doric</prn> for wings, and wine uplifts men and lightens their spirit no less than wings do birds.

<p id='3.19.7'><b>3.19.7</b> Another road from the city leads to <pl id='Q15940498'>Therapne</pl>, and on this road is a xoanon of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> <prn id='Q1857789'>Alea</prn>.

Across the river is a temple of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> <prn id='Q58822427'>Cotyleus</prn> (of the Hip-joint); it was made by <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, who named <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> <prn id='Q58822427'>Cotyleus</prn>, because he was cured of the wound in the hip-joint that he received in the former fight with <prn id='Q342279'>Hippocoon</prn> and his <prn id='Q122081751'>sons</prn>. Of all the objects along this road the oldest is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q40901'>Ares</prn>.

<p id='3.19.8'><b>3.19.8</b> They surname him <prn id='Q107245649'>Theritas</prn> after <prn id='Q32571235'>Thero</prn>, who is said to have been the nurse of <prn id='Q40901'>Ares</prn>. Perhaps it was from the <pl id='Q183150'>Colchians</pl> that they heard the name <prn id='Q107245649'>Theritas</prn>, since the Greeks know of no <prn id='Q32571235'>Thero</prn>, nurse of <prn id='Q40901'>Ares</prn>. My own belief is that the surname <prn id='Q107245649'>Theritas</prn> was not given to <prn id='Q40901'>Ares</prn> because of his nurse, but because when a man meets an enemy in battle he must cast aside all gentleness, as <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> says of <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn>: <br>And he is fierce as a <prn id='Q140'>lion</prn>.” [Il. 24.41] </p>
<p id='3.19.9'><b>3.19.9</b> The name of <pl id='Q15940498'>Therapne</pl> is derived from the daughter of <prn id='Q1419059'>Lelex</prn>, and in it is a <pl id='Q23069794'>temple</pl> of <prn id='Q171839'>Menelaus</prn>; they say that <prn id='Q171839'>Menelaus</prn> and <prn id='Q164061'>Helen</prn> were buried here. The account of the <pl id='Q13533316'>Rhodians</pl> is different.

So she sent against her when she was bathing handmaidens dressed up as <prn id='Q180262'>Furies</prn>, who seized <prn id='Q164061'>Helen</prn> and hanged her on a tree, and for this reason the <pl id='Q13533316'>Rhodians</pl> have a sanctuary of <prn id='Q164061'>Helen</prn> <prn id='Q12100068'>Dendritis</prn> (of the Tree). </p>

<p id='3.19.12'><b>3.19.12</b> The first to sail thither, legend says, was <prn id='Q17285070'>Leonymus</prn> of <pl id='Q13526919'>Crotona</pl>.

With them, he said, were <prn id='Q186271'>Patroclus</prn> and <prn id='Q577552'>Antilochus</prn>; <prn id='Q164061'>Helen</prn> was wedded to <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn>, and had bidden him sail to <prn id='Q332797'>Stesichorus</prn> at <pl id='Q1111219'>Himera</pl>, and announce that the loss of his sight was caused by her wrath. </p>
<p id='3.20.1'><b>3.20.1</b> Therefore <prn id='Q332797'>Stesichorus</prn> composed his recantation. In <pl id='Q15940498'>Therapne</pl> I remember seeing the fountain MesseisYY. Some of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, however, have declared that of old the name MesseisYY was given, not to the fountain at <pl id='Q15940498'>Therapne</pl>, but to the one we call Polydeucea. The fountain Polydeucea and a sanctuary of <prn id='Q190103'>Polydeuces</prn> are on the right of the road to <pl id='Q15940498'>Therapne</pl>. </p>
<p id='3.20.2'><b>3.20.2</b> Not far from <pl id='Q15940498'>Therapne</pl> is what is called Phoebaeum, in which is a temple of the <prn id='Q190103'>Dioscuri</prn>. Here the youths sacrifice to <prn id='Q1345963'>Enyalius</prn>. At no great distance from it stands a sanctuary of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> surnamed <prn id='Q106517783'>Earthholder</prn>. Going on from here in the direction of <pl id='Q515809'>Taygetus</pl> you come to a place called Alesiae (Place of Grinding) they say that <prn id='Q1956649'>Myles</prn> (Mill-man) the son of <prn id='Q1419059'>Lelex</prn> was the first human being to invent a mill, and that he ground corn in this Alesiae. Here they have a hero-shrine of <prn id='Q1065774'>Lacedemon</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q112001'>Taygete</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.20.3'><b>3.20.3</b> Crossing from here a river Phellia, and going past <pl id='Q13074886'>Amyclae</pl> along a road leading straight towards the sea, you come to the site of <pl id='Q16566337'>Pharis</pl>, which was once a city of <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconia</pl>. Turning away from the Phellia to the right is the road that leads to Mount <pl id='Q515809'>Taygetus</pl>. On the plain is a precinct of <pl id='Q60792058'>Zeus Messapeus</pl>, who is surnamed, they say, after a man who served the god as his priest. Leaving <pl id='Q515809'>Taygetus</pl> from here you come to the site of the city <pl id='Q29015947'>Bryseae</pl>. There still remains here a temple of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> with an image in the open. But the image in the temple women only may see, for women by themselves perform in secret the sacrificial rites. </p>
<p id='3.20.4'><b>3.20.4</b> Above <pl id='Q29015947'>Bryseae</pl> rises Taletum, a peak of <pl id='Q515809'>Taygetus</pl>. They call it sacred to <prn id='Q134270'>Helius</prn> (the Sun), and among the sacrifices they offer here to <prn id='Q134270'>Helius</prn> are <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn>. I am aware that the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl> also are wont to offer the same sacrifice. Not far from Taletum is a place called Euoras, the haunt of wild animals, especially wild <prn id='Q2934'>goats</prn>. In fact all <pl id='Q515809'>Taygetus</pl> is a hunting-ground for these <prn id='Q2934'>goats</prn> and for <prn id='Q58697'>boars</prn>, and it is well stocked with both deer and bears. </p>
<p id='3.20.5'><b>3.20.5</b> Between Taletum and Euoras is a place they name Therae, where they say <prn id='Q103107'>Leto</prn> from the peaks of <pl id='Q515809'>Taygetus</pl> . . . is a <pl id='Q79104156'>sanctuary</pl> of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> surnamed <prn id='Q79104156'>Eleusinian</prn>. Here according to the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> story <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> was hidden by <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> while he was being healed of a wound. In the <pl id='Q79104156'>sanctuary</pl> is a <prn id='Q693222'>xoanon</prn> (wooden image) of <prn id='Q174353'>Orpheus</prn>, a work, they say, of <pl id='Q14472556'>Pelasgians</pl>. </p>
<p id='3.20.6'><b>3.20.6</b> I know also of the following rite which is performed here. By the sea was a city <pl id='Q56670610'>Helos</pl>, which <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> too has mentioned in his list of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>: <br>“These had their home in <pl id='Q13074886'>Amyclae</pl>, and in <pl id='Q56670610'>Helos</pl> the town by the seaside.” It was founded by <prn id='Q134270'>Helius</prn>, the youngest of the sons of <prn id='Q130832'>Perseus</prn>, and the <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn> afterwards reduced it by siege. Its inhabitants became the first slaves of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> state, and were the first to be called <prn id='Q462484'>Helots</prn>, as in fact <prn id='Q462484'>Helots</prn> they were. The slaves afterwards acquired, although they were <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn> of <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl>, also came to be called <prn id='Q462484'>Helots</prn>, just as the whole Greek race were called Hellenes from the region in <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessaly</pl> once called <prn id='Q11772'>Hellas</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.20.7'><b>3.20.7</b> From this <pl id='Q56670610'>Helos</pl>, on stated days, they bring up to the <pl id='Q79104156'>sanctuary</pl> of the <pl id='Q94299853'>Eleusinian</pl> a <prn id='Q693222'>xoanon</prn> of <prn id='Q45967'>Kore</prn>, daughter of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>. Fifteen stades distant from the sanctuary is <pl id='Q60792059'>Lapithaeum</pl>, named after <prn id='Q106521021'>Lapithus</prn>, a native of the district. So this <pl id='Q60792059'>Lapithaeum</pl> is on <pl id='Q515809'>Taygetus</pl>, and not far off is <prn id='Q60792061'>Dereium</prn>, where is in the open an image of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> Dereatis, and beside it is a spring which they name Anonus. About twenty stades past <prn id='Q60792061'>Dereium</prn> is <prn id='Q60792060'>Harpleia</prn>, which extends as far as the plain. </p>
<p id='3.20.8'><b>3.20.8</b> On the road from <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> to <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl> there stands in the open an image of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> surnamed <prn id='Q107349805'>Pareia</prn>, and after it is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn>. This it is not customary to open, but all the youths who are going to take part in the contest in <pl id='Q3391805'>Platanistas</pl> are wont to sacrifice to <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn> before the fight. The <pl id='Q5690'>Spartans</pl> say that the sanctuary was made for them by <prn id='Q106521034'>Prax</prn>, a grandson of <prn id='Q2097787'>Pergamus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q322639'>Neoptolemus</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.20.9'><b>3.20.9</b> Further on is what is called the Tomb of <prn id='Q726'>Horse</prn>. For <prn id='Q192946'>Tyndareus</prn>, having sacrificed a <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn> here, administered an oath to the suitors of <prn id='Q164061'>Helen</prn>, making them stand upon the pieces of the <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn>. The oath was to defend <prn id='Q164061'>Helen</prn> and him who might be chosen to marry her if ever they should be wronged. When he had sworn the suitors he buried the <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn> here. Seven pillars, which are not far from this tomb . . . in the ancient manner, I believe, which they say are images of the planets. On the road is a precinct of Cranius surnamed Stemmatias, and a sanctuary of <prn id='Q107349806'>Mysian</prn> <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.20.10'><b>3.20.10</b> The image of <prn id='Q404076'>Aidos</prn> (Modesty), some thirty stades distant from the city, they say was dedicated by <prn id='Q1658054'>Icarius</prn>, the following being the reason for making it. When <prn id='Q1658054'>Icarius</prn> gave <prn id='Q165769'>Penelope</prn> in marriage to <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn>, he tried to make <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn> himself settle in <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl>, but failing in the attempt, he next besought his daughter to remain behind, and when she was setting forth to Ithaca he followed the chariot, begging her to stay. </p>
<p id='3.20.11'><b>3.20.11</b> <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn> endured it for a time, but at last he bade <prn id='Q165769'>Penelope</prn> either to accompany him willingly, or else, if she preferred her father, to go back to <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl>. They say that she made no reply, but covered her face with a veil in reply to the question, so that <prn id='Q1658054'>Icarius</prn>, realizing that she wished to depart with <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn>, let her go, and dedicated an image of <prn id='Q404076'>Aidos</prn>; for <prn id='Q165769'>Penelope</prn>, they say, had reached this point of the road when she veiled herself. </p>
<p id='3.21.1'><b>3.21.1</b> Twenty stades from here the stream of the <pl id='Q119152'>Eurotas</pl> comes very near to the road, and here is the tomb of <prn id='Q11931075'>Ladas</prn>, the fastest runner of his day. He was crowned at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> for a victory in the long race, and falling ill, I take it, immediately after the victory he was on his way home; his death took place here, and his grave is above the highway. His namesake [<prn id='Q19720603'>Ladas</prn>, who also won at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> a victory, not in the long race but in the short race, is stated in the <pl id='Q6536845'>Elean</pl> records of <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> victors to have been a native of <pl id='Q60790078'>Aegium</pl> in <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaia</pl>. </p>
<p id='3.21.2'><b>3.21.2</b> Farther on in the direction of <pl id='Q2010159'>Pellana</pl> is what is called Characoma (Trench); and after it <pl id='Q2010159'>Pellana</pl>, which in the olden time was a city. They say that <prn id='Q192946'>Tyndareus</prn> dwelt here when he fled from <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> before <prn id='Q342279'>Hippocoon</prn> and his sons. Remarkable sights I remember seeing here were a sanctuary of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> and the spring Pellanis. Into it they say a maiden fell when she was drawing water, and when she had disappeared the veil on her head reappeared in another spring, Lancia. </p>
<p id='3.21.3'><b>3.21.3</b> A hundred stades away from <pl id='Q2010159'>Pellana</pl> is the place called <pl id='Q16537117'>Belemina</pl>. It is naturally the best watered region of <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconia</pl>, seeing that the river <pl id='Q119152'>Eurotas</pl> passes through it, while it has abundant springs of its own. </p>
<p id='3.21.4'><b>3.21.4</b> As you go down to the sea towards <pl id='Q56398303'>Gythium</pl> you come to a village called <pl id='Q48781592'>Croceae</pl> and a quarry. It is not a continuous stretch of rock, but the <prn id='Q1789729'>stones</prn> they dig out are shaped like river pebbles; they are hard to work, but when worked sanctuaries of the gods might be adorned with them, while they are especially adapted for beautifying swimming-baths and fountains. Here before the village stands an image of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q107349807'>Krokeatas</prn> (of <pl id='Q48781592'>Croceae</pl>) in stone, and the <prn id='Q190103'>Dioscuri</prn> in bronze are at the quarry. </p>
<p id='3.21.5'><b>3.21.5</b> After <pl id='Q48781592'>Croceae</pl>, turning away to the right from the straight road to <pl id='Q56398303'>Gythium</pl>, you will reach a city <pl id='Q60790659'>Aegiae</pl>. They say that this is the city which <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> in his poem calls Augeae. Here is a lake called <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>'s, and by the lake is a temple with an image of the god. They are afraid to take out the fish, saying that a fisherman in these waters turns into the fish called the fisher. </p>
<p id='3.21.6'><b>3.21.6</b> <pl id='Q56398303'>Gythium</pl> is thirty stades distant from <pl id='Q60790659'>Aegiae</pl>, built by the sea in the territory of the <prn id='Q3556008'>Free Laconians</prn>, whom the emperor <prn id='Q1405'>Augustus</prn> freed from the bondage in which they had been to the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> in <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>. All the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl>, except the <pl id='Q215200'>Isthmus of Corinth</pl>, is surrounded by sea, but the best shell-fish for the manufacture of purple dye after those of the <pl id='Q41642'>Phoenician</pl> sea are to be found on the coast of <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconia</pl>. </p>
<p id='3.21.7'><b>3.21.7</b> The <prn id='Q3556008'>Free Laconians</prn> have eighteen cities; the first as you go down from <pl id='Q60790659'>Aegiae</pl> to the sea is <pl id='Q56398303'>Gythium</pl>; after it come <pl id='Q48781583'>Teuthrone</pl> and <pl id='Q7142558'>Las</pl> and <pl id='Q7263760'>Pyrrhichus</pl>; on <pl id='Q33119266'>Taenarum</pl> are <pl id='Q29788547'>Caenepolis</pl>, <pl id='Q11921115'>Oetylus</pl>, <pl id='Q11931799'>Leuctra</pl> and <pl id='Q16643340'>Thalamae</pl>, and in addition <pl id='Q3773354'>Alagonia</pl> and <pl id='Q5550565'>Gerenia</pl>. On the other side of <pl id='Q56398303'>Gythium</pl> by the sea are <pl id='Q12874174'>Asopus</pl>, <pl id='Q25858222'>Acriae</pl>, <pl id='Q11909406'>Boeae</pl>, <pl id='Q11955563'>Zarax</pl>, <pl id='Q12877135'>Epidaurus Limera</pl>, <pl id='Q4957784'>Brasiae</pl>, <pl id='Q15890352'>Geronthrae</pl> and <pl id='Q48781575'>Marios</pl>. These are all that are left to the <prn id='Q3556008'>Free Laconians</prn> out of twenty-four cities which once were theirs. All the other cities with which my narrative will deal belong, it must be remembered, to <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>, and are not independent like those I have already mentioned. </p>
<p id='3.21.8'><b>3.21.8</b> The people of <pl id='Q56398303'>Gythium</pl> say that their city had no human founder, but that <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> and <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, when they were reconciled after their strife for the possession of the tripod, united to found the city. In the agora they have images of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> and of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, and a <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> stands near them. In another part of the city are <prn id='Q671534'>Carnean</prn> <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, a sanctuary of <prn id='Q3575327'>Ammon</prn> and a bronze image of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>, whose temple is roofless, a spring belonging to the god, a holy sanctuary of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> and an image of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> <prn id='Q106517783'>Gaiaochos</prn> (Earthholder). </p>
<p id='3.21.9'><b>3.21.9</b> Him whom the people of <pl id='Q56398303'>Gythium</pl> name <prn id='Q7084465'>Old Man</prn>, saying that he lives in the sea, I found to be <prn id='Q189527'>Nereus</prn>. They got this name originally from <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>, who says in a part of the <prn id='Q8275'>Iliad</prn>, where <prn id='Q184437'>Thetis</prn> is speaking: <br>“Into the broad expanse, and into the bosom of ocean <r>Plunge, to behold the <prn id='Q7084465'>Old Man of the Sea</prn> and the home of your father.” <br>Here is also a gate called the Gate of <prn id='Q11294144'>Castor</prn>, and on the acropolis have been built a temple and image of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.22.1'><b>3.22.1</b> Just about three stades from <pl id='Q56398303'>Gythium</pl> is an unwrought stone. Legend has it that when <prn id='Q192407'>Orestes</prn> sat down upon it his madness left him. For this reason the stone was named in the <prn id='Q285494'>Dorian</prn> tongue <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> Cappotas. Before <pl id='Q56398303'>Gythium</pl> lies the island <pl id='Q5181876'>Cranae</pl>, and <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> says that when <prn id='Q167646'>Alexander</prn> had carried off <prn id='Q164061'>Helen</prn> he had intercourse with her there for the first time. On the mainland opposite the island is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> <prn id='Q107247932'>Migonitis</prn> (Union), and the whole place is called Migonium. </p>
<p id='3.22.2'><b>3.22.2</b> This sanctuary, they say, was made by <prn id='Q167646'>Alexander</prn>. But when <prn id='Q171839'>Menelaus</prn> had taken <pl id='Q22647'>Ilium</pl> and had returned safe home eight years after the sack of <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl>, he set up near the sanctuary of <prn id='Q107247932'>Migonitis</prn> an image of <prn id='Q184437'>Thetis</prn> and the goddesses <prn id='Q2250469'>Praxidicae</prn> (Exacters of Justice). Above Migonium is a mountain called <prn id='Q16328367'>Larysium</prn> sacred to <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>, and at the beginning of spring they hold a festival in honor of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>, and among the things they say about the ritual is that they find here a ripe bunch of grapes. </p>
<p id='3.22.3'><b>3.22.3</b> Some thirty stades beyond <pl id='Q56398303'>Gythium</pl> on the left there are on the mainland walls of a place called <pl id='Q60792067'>Trinasus</pl> (Three Islands), which was in my opinion a fort and not a city. Its name I think is derived from the islets which lie off the coast here, three in number. About eighty stades beyond <pl id='Q60792067'>Trinasus</pl> I came to the ruins of <pl id='Q56670610'>Helos</pl>, </p>
<p id='3.22.4'><b>3.22.4</b> and some thirty stades farther is <pl id='Q25858222'>Acriae</pl>, a city on the coast. Well worth seeing here are a temple and marble image of the <prn id='Q334486'>Mother of the Gods</prn>. The people of <pl id='Q25858222'>Acriae</pl> say that this is the oldest sanctuary of this goddess in the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl>, although the <pl id='Q920866'>Magnesians</pl>, who live to the north of Mount <pl id='Q532698'>Sipylus</pl>, have on the rock Coddinus the most ancient of all the images of the <prn id='Q334486'>Mother</prn> of the gods. The <pl id='Q920866'>Magnesians</pl> say that it was made by <prn id='Q850078'>Broteas</prn> the son of <prn id='Q182101'>Tantalus</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.22.5'><b>3.22.5</b> The people of <pl id='Q25858222'>Acriae</pl> once produced an <pl id='Q38888'>Olympian</pl> victor, <prn id='Q20671233'>Nicocles</prn>, who at two <pl id='Q38888'>Olympian</pl> festivals carried off five prizes for running. There has been raised to him a monument between the gymnasium and the wall by the harbor. </p>
<p id='3.22.6'><b>3.22.6</b> A hundred and twenty stades inland from <pl id='Q25858222'>Acriae</pl> is <pl id='Q15890352'>Geronthrae</pl>. It was inhabited before the <prn id='Q828084'>Heracleidae</prn> came to <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl>, but the <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn> of <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl> expelled the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaean</pl> inhabitants and afterwards sent to it settlers of their own; but in my time it belonged to the <prn id='Q3556008'>Free Laconians</prn>. On the road from <pl id='Q25858222'>Acriae</pl> to <pl id='Q15890352'>Geronthrae</pl> is a village called <pl id='Q48781617'>Palaea</pl> (Old), and in <pl id='Q15890352'>Geronthrae</pl> itself are a temple and grove of <prn id='Q40901'>Ares</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.22.7'><b>3.22.7</b> Every year they hold a festival in honor of the God, at which women are forbidden to enter the grove. Around the agora are their springs of drinking-water. On the acropolis is a temple of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> with the head of an ivory image. The rest of the image was destroyed by fire along with the former temple. </p>
<p id='3.22.8'><b>3.22.8</b> <pl id='Q48781575'>Marios</pl> is another town of the <prn id='Q3556008'>Free Laconians</prn>, distant from <pl id='Q15890352'>Geronthrae</pl> one hundred stades. Here is an ancient sanctuary common to all the gods, and around it is a grove containing springs. In a sanctuary of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> also there are springs. In fact <pl id='Q48781575'>Marios</pl> has an unsurpassed supply of water. Above the town, and like it in the interior, is a village, <pl id='Q48781593'>Glyppia</pl>. From <pl id='Q15890352'>Geronthrae</pl> to another village, <pl id='Q40648366'>Selinus</pl>, is a journey of twenty stades. </p>

By the sea is a city <pl id='Q12874174'>Asopus</pl>, sixty stades distant from <pl id='Q25858222'>Acriae</pl>. In it is a temple of the Roman emperors, and about twelve stades inland from the city is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>. They call the god <prn id='Q107349808'>Philolaus</prn>, and the bones in the gymnasium, which they worship, are human, although of superhuman size. On the acropolis is also a sanctuary of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, surnamed <prn id='Q59218037'>Cyparissia</prn> (Cypress Goddess). At the foot of the acropolis are the ruins of a city called the City of the Paracyparissian Achaeans. </p>

Two hundred stades from <pl id='Q12874174'>Asopus</pl> there juts out into the sea a headland, which they call <pl id='Q96408'>Onugnathus</pl> (Jaw of an Ass). Here is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, having neither image nor roof. <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn> is said to have made it. There is also the tomb of <prn id='Q105626153'>Cinadus</prn>, one of the pilots of the ship of <prn id='Q171839'>Menelaus</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.22.11'><b>3.22.11</b> After the peak there runs into the land the Gulf of <pl id='Q11909406'>Boeae</pl>, and the city of <pl id='Q11909406'>Boeae</pl> is at the head of the gulf. This was founded by <prn id='Q106516869'>Boeus</prn>, one of the <prn id='Q828084'>Heracleidae</prn>, and he is said to have collected inhabitants for it from three cities, <pl id='Q16652109'>Etis</pl>, <pl id='Q15223793'>Aphrodisias</pl> and <pl id='Q16631417'>Side</pl>. Of the ancient cities two are said to have been founded by <prn id='Q82732'>Aeneas</prn> when he was fleeing to <pl id='Q913582'>Italy</pl> and had been driven into this gulf by storms. <prn id='Q3733768'>Etias</prn>, they allege, was a daughter of <prn id='Q82732'>Aeneas</prn>. The third city they say was named after <prn id='Q106518547'>Side</prn>, daughter of <prn id='Q210883'>Danaus</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.22.12'><b>3.22.12</b> When the inhabitants of these cities were expelled, they were anxious to know where they ought to settle, and an oracle was given them that <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> would show them where they were to dwell. When therefore they had gone on shore, and a hare appeared to them, they looked upon the hare as their guide on the way. When it dived into a myrtle tree, they built a city on the site of the myrtle, and down to this day they worship that myrtle tree, and name <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> <prn id='Q2303797'>Saviour</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.22.13'><b>3.22.13</b> In the agora of <pl id='Q11909406'>Boeae</pl> is a temple of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, and in another part of the town are temples of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>, of <prn id='Q214554'>Serapis</prn>, and of <prn id='Q79876'>Isis</prn>. The ruins of <pl id='Q16652109'>Etis</pl> are not more than seven stades distant from <pl id='Q11909406'>Boeae</pl>. On the way to them there stands on the left a stone image of <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn>.

<p id='3.23.1'><b>3.23.1</b> <pl id='Q11855334'>Cythera</pl> lies opposite <pl id='Q11909406'>Boeae</pl>; to the promontory of Platanistus, the point where the island lies nearest to the mainland, it is a voyage of forty stades from a promontory on the mainland called <pl id='Q96408'>Onugnathus</pl>. In <pl id='Q11855334'>Cythera</pl> is a port <pl id='Q3475000'>Scandeia</pl> on the coast, but the town <pl id='Q11855334'>Cythera</pl> is about ten stades inland from <pl id='Q3475000'>Scandeia</pl>. The sanctuary of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> <prn id='Q423622'>Urania</prn> (the Heavenly) is most holy, and it is the most ancient of all the sanctuaries of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> among the Greeks. The goddess herself is represented by an armed <prn id='Q693222'>xoanon</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.23.2'><b>3.23.2</b> On the voyage from <pl id='Q11909406'>Boeae</pl> towards the point of <pl id='Q1471621'>Malea</pl> is a harbor called <pl id='Q60792072'>Nymphaeum</pl>, with a statue of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> standing, and a cave close to the sea; in it is a spring of sweet water. There is a large population in the district. After doubling the point of <pl id='Q1471621'>Malea</pl> and proceeding a hundred stades, you reach a place on the coast within the frontier of the <pl id='Q11909406'>Boeatae</pl>, which is sacred to <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> and called <pl id='Q60792070'>Epidelium</pl>. </p>
<p id='3.23.3'><b>3.23.3</b> For the <prn id='Q693222'>xoanon</prn> which is now here, once stood in <pl id='Q106802906'>Delos</pl>. <pl id='Q173148'>Delos</pl> was then a Greek market, and seemed to offer security to traders on account of the god; but as the place was unfortified and the inhabitants unarmed, <prn id='Q4290559'>Menophanes</prn>, an officer of <prn id='Q185126'>Mithridates</prn>, attacked it with a fleet, to show his contempt for the god, or acting on the orders of <prn id='Q185126'>Mithridates</prn>; for to a man whose object is gain what is sacred is of less account than what is profitable. </p>
<p id='3.23.4'><b>3.23.4</b> This <prn id='Q4290559'>Menophanes</prn> put to death the foreigners residing there and the <pl id='Q173148'>Delians</pl> themselves, and after plundering much property belonging to the traders and all the offerings, and also carrying women and children away as slaves, he razed <pl id='Q173148'>Delos</pl> itself to the ground. As it was being sacked and pillaged, one of the barbarians wantonly flung this <prn id='Q693222'>xoanon</prn> into the sea; but the wave took it and brought it to land here in the country of the <pl id='Q11909406'>Boeatae</pl>. For this reason they call the place <pl id='Q60792070'>Epidelium</pl>. </p>
<p id='3.23.5'><b>3.23.5</b> But neither <prn id='Q4290559'>Menophanes</prn> nor <prn id='Q185126'>Mithridates</prn> himself escaped the wrath of the god. <prn id='Q4290559'>Menophanes</prn>, as he was putting to sea after the sack of <pl id='Q173148'>Delos</pl> was sunk at once by those of the merchants who had escaped; for they lay in wait for him in ships. The god caused <prn id='Q185126'>Mithridates</prn> at a later date to lay hands upon himself, when his empire had been destroyed and he himself was being hunted on all sides by the Romans. There are some who say that he obtained a violent death as a favour at the hands of one of his mercenaries. This was the reward of their impiety. </p>
<p id='3.23.6'><b>3.23.6</b> The country of the <pl id='Q11909406'>Boeatae</pl> is adjoined by <pl id='Q12877135'>Epidaurus Limera</pl>, distant some two hundred stades from <pl id='Q60792070'>Epidelium</pl>. The people say that they are not descended from the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> but from the <pl id='Q233576'>Epidaurians</pl> of the <pl id='Q12649101'>Argolid</pl>, and that they touched at this point in <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconia</pl> when sailing on public business to <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> in <pl id='Q187027'>Cos</pl>. Warned by dreams that appeared to them, they remained and settled here. </p>
<p id='3.23.7'><b>3.23.7</b> They also say that a <prn id='Q2102'>snake</prn>, which they were bringing from their home in <pl id='Q233576'>Epidaurus</pl>, escaped from the ship, and disappeared into the ground not far from the sea. As a result of the portent of the <prn id='Q2102'>snake</prn> together with the vision in their dreams they resolved to remain and settle here. There are altars to <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> where the <prn id='Q2102'>snake</prn> disappeared, with olive trees growing round them. </p>
<p id='3.23.8'><b>3.23.8</b> About two stades to the right is the water of <prn id='Q223690'>Ino</prn>, as it is called, in extent like a small lake, but going deeper into the earth. Into this water they throw cakes of barley meal at the festival of <prn id='Q223690'>Ino</prn>. If good luck is portended to the thrower, the water keeps them under. But if it brings them to the surface, it is judged a bad sign. </p>
<p id='3.23.9'><b>3.23.9</b> The craters in <pl id='Q16990'>Aetna</pl> have the same feature; for they lower into them objects of gold and silver and also all kinds of victims. If the fire receives and consumes them, they rejoice at the appearance of a good sign, but if it casts up what has been thrown in, they think misfortune will befall the man to whom this happens. </p>
<p id='3.23.10'><b>3.23.10</b> By the road leading from <pl id='Q11909406'>Boeae</pl> to <pl id='Q12877135'>Epidaurus Limera</pl> is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> <prn id='Q106516710'>Limnatis</prn> in the country of the <pl id='Q12877135'>Epidaurians</pl>. The city lies on high ground, not far from the sea. Here the sanctuary of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> is worth seeing, also that of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> with a standing statue of stone, a temple of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> on the acropolis, and of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> with the title <prn id='Q2303797'>Saviour</prn> in front of the harbor. </p>
<p id='3.23.11'><b>3.23.11</b> A promontory called <pl id='Q654616'>Minoa</pl> projects into the sea near the town. The bay has nothing to distinguish it from all the other inlets of the sea in <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconia</pl>, but the beach here contains pebbles of prettier form and of all colors. </p>
<p id='3.24.1'><b>3.24.1</b> A hundred stades from <pl id='Q12877135'>Epidaurus</pl> is <pl id='Q11955563'>Zarax</pl>; though possessing a good harbor, it is the most ruinous of the towns of the <prn id='Q3556008'>Free Laconians</prn>, since it was the only town of theirs to be depopulated by <prn id='Q930518'>Cleonymus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q464632'>Cleomenes</prn>, son of <prn id='Q393079'>Agesipolis</prn>. I have told the story of <prn id='Q464632'>Cleomenes</prn> elsewhere. There is nothing in <pl id='Q11955563'>Zarax</pl> except a temple of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, with a statue holding a lyre, at the head of the harbor. </p>
<p id='3.24.2'><b>3.24.2</b> The road from <pl id='Q11955563'>Zarax</pl> follows the coast for about a hundred stades, and there strikes inland. After an ascent of ten stades inland are the ruins of the so-called <pl id='Q16549019'>Cyphanta</pl>, among which is a cave sacred to <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>; the image is of stone. There is a fountain of cold water springing from the rock, where they say that <prn id='Q190323'>Atalanta</prn>, distressed by thirst when hunting, struck the rock with her spear, so that the water gushed forth. </p>
<p id='3.24.3'><b>3.24.3</b> <pl id='Q4957784'>Brasiae</pl> is the last town on the coast belonging to the <prn id='Q3556008'>Free Laconians</prn> in this direction. It is distant two hundred stades by sea from <pl id='Q16549019'>Cyphanta</pl>. The inhabitants have a story, found nowhere else in Greece, that <prn id='Q776139'>Semele</prn>, after giving birth to her son by <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, was discovered by <prn id='Q27613'>Cadmus</prn> and put with <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> into a chest, which was washed up by the waves in their country. <prn id='Q776139'>Semele</prn>, who was no longer alive when found, received a splendid funeral, but they brought up <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.24.4'><b>3.24.4</b> For this reason the name of their city, hitherto called Oreiatae, was changed to <pl id='Q4957784'>Brasiae</pl> after the washing up of the chest to land; so too in our time the common word used of the waves casting things ashore is ekbrazein. The people of <pl id='Q4957784'>Brasiae</pl> add that <prn id='Q223690'>Ino</prn> in the course of her wanderings came to the country, and agreed to become the nurse of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>. They show the cave where <prn id='Q223690'>Ino</prn> nursed him, and call the plain the garden of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.24.5'><b>3.24.5</b> The temples here are those of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> and of <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn>, in whose honor they hold an annual festival. There is a small promontory at <pl id='Q4957784'>Brasiae</pl>, which projects gently into the sea; on it stand bronze figures, not more than a foot high, with caps on their heads. I am not sure whether they consider them to be <prn id='Q190103'>Dioscuri</prn> or <prn id='Q631406'>Corybants</prn>. They are three in number; a statue of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> makes a fourth. </p>
<p id='3.24.6'><b>3.24.6</b> [NEW ITINERARY] To the right of <pl id='Q56398303'>Gythium</pl> is <pl id='Q7142558'>Las</pl>, ten stades from the sea and forty from <pl id='Q56398303'>Gythium</pl>. The site of the present town extends over the ground between the mountains called IliusYY, Asia and Cnacadium; formerly it lay on the summit of Mount Asia. Even now there are ruins of the old town, with a statue of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> outside the walls, and a trophy for a victory over the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl>. These formed a detachment of <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn>'s army, when he invaded <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconia</pl>, but were separated from the main body and were plundering the coastal districts. </p>
<p id='3.24.7'><b>3.24.7</b> Among the ruins is a temple of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> named <prn id='Q55791586'>Asia</prn>, made, it is said, by <prn id='Q190103'>Polydeuces</prn> and <prn id='Q11294144'>Castor</prn> on their return home from <pl id='Q183150'>Colchis</pl>; for the <pl id='Q183150'>Colchians</pl> had a shrine of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> <prn id='Q55791586'>Asia</prn>. I know that the sons of <prn id='Q192946'>Tyndareus</prn> took part in <prn id='Q176758'>Jason</prn>'s expedition. As to the <pl id='Q183150'>Colchians</pl> honoring <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> <prn id='Q55791586'>Asia</prn>, I give what I heard from the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. Near the present town is a spring called Galaco (Milky) from the color of the water, and beside the spring a gymnasium, which contains an ancient statue of <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.24.8'><b>3.24.8</b> On Mount IliusYY is a temple of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>, and of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> at the very summit. On Cnacadium is an <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> called <prn id='Q671534'>Carneius</prn>. Some thirty stades from the <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> is a place Hypsoi, within the <pl id='Q5690'>Spartan</pl> frontier. Here is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> and of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> called <prn id='Q59578543'>Daphnaea</prn> (of the laurel). </p>
<p id='3.24.9'><b>3.24.9</b> By the sea is a temple of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> <prn id='Q59876222'>Dictynna</prn> on a promontory, in whose honor they hold an annual festival. A river Smenus reaches the sea to the left of the promontory; its water is extremely sweet to drink; its sources are in Mount <pl id='Q515809'>Taygetus</pl>, and it passes within five stades of the town. </p>
<p id='3.24.10'><b>3.24.10</b> At a spot called Arainon is the tomb of <prn id='Q3827232'>Las</prn> with a statue upon it. The natives say that <prn id='Q3827232'>Las</prn> was their founder and was killed by <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn>, and that <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn> put in to their country to ask the hand of <prn id='Q164061'>Helen</prn> of <prn id='Q192946'>Tyndareus</prn>. In point of fact it was <prn id='Q186271'>Patroclus</prn> who killed <prn id='Q3827232'>Las</prn>, for it was he who was <prn id='Q164061'>Helen</prn>'s suitor. We need not regard it as a proof that <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn> did not ask for <prn id='Q164061'>Helen</prn> because he is not mentioned in the <prn id='Q1233074'>Catalogue of Women</prn> as one of her suitors. </p>
<p id='3.24.11'><b>3.24.11</b> But at the beginning of his poem <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> says that <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn> came to <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl> as a favour to the sons of <prn id='Q192469'>Atreus</prn>, and not because he was bound by the oaths which <prn id='Q192946'>Tyndareus</prn> exacted; and in the Games he makes <prn id='Q577552'>Antilochus</prn> say that <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn> was a generation older than he, whereas <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn>, telling <prn id='Q496595'>Alcinous</prn> of his descent to <pl id='Q1521549'>Hades</pl> and other adventures, said that he wished to see <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> and <prn id='Q502156'>Peirithous</prn>, men of an earlier age. We know that <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> carried off <prn id='Q164061'>Helen</prn>, so that it is quite impossible that <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn> could have been her suitor. </p>
<p id='3.25.1'><b>3.25.1</b> Beyond the tomb a river named Scyras enters the sea.

That <prn id='Q464091'>Silenus</prn> was brought up in <pl id='Q1471621'>Malea</pl> is clear from these words in an ode of <prn id='Q134929'>Pindar</prn>: The mighty one, the dancer, whom the mount of <pl id='Q1471621'>Malea</pl> nurtured, husband of <prn id='Q106515828'>Nais</prn>, <prn id='Q464091'>Silenus</prn>.” Not that <prn id='Q134929'>Pindar</prn> said his name was <prn id='Q7263744'>Pyrrhichus</prn>; that is a statement of the men of <pl id='Q1471621'>Malea</pl>. </p>

The sanctuaries of the gods, that they have in the country, are of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, called <prn id='Q55833268'>Astrateia</prn>, because the <prn id='Q134154'>Amazons</prn> stayed their advance (strateia) here, and an <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> <prn id='Q4740901'>Amazonius</prn>.

Later poets gave the name <prn id='Q83496'>Cerberus</prn>, and though in other respects they made him resemble a <prn id='Q83496'>dog</prn>, they say that he had three heads. <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>, however, does not imply that he was a <prn id='Q83496'>dog</prn>, the friend of man, any more than if he had called a real <prn id='Q2102'>serpent</prn> the <prn id='Q83496'>hound of Hades</prn>. </p>
<p id='3.25.7'><b>3.25.7</b> Among other offerings on <pl id='Q33119266'>Taenarum</pl> is a bronze statue of <prn id='Q312422'>Arion</prn> the harper on a <prn id='Q7369'>dolphin</prn>. <prn id='Q26825'>Herodotus</prn> has told the story of <prn id='Q312422'>Arion</prn> and the <prn id='Q7369'>dolphin</prn>, as he heard it, in his history of <pl id='Q620765'>Lydia</pl>. I have seen the <prn id='Q7369'>dolphin</prn> at <pl id='Q6011695'>Poroselene</pl> that rewards the boy for saving his life. It had been damaged by fishermen and he cured it.

<p id='3.25.8'><b>3.25.8</b> There is a spring also on <pl id='Q849911'>Taenarum</pl> but now it possesses nothing marvellous. Formerly, as they say, it showed harbors and ships to those who looked into the water. These sights in the water were brought to an end for good and all by a woman washing dirty clothes in it. </p>
<p id='3.25.9'><b>3.25.9</b> From the point of <pl id='Q849911'>Taenarum</pl> <pl id='Q29788547'>Caenepolis</pl> is distant forty stades by sea. Its name also was formerly Taenarum. In it is a megaron of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>, and a temple of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> on the shore, with a standing statue of stone. Thirty stades distant is Thyrides, a headland of <pl id='Q33119266'>Taenarum</pl>, with the ruins of a city <pl id='Q60790133'>Hippola</pl>; among them is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> <prn id='Q107246944'>Hippolaitis</prn>.

<p id='3.25.10'><b>3.25.10</b> From this harbor it is 150 stades to <pl id='Q11921115'>Oetylus</pl>.

In <pl id='Q11921115'>Oetylus</pl> the sanctuary of <prn id='Q214554'>Sarapis</prn>, and in the agora a <prn id='Q693222'>xoanon</prn> of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> <prn id='Q671534'>Carneius</prn> are worth seeing. </p>
<p id='3.26.1'><b>3.26.1</b> From <pl id='Q11921115'>Oetylus</pl> to <pl id='Q16643340'>Thalamae</pl> the road is about eighty stades long. On it is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q223690'>Ino</prn> and an oracle. They consult the oracle in sleep, and the goddess reveals whatever they wish to learn, in dreams. Bronze statues of <prn id='Q203236'>Pasiphae</prn> and of <prn id='Q134270'>Helios</prn> stand in the unroofed part of the sanctuary. It was not possible to see the one within the temple clearly, owing to the garlands, but they say this too is of bronze. Water, sweet to drink, flows from a sacred spring. <prn id='Q203236'>Pasiphae</prn> is a title of the <prn id='Q131585'>Moon</prn>, and is not a local goddess of the people of <pl id='Q16643340'>Thalamae</pl>. </p>
<p id='3.26.2'><b>3.26.2</b> Twenty stades from <pl id='Q16643340'>Thalamae</pl> is a place called <pl id='Q16617755'>Pephnus</pl> on the coast. In front of it lies a small island no larger than a big rock, also called Pephnus. The people of <pl id='Q16643340'>Thalamae</pl> say that the <prn id='Q190103'>Dioscuri</prn> were born here. I know that <prn id='Q298850'>Alcman</prn> too says this in a song: but they do not say that they remained to be brought up in <pl id='Q16617755'>Pephnus</pl>, but that it was <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> who took them to <pl id='Q2010159'>Pellana</pl>. </p>
<p id='3.26.3'><b>3.26.3</b> In this little island there are bronze statues of the <prn id='Q190103'>Dioscuri</prn>, a foot high, in the open air. The sea will not move them, though in winter-time it washes over the rock, which is wonderful. Also the ants here have a whiter color than is usual. The <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> say that this district was originally theirs, and so they think that the <prn id='Q190103'>Dioscuri</prn> belong to them rather than to the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. </p>
<p id='3.26.4'><b>3.26.4</b> Twenty stades from <pl id='Q16617755'>Pephnus</pl> is <pl id='Q11931799'>Leuctra</pl>. I do not know why the city has this name. If indeed it is derived from <prn id='Q2316900'>Leucippus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q342343'>Perieres</prn>, as the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> say, it is for this reason, I think, that the inhabitants honor <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> most of the gods, supposing him to be the son of <prn id='Q9160370'>Arsinoe</prn> the daughter of <prn id='Q2316900'>Leucippus</prn>. There is a stone statue of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>, and of <prn id='Q223690'>Ino</prn> in another place. </p>

Water flows through the grove in winter-time, but the leaves which are shaken from the trees by the wind would not be carried away by the water even in flood. </p>
<p id='3.26.6'><b>3.26.6</b> I record an event which I know to have taken place in my time on the coast of <pl id='Q11931799'>Leuctra</pl>. A fire carried by the wind into a wood destroyed most of the trees, and when the place showed bare, a statue of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q107247012'>Ithomatas</prn> was found to have been dedicated there. The <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> say that this is evidence that <pl id='Q11931799'>Leuctra</pl> was formerly a part of <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl>. But it is possible, if the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> originally lived in <pl id='Q11931799'>Leuctra</pl>, that <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q107247012'>Ithomatas</prn> might be worshipped among them. </p>

It is eight stades from the sea and sixty from <pl id='Q11931799'>Leuctra</pl>. Here not far from the beach is a precinct sacred to the daughters of <prn id='Q189527'>Nereus</prn>. They say that they came up from the sea to this spot to see <prn id='Q322639'>Pyrrhus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn>, when he was going to <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> to wed <prn id='Q658523'>Hermione</prn>.

By <prn id='Q674319'>Machaon</prn> men may find cures for diseases.

The author of the epic The <prn id='Q2087365'>Little Iliad</prn> says that <prn id='Q674319'>Machaon</prn> was killed by <prn id='Q120831'>Eurypylus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q916442'>Telephus</prn>. </p>

It is said that the bones of <prn id='Q674319'>Machaon</prn> were brought home by <prn id='Q193267'>Nestor</prn>, but that <prn id='Q1071946'>Podaleirius</prn>, as they were returning after the sack of <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl>, was carried out of his course and reached <pl id='Q65066296'>Syrnus</pl> on the <pl id='Q193214'>Carian</pl> mainland in safety and settled there. </p>

<p id='4.1.1'><b>4.1.1</b> BOOK 4 <br>The frontier between <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl> and that part of it which was incorporated by the emperor in <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconia</pl> towards <pl id='Q5550565'>Gerenia</pl> is formed in our time by the valley called <pl id='Q25023367'>Choerius</pl>. They say that this country, being unoccupied, received its first inhabitants in the following manner: On the death of <prn id='Q1419059'>Lelex</prn>, who ruled in the present <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconia</pl>, then called after him Lelegia, <prn id='Q1956649'>Myles</prn>, the elder of his sons, received the kingdom. <prn id='Q2102913'>Polycaon</prn> was the younger and for this reason a private person, until he took to wife <prn id='Q1924155'>Messene</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q11704754'>Triopas</prn>, son of <prn id='Q1085790'>Phorbas</prn>, from <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.1.2'><b>4.1.2</b> <prn id='Q1924155'>Messene</prn>, being proud of her origin, for her father was the chief of the Greeks of his day in reputation and power, was not content that her husband should be a private person. They collected a force from <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> and from <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl> and came to this country, the whole land receiving the name <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl> from the wife of <prn id='Q2102913'>Polycaon</prn>. Together with other cities, they founded <pl id='Q2537068'>Andania</pl>, where their palace was built. </p>
<p id='4.1.3'><b>4.1.3</b> Before the battle which the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> fought with the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> at <pl id='Q2606004'>Leuctra</pl>, and the foundation of the present city of <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl> under <pl id='Q602538'>Ithome</pl>, I think that no city had the name <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl>. I base this conclusion principally on <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>'s lines. In the catalogue of those who came to <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl> he enumerated <pl id='Q2047396'>Pylos</pl>, <pl id='Q3558588'>Arene</pl> and other towns, but called no town <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl>. In the <prn id='Q35160'>Odyssey</prn> he shows that the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> were a tribe and not a city by the following: “For <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> men carried away <prn id='Q7368'>sheep</prn> from Ithaca.” 21.18 </p>
<p id='4.1.4'><b>4.1.4</b> He is still more clear when speaking about the bow of <prn id='Q1672196'>Iphitus</prn>: “They met one another in <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl> in the dwelling of <prn id='Q1446575'>Ortilochus</prn>.” By the dwelling of <prn id='Q1446575'>Ortilochus</prn> he meant the city of <pl id='Q1571214'>Pherae</pl> in <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl>, and explained this himself in the visit of <prn id='Q1766777'>Peisistratus</prn> to <prn id='Q171839'>Menelaus</prn>: “They came to <pl id='Q1571214'>Pherae</pl> to the house of <prn id='Q1226883'>Diocles</prn>, son of <prn id='Q1446575'>Ortilochus</prn>.” </p>

It was to her that <prn id='Q4207037'>Caucon</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q106624763'>Celaenus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q106624735'>Phlyus</prn>, brought the rites of the <prn id='Q30025797'>Great Goddesses</prn> from <pl id='Q94299853'>Eleusis</pl>. <prn id='Q106624735'>Phlyus</prn> himself is said by the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> to have been the son of <prn id='Q93172'>Earth</prn>, and the hymn of <prn id='Q728059'>Musaeus</prn> to <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> made for the <prn id='Q31789671'>Lycomidae</prn> agrees. </p>
<p id='4.1.6'><b>4.1.6</b> But the mysteries of the <prn id='Q30025797'>Great Goddesses</prn> were raised to greater honor many years later than <prn id='Q4207037'>Caucon</prn> by <prn id='Q1200671'>Lycus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q1076578'>Pandion</prn>, an oak-wood, where he purified the celebrants, being still called <prn id='Q1200671'>Lycus</prn>' wood. That there is a wood in this land so called is stated by <prn id='Q2319055'>Rhianus</prn> the <pl id='Q4752820'>Cretan</pl>: “By rugged Elaeum above <prn id='Q1200671'>Lycus</prn>' wood. </p>
<p id='4.1.7'><b>4.1.7</b> That this <prn id='Q1200671'>Lycus</prn> was the son of <prn id='Q1076578'>Pandion</prn> is made clear by the lines on the statue of <prn id='Q31789673'>Methapus</prn>, who made certain improvements in the mysteries. <prn id='Q31789673'>Methapus</prn> was an <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> by birth, an expert in the mysteries and founder of all kinds of rites. It was he who established the <pl id='Q15206356'>mysteries</pl> of the <prn id='Q940138'>Cabiri</prn> at <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>, and dedicated in the hut of the <prn id='Q31789671'>Lycomidae</prn> a statue with an inscription that amongst other things helps to confirm my account: </p>
<p id='4.1.8'><b>4.1.8</b> “I sanctified houses of <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> and paths of holy <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> and <prn id='Q45967'>Kore</prn> her firstborn, where they say that <prn id='Q1924155'>Messene</prn> established the feast of the <prn id='Q30025797'>Great Goddesses</prn>, taught by <prn id='Q4207037'>Caucon</prn>, sprung from <prn id='Q106624735'>Phlyus</prn>' noble son. And I wondered that <prn id='Q1200671'>Lycus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q1076578'>Pandion</prn>, brought all the <pl id='Q122443'>Attic</pl> rite to wise <pl id='Q2537068'>Andania</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.1.9'><b>4.1.9</b> This inscription shows that <prn id='Q4207037'>Caucon</prn> who came to <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl> was a descendant of <prn id='Q106624735'>Phlyus</prn>, and proves my other statements with regard to <prn id='Q1200671'>Lycus</prn>, and that the mysteries were originally at <pl id='Q2537068'>Andania</pl>. And it seems natural to me that <prn id='Q1924155'>Messene</prn> should have established the mysteries where she and <prn id='Q2102913'>Polycaon</prn> lived, not anywhere else. </p>
<p id='4.2.1'><b>4.2.1</b> As I was extremely anxious to learn what children were born to <prn id='Q2102874'>Polycaon</prn> by <prn id='Q1924155'>Messene</prn>, I read the poem called <prn id='Q1233074'>Eoeae</prn> and the epic <prn id='Q3337166'>Naupactia</prn>, and in addition to these all the genealogies of <prn id='Q726952'>Cinaethon</prn> and <prn id='Q730625'>Asius</prn>. However, they made no reference to this matter, although I know that the <prn id='Q1233074'>Great Eoeae</prn> says that <prn id='Q2102874'>Polycaon</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q1301972'>Butes</prn>, married <prn id='Q17376007'>Euaichme</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q847268'>Hyllus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, but it omits all reference to the husband of <prn id='Q1924155'>Messene</prn> and to <prn id='Q1924155'>Messene</prn> herself. </p>
<p id='4.2.2'><b>4.2.2</b> Some time later, as no descendant of <prn id='Q2102913'>Polycaon</prn> survived (in my opinion his house lasted for five generations, but no more), they summoned <prn id='Q342343'>Perieres</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q406388'>Aeolus</prn>, as king. To him, the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> say, came <prn id='Q1996222'>Melaneus</prn>, a good archer and considered for this reason to be a son of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>; <prn id='Q342343'>Perieres</prn> assigned to him as a dwelling a part of the country now called the <pl id='Q28000806'>Carnasium</pl>, but which then received the name <pl id='Q60790408'>Oechalia</pl>, derived, as they say, from the wife of <prn id='Q1996222'>Melaneus</prn>. </p>
<p id='4.2.3'><b>4.2.3</b> Most matters of Greek history have come to be disputed. The <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessalians</pl> say that Eurytium, which today is not inhabited, was formerly a city and was called <prn id='Q27926189'>Oechalia</prn>. The account given by the <pl id='Q173096'>Euboeans</pl> agrees with the statements of <prn id='Q608224'>Creophylus</prn> in his Heracleia; and <prn id='Q242270'>Hecataeus</prn> of <pl id='Q169460'>Miletus</pl> stated that <pl id='Q112743967'>Oechalia</pl> is in SciusYY, a part of the territory of <pl id='Q16562724'>Eretria</pl>. Nevertheless, I think that the whole version of the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> is more probable than these, particularly on account of the bones of <prn id='Q939149'>Eurytus</prn>, which my story will deal with later. </p>
<p id='4.2.4'><b>4.2.4</b> <prn id='Q342343'>Perieres</prn> had issue by <prn id='Q950523'>Gorgophone</prn> the daughter of <prn id='Q130832'>Perseus</prn>, <prn id='Q578378'>Aphareus</prn> and <prn id='Q2316900'>Leucippus</prn>, and after his death they inherited the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> kingdom. But <prn id='Q578378'>Aphareus</prn> had the greater authority.

<p id='4.2.5'><b>4.2.5</b> <prn id='Q578378'>Aphareus</prn> then founded the city of <pl id='Q3558588'>Arena</pl> in <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl>, and received into his house his cousin <prn id='Q637955'>Neleus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q869665'>Cretheus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q406388'>Aeolus</prn> (he was also called a son of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>), when he was driven from <pl id='Q662613'>Iolcos</pl> by <prn id='Q182439'>Pelias</prn>. He gave him the maritime part of the land, where with other towns was <pl id='Q2047396'>Pylos</pl>, in which <prn id='Q637955'>Neleus</prn> settled and established his palace. </p>

This has already formed a part of my account of <prn id='Q2803572'>Tisamenus</prn>. I will only add the following: When the <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn> assigned <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> to <prn id='Q636796'>Temenus</prn>, <prn id='Q1788026'>Cresphontes</prn> asked them for the land of <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl>, in that he was older than <prn id='Q666525'>Aristodemus</prn>. </p>
<p id='4.3.4'><b>4.3.4</b> <prn id='Q666525'>Aristodemus</prn> was now dead, but <prn id='Q1788026'>Cresphontes</prn> was vigorously opposed by <prn id='Q603759'>Theras</prn> the son of <prn id='Q784528'>Autesion</prn>, who was of <pl id='Q11225429'>Theban</pl> origin and fourth in descent from <prn id='Q334817'>Polyneices</prn> the son of <prn id='Q130890'>Oedipus</prn>. He was at that time guardian of the sons of <prn id='Q666525'>Aristodemus</prn>, being their uncle on the mother's side, <prn id='Q666525'>Aristodemus</prn> having married a daughter of <prn id='Q784528'>Autesion</prn>, called <prn id='Q644374'>Argeia</prn>. <prn id='Q1788026'>Cresphontes</prn>, wishing to obtain <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl> as his portion at all costs, approached <prn id='Q636796'>Temenus</prn>, and having suborned him pretended to leave the decision to the lot. </p>
<p id='4.3.5'><b>4.3.5</b> <prn id='Q636796'>Temenus</prn> put the lots of the children of <prn id='Q666525'>Aristodemus</prn> and of <prn id='Q1788026'>Cresphontes</prn> into a jar containing water, the terms being that the party whose lot came up first should be the first to choose a portion of the country. <prn id='Q636796'>Temenus</prn> had caused both lots to be made of clay, but for the sons of <prn id='Q666525'>Aristodemus</prn> sun-dried, for <prn id='Q1788026'>Cresphontes</prn> baked with fire. So the lot of the sons of <prn id='Q666525'>Aristodemus</prn> was dissolved, and <prn id='Q1788026'>Cresphontes</prn>, winning in this way, chose <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.3.6'><b>4.3.6</b> The common people of the old <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> were not dispossessed by the <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn>, but agreed to be ruled by <prn id='Q1788026'>Cresphontes</prn> and to divide the land with the <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn>. They were induced to give way to them in this by the suspicion which they felt for their rulers, as the <prn id='Q6989963'>Neleidae</prn> were originally of <pl id='Q662613'>Iolcos</pl>. <prn id='Q1788026'>Cresphontes</prn> took to wife <prn id='Q1886507'>Merope</prn> the daughter of <prn id='Q1247318'>Cypselus</prn>, then king of the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl>, by whom with other children was born to him <prn id='Q406443'>Aepytus</prn> his youngest. </p>
<p id='4.3.7'><b>4.3.7</b> He had the palace, which he and his children were to occupy, built in <pl id='Q15829811'>Stenyclerus</pl>. Originally <prn id='Q342343'>Perieres</prn> and the other kings dwelt at <pl id='Q2537068'>Andania</pl>, but when <prn id='Q578378'>Aphareus</prn> founded <pl id='Q3558588'>Arene</pl>, he and his sons settled there.

As his government for the most part was directed in favour of the people, the rich rebelled and killed <prn id='Q1788026'>Cresphontes</prn> and all his sons except <prn id='Q406443'>Aepytus</prn>. </p>
<p id='4.3.8'><b>4.3.8</b> He was still a boy and being brought up by <prn id='Q430688'>Cypselus</prn>, and was the sole survivor of his house.

On becoming king, <prn id='Q406443'>Aepytus</prn> punished his father's murderers and all who had been accessories to the crime. By winning the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> nobles to his side by deference, and all who were of the people by gifts, he attained to such honor that his descendants were given the name of <prn id='Q106624449'>Aepytidae</prn> instead of <prn id='Q828084'>Heracleidae</prn>. </p>
<p id='4.3.9'><b>4.3.9</b> <prn id='Q838383'>Glaucus</prn>, <prn id='Q406443'>Aepytus</prn>'s son and successor, was content to imitate <prn id='Q406443'>Aepytus</prn> in all other matters, both publicly and in his treatment of individuals, but attained to greater piety. For the precinct of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> on the summit of <pl id='Q602538'>Ithome</pl>, having been consecrated by <prn id='Q2102913'>Polycaon</prn> and <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl>, had hitherto received no honor among the <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn>, and it was <prn id='Q838383'>Glaucus</prn> who established this worship among them and he was the first to sacrifice to <prn id='Q674319'>Machaon</prn> the son of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> in <pl id='Q5550565'>Gerenia</pl>, and to assign to <prn id='Q1924155'>Messene</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q2632716'>Triopas</prn>, the honors customarily paid to heroes. </p>
<p id='4.3.10'><b>4.3.10</b> <prn id='Q1638693'>Isthmius</prn> the son of <prn id='Q838383'>Glaucus</prn> built a shrine also to <prn id='Q1538180'>Gorgasus</prn> and <prn id='Q1723235'>Nicomachus</prn> which is in <pl id='Q1571214'>Pharae</pl>. <prn id='Q1638693'>Isthmius</prn> had a son <prn id='Q1251156'>Dotadas</prn>, who constructed the harbor at <pl id='Q60790706'>Mothone</pl>, though <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl> contained others. <prn id='Q1286112'>Sybotas</prn> the son of <prn id='Q1251156'>Dotadas</prn> established the annual sacrifice by the king to the river <pl id='Q3100663'>Pamisus</pl> and also the offering to the hero <prn id='Q939149'>Eurytus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q1996222'>Melaneus</prn> at <pl id='Q60790408'>Oechalia</pl> before the mysteries of the great Goddesses, which were still held at <pl id='Q2537068'>Andania</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.4.1'><b>4.4.1</b> In the reign of <prn id='Q3559805'>Phintas</prn> the son of <prn id='Q1286112'>Sybotas</prn> the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> for the first time sent an offering and chorus of men to <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> at <pl id='Q106802906'>Delos</pl>. Their processional hymn to the god was composed by <prn id='Q391254'>Eumelus</prn>, this poem being the only one of his that is considered genuine. It was in the reign of <prn id='Q3559805'>Phintas</prn> that a quarrel first took place with the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. The very cause is disputed, but is said to have been as follows: </p>
<p id='4.4.2'><b>4.4.2</b> There is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> called <pl id='Q107161014'>Limnatis</pl> (of the Lake) on the frontier of <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl>, in which the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> and the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> alone of the <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn> shared. According to the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> their maidens coming to the festival were violated by <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> men and their king was killed in trying to prevent it. He was <prn id='Q1258032'>Teleclus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q632592'>Archelaus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q393054'>Agesilaus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q1167892'>Doryssus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q1433820'>Labotas</prn>, son of <prn id='Q1280328'>Echestratus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q394074'>Agis</prn>. In addition to this they say that the maidens who were violated killed themselves for shame. </p>
<p id='4.4.3'><b>4.4.3</b> The <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> say that a plot was formed by <prn id='Q1258032'>Teleclus</prn> against persons of the highest rank in <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl> who had come to the <pl id='Q107161014'>sanctuary</pl>, his incentive being the excellence of the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> land; in furtherance of his design he selected some <pl id='Q5690'>Spartan</pl> youths, all without beards, dressed them in girls' clothes and ornaments, and providing them with daggers introduced them among the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> when they were resting; the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>, in defending themselves, killed the beardless youths and <prn id='Q1258032'>Teleclus</prn> himself; but the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, they say, whose king did not plan this without the general consent, being conscious that they had begun the wrong, did not demand justice for the murder of <prn id='Q1258032'>Teleclus</prn>. These are the accounts given by the two sides; one may believe them according to one's feelings towards either side. </p>
<p id='4.4.4'><b>4.4.4</b> A generation later in the reign of <prn id='Q1258989'>Alcamenes</prn> the son of <prn id='Q1258032'>Teleclus</prn> in <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl> — the king of the other house was <prn id='Q460405'>Theopompus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q2537646'>Nicander</prn>, son of <prn id='Q176022'>Charillus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q771241'>Polydectes</prn>, son of <prn id='Q2714687'>Eunomus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q2537664'>Prytanis</prn>, son of <prn id='Q1266363'>Eurypon</prn> in <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl> <prn id='Q4067043'>Antiochus</prn> and <prn id='Q5675384'>Androcles</prn>, the sons of <prn id='Q3559805'>Phintas</prn> were reigning — the mutual hatred of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> and <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> was aroused, and the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> began war, obtaining a pretext which was not only sufficient for them, eager for a quarrel as they were and resolved on war at all costs, but also plausible in the highest degree, although with a more peaceful disposition it could have been settled by the decision of a court. What happened was as follows. </p>
<p id='4.4.5'><b>4.4.5</b> There was a <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> <prn id='Q7226204'>Polychares</prn>, a man of no small distinction in all respects and an <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> victor. (The <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleians</pl> were holding the <prn id='Q57337658'>fourth Olympiad</prn> [764 BCE], the only event being the short foot-race, when <prn id='Q7226204'>Polychares</prn> won his victory.) This man, possessing <prn id='Q830'>cattle</prn> without land of his own to provide them with sufficient grazing, gave them to a <pl id='Q5690'>Spartan</pl> <prn id='Q88461412'>Euaephnus</prn> to feed on his own land, <prn id='Q88461412'>Euaephnus</prn> to have a share of the produce. </p>
<p id='4.4.6'><b>4.4.6</b> Now <prn id='Q88461412'>Euaephnus</prn> was a man who set unjust gain above loyalty, and a trickster besides. He sold the <prn id='Q830'>cattle</prn> of <prn id='Q7226204'>Polychares</prn> to some merchants who put in to <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconia</pl>, and went himself to inform <prn id='Q7226204'>Polychares</prn> but he said that <prn id='Q10729326'>pirates</prn> had landed in the country, had overcome him and carried off the <prn id='Q830'>cattle</prn> and the herdsmen. While he was trying to deceive him by his lies, one of the herdsmen, escaping in the meantime from the merchants, returned and found <prn id='Q88461412'>Euaephnus</prn> there with his master, and convicted him before <prn id='Q7226204'>Polychares</prn>. </p>
<p id='4.4.7'><b>4.4.7</b> Thus caught and unable to deny it, he made many appeals to <prn id='Q7226204'>Polychares</prn> himself and to his son to grant him pardon; for among the many inducements to be found in human nature which drive us to wrongdoing the love of gain exercises the greatest power. He stated the price which he had received for the <prn id='Q830'>cattle</prn> and begged that the son of <prn id='Q7226204'>Polychares</prn> should come with him to receive it. When on their way they reached <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconia</pl>, <prn id='Q88461412'>Euaephnus</prn> dared a deed more impious than the first; he murdered <prn id='Q7226204'>Polychares</prn>' son. </p>
<p id='4.4.8'><b>4.4.8</b> <prn id='Q7226204'>Polychares</prn>, when he heard of this new misfortune, went to <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl> and plagued the kings and ephors, loudly lamenting his son and recounting the wrongs that he had suffered from <prn id='Q88461412'>Euaephnus</prn>, whom he had made his friend and trusted above all the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. Obtaining no redress in spite of continual visits to the authorities, <prn id='Q7226204'>Polychares</prn> at last was driven out of his mind, gave way to his rage, and, regardless of himself, dared to murder every <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> whom he could capture. </p>
<p id='4.5.1'><b>4.5.1</b> The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> say that they went to war because <prn id='Q7226204'>Polychares</prn> was not surrendered to them, and on account of the murder of <prn id='Q1258032'>Teleclus</prn>; even before this they had been suspicious on account of the wrongdoing of <prn id='Q1788026'>Cresphontes</prn> in the matter of the lot. The <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> make the reply that I have already given with regard to <prn id='Q1258032'>Teleclus</prn>, and point to the fact that the sons of <prn id='Q666525'>Aristodemus</prn> helped to restore <prn id='Q406443'>Aepytus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q1788026'>Cresphontes</prn>, which they would never have done if they had been at variance with <prn id='Q1788026'>Cresphontes</prn>. </p>
<p id='4.5.2'><b>4.5.2</b> They say that they did not surrender <prn id='Q7226204'>Polychares</prn> to the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> for punishment because they also had not surrendered <prn id='Q88461412'>Euaephnus</prn>, but that they offered to stand trial at the meeting of the league before the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>, kinsmen of both parties, and to submit the matter to the court at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> called the <pl id='Q202487'>Areopagus</pl>, as this court was held to exercise an ancient jurisdiction in cases pertaining to murder. </p>
<p id='4.5.3'><b>4.5.3</b> They say that these were not the reasons of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> in going to war, but that they had formed designs on their country through covetousness, as in others of their actions, bringing forward against them their treatment of the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> and of the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>; for in both cases they have never been satisfied with their continual encroachments. When <prn id='Q184462'>Croesus</prn> sent them presents they were the first to become friends with the barbarian, after he had reduced the other Greeks of <prn id='Q51614'>Asia Minor</prn> and all the <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn> who live on the <pl id='Q193214'>Carian</pl> mainland. </p>
<p id='4.5.4'><b>4.5.4</b> They point out too that when the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocian</pl> leaders had seized the temple at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>, the kings and every <pl id='Q5690'>Spartan</pl> of repute privately, and the board of ephors and senate publicly, had a share of the god's property. As the most convincing proof that the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> would stick at nothing for the sake of gain, they reproach them with their alliance with <prn id='Q15872635'>Apollodorus</prn>, who became tyrant in <pl id='Q999468'>Cassandreia</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.5.5'><b>4.5.5</b> I could not introduce into the present account the reasons why the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> have come to regard this as so bitter a reproach. Although the courage of the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> and the length of time for which they fought differ from the facts of the tyranny of <prn id='Q15872635'>Apollodorus</prn>, in their disastrous character the sufferings of the people of <pl id='Q999468'>Cassandreia</pl> would not fall far short of the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.5.6'><b>4.5.6</b> These then are the reasons for the war which the two sides allege. An embassy then came from the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> to demand the surrender of <prn id='Q7226204'>Polychares</prn>. The <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> kings replied to the ambassadors that after deliberation with the people they would send the findings to <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> and after their departure they themselves summoned the citizens to a meeting. The views put forward differed widely, <prn id='Q5675384'>Androcles</prn> urging the surrender of <prn id='Q7226204'>Polychares</prn> as guilty of an impious and abominable crime. <prn id='Q4067043'>Antiochus</prn> among other arguments urged against him that it would be the most piteous thing that <prn id='Q7226204'>Polychares</prn> should suffer before the eyes of <prn id='Q88461412'>Euaephnus</prn>, and enumerated in detail all that he would have to undergo. </p>
<p id='4.5.7'><b>4.5.7</b> Finally the supporters of <prn id='Q5675384'>Androcles</prn> and of <prn id='Q4067043'>Antiochus</prn> were so carried away that they took up arms. But the battle did not last long, for the party of <prn id='Q4067043'>Antiochus</prn>, far outnumbering the other, killed <prn id='Q5675384'>Androcles</prn> and his principal supporters, <prn id='Q4067043'>Antiochus</prn>, now sole king, sent to <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> that he was ready to submit the matter to the courts which I have already mentioned. But the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> are said to have made no reply to the bearers of the letter. </p>
<p id='4.5.8'><b>4.5.8</b> Not many months later <prn id='Q4067043'>Antiochus</prn> died and his son <prn id='Q5850304'>Euphaes</prn> succeeded to the kingdom. The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, without sending a herald to declare war on the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> or renouncing their friendship beforehand, had made their preparations secretly and with all the concealment possible; they first took an oath that neither the length of the war, should it not be decided soon, nor their disasters, however great they might be, would deter them until they won the land of <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl> by the sword. </p>
<p id='4.5.9'><b>4.5.9</b> After taking this oath, they attacked <pl id='Q19760768'>Ampheia</pl> by night, appointing <prn id='Q1258989'>Alcamenes</prn> the son of <prn id='Q1258032'>Teleclus</prn> leader of the force. <pl id='Q19760768'>Ampheia</pl> is a small town in <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl> near the <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconian</pl> border, of no great size, but situated on a high hill and possessing copious springs of water. It seemed generally a suitable base for the whole war. The gates being open and the town not garrisoned, they took it and killed the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> captured there, some still in their beds and others who had taken refuge at the sanctuaries and altars of the gods when they realized what had happened. Those who escaped were few. </p>
<p id='4.5.10'><b>4.5.10</b> This was the first attack which the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> made on the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>, in the second year of the <prn id='Q57337666'>ninth Olympiad</prn> [743 BCE], when <prn id='Q8043552'>Xenodocus</prn> of <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl> won the short foot-race. In <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> there were not as yet the archons appointed annually by lot for at first the people deprived the descendants of <prn id='Q1255043'>Melanthus</prn>, called <prn id='Q106632597'>Medontidae</prn>, of most of their power, transforming the kingship into a constitutional office; afterwards they limited their tenure of office to ten years. At the time of the seizure of <pl id='Q19760768'>Ampheia</pl>, <prn id='Q90974187'>Aesimides</prn> the son of <prn id='Q12761989'>Aeschylus</prn> was holding his fifth year office at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.6.1'><b>4.6.1</b> Before I wrote the history of the war and all the sufferings and actions that heaven prepared in it for both sides, I wished to reach a decision regarding the age of a certain <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl>. This war was fought between the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> with their allies and the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> with their supporters, but received its name not from the invaders like the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl> and <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesian</pl> wars, but was called <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> from their disasters, just as the name <prn id='Q42937'>Trojan War</prn>, rather than Greek, came to be universally applied to the war at <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl>. An account of this war of the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> has been given by <prn id='Q2319055'>Rhianus</prn> of <pl id='Q65121666'>Bene</pl> in his epic, and by <prn id='Q3038231'>Myron</prn> of <pl id='Q142819'>Priene</pl>. <prn id='Q3038231'>Myron</prn>'s history is in prose. </p>
<p id='4.6.2'><b>4.6.2</b> Neither writer achieved a complete and continuous account of the whole war from its beginning to the end, but only of the part which each selected: <prn id='Q3038231'>Myron</prn> narrated the capture of <pl id='Q19760768'>Ampheia</pl> and subsequent events down to the death of <prn id='Q2709649'>Aristodemus</prn>; <prn id='Q2319055'>Rhianus</prn> did not touch this first war at all. He described the events that in time befell the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> after their revolt from the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, not indeed the whole of them, but those subsequent to the battle which they fought at the <prn id='Q3636289'>Great Trench</prn>, as it is called. </p>
<p id='4.6.3'><b>4.6.3</b> The <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl>, <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn>, on whose account I have made my whole mention of <prn id='Q2319055'>Rhianus</prn> and <prn id='Q3038231'>Myron</prn>, was the man who first and foremost raised the name of <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl> to renown. He was introduced by <prn id='Q3038231'>Myron</prn> into his history, while to <prn id='Q2319055'>Rhianus</prn> in his epic <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> is as great a man as is the <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn> of the <prn id='Q8275'>Iliad</prn> to <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>. As their statements differ so widely, it remained for me to adopt one or other of the accounts, but not both together, and <prn id='Q2319055'>Rhianus</prn> appeared to me to have given the more probable account as to the age of <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn>. </p>
<p id='4.6.4'><b>4.6.4</b> One may realize in others of his works that <prn id='Q3038231'>Myron</prn> gives no heed to the question of his statements seeming to lack truth and credibility, and particularly in this <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> history. For he has made <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> kill <prn id='Q460405'>Theopompus</prn>, the king of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, shortly before the death of <prn id='Q2709649'>Aristodemus</prn> but we know that <prn id='Q460405'>Theopompus</prn> was not killed either in battle or in any other way before the war was concluded. </p>
<p id='4.6.5'><b>4.6.5</b> It was this <prn id='Q460405'>Theopompus</prn> who put an end to the war, and my evidence is the lines of <prn id='Q316094'>Tyrtaeus</prn>, which say: “To our king beloved of the gods, <prn id='Q460405'>Theopompus</prn>, through whom we took <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl> with wide dancing-grounds. <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> then in my view belongs to the time of the second war, and I will relate his history when I come to this. </p>
<p id='4.6.6'><b>4.6.6</b> The <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>, when they heard of the events at <pl id='Q19760768'>Ampheia</pl> from the actual survivors from the captured town, mustered in <pl id='Q15829811'>Stenyclerus</pl> from their cities. When the people had gathered in the assembly, first the leading men and finally the king exhorted them not to be panic-stricken at the sack of <pl id='Q19760768'>Ampheia</pl>, or to suppose that the issue of the whole war had already been decided thereby, or to be afraid of the power of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> as superior to their own. For the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> had longer practice in warfare, but they themselves had a stronger necessity to show themselves brave men, and greater goodwill would be shown by the gods to men defending their country, who were not the authors of injustice. </p>
<p id='4.7.1'><b>4.7.1</b> With these words <prn id='Q5850304'>Euphaes</prn> dismissed the gathering, and henceforward kept all the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> under arms, compelling the untrained to learn the art of war and the trained men to undergo a more rigorous discipline than before. The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> carried out raids into <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl>, but did no harm to the country, regarding it as their own, nor did they cut down trees or demolish buildings, but they drove off any <prn id='Q830'>cattle</prn> that they met with, and carried off the corn and other produce. </p>
<p id='4.7.2'><b>4.7.2</b> They made assaults on the towns but captured none, as they were fortified with walls and carefully garrisoned. They withdrew with loss and without effecting anything, and finally gave up attempting the towns. The <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> also ravaged the <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconian</pl> coast and all the cultivated land round <pl id='Q515809'>Taygetos</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.7.3'><b>4.7.3</b> Three years after the capture of <pl id='Q19760768'>Ampheia</pl>, being eager to put to use the spirit of the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>, now at the height of their passion against the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, and considering too that they had undergone sufficient training, <prn id='Q5850304'>Euphaes</prn> ordered an advance. He bade the slaves also accompany him, bringing wood and all else that was required for the making of an entrenched camp. The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> heard from their garrison at <pl id='Q19760768'>Ampheia</pl> that the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> were marching out, so they also came out to battle. </p>
<p id='4.7.4'><b>4.7.4</b> There was a place in <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl> which was in other ways suitable for an engagement, but had a deep ravine in front of it. Here <prn id='Q5850304'>Euphaes</prn> drew up the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> and appointed <prn id='Q88465907'>Cleonnis</prn> general; the cavalry and light-armed, together amounting to less than 500, were commanded by <prn id='Q106632482'>Pytharatus</prn> and <prn id='Q121365916'>Antander</prn>. </p>
<p id='4.7.5'><b>4.7.5</b> As the two forces were about to engage, the ravine which divided them prevented the heavy-armed from coming to close quarters, though they approached one another eagerly and with a recklessness born of hate. The cavalry and light-armed engaged above the ravine, but as they were equally matched in numbers and skill, for this reason the fight was indecisive. </p>
<p id='4.7.6'><b>4.7.6</b> While they were involved, <prn id='Q5850304'>Euphaes</prn> ordered the slaves to fortify with a palisade first the rear of his force and afterwards both flanks, and when the battle had been broken off at nightfall, they fortified his front also on the ravine. So at daybreak the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> realized the forethought of <prn id='Q5850304'>Euphaes</prn>. They had no means of fighting the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> unless they came out from the stockade, and despaired of forming a siege, for which they were unprepared in all things alike. </p>
<p id='4.7.7'><b>4.7.7</b> They then returned home; but a year later, when the older men reviled them and taunted them both with cowardice and disregard of their oath, they made a second expedition openly against the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>. Both kings were in command, <prn id='Q460405'>Theopompus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q2537646'>Nicander</prn> and <prn id='Q1463572'>Polydorus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q1258989'>Alcamenes</prn>, <prn id='Q1258989'>Alcamenes</prn> being no longer alive. The <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> encamped opposite them, and when the <pl id='Q5690'>Spartans</pl> endeavored to join battle, went out to meet them. </p>
<p id='4.7.8'><b>4.7.8</b> The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> commander on the left wing was <prn id='Q1463572'>Polydorus</prn>, and <prn id='Q460405'>Theopompus</prn> on the right. The center was held by <prn id='Q11921265'>Euryleon</prn>, now a <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl>, but of <pl id='Q11225429'>Theban</pl> origin of the house of <prn id='Q27613'>Cadmus</prn>, fourth in descent from <prn id='Q4687553'>Aegeus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q923898'>Oeolycus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q603759'>Theras</prn>, son of <prn id='Q784528'>Autesion</prn>. On the side of the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> <prn id='Q121365916'>Antander</prn> and <prn id='Q5850304'>Euphaes</prn> were posted opposite the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> right; the other wing, opposite <prn id='Q1463572'>Polydorus</prn>, was held by <prn id='Q106632482'>Pytharatus</prn>, with <prn id='Q88465907'>Cleonnis</prn> in the center. </p>
<p id='4.7.9'><b>4.7.9</b> As they were about to engage, the kings came forward to encourage their men. The words of encouragement addressed by <prn id='Q460405'>Theopompus</prn> to the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> were few, according to their native custom. He reminded them of their oath against the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>, and said how noble was their ambition, to prove themselves to have done a deed more glorious than their fathers, who subdued the neighboring peoples, and to have won a more fortunate land. <prn id='Q5850304'>Euphaes</prn> spoke at greater length than the <pl id='Q5690'>Spartan</pl>, but no more than he saw the occasion admitted. </p>
<p id='4.7.10'><b>4.7.10</b> He declared that the contest would be not only for land and possessions, but he knew well what would overtake them if defeated. Their wives and children would be carried off as slaves, and death unaccompanied by outrage would be the mildest fate for their grown men their sanctuaries would be despoiled and their ancestral homes burnt. His words were not supposition, the fate of the men captured at <pl id='Q19760768'>Ampheia</pl> was evidence that all could see. </p>
<p id='4.7.11'><b>4.7.11</b> Better a noble death than such evils; it was far easier for them, while still undefeated and equally matched in courage, to outdo their adversaries in zeal than to repair their losses when once they had lost heart. </p>
<p id='4.8.1'><b>4.8.1</b> Such were the words of <prn id='Q5850304'>Euphaes</prn>. When the leaders on either side gave the signal, the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> charged the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> recklessly like men eager for death in their wrath, each one of them eager to be the first to join battle. The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> also advanced to meet them eagerly, but were careful not to break their ranks. </p>
<p id='4.8.2'><b>4.8.2</b> When they were about to come to close quarters, they threatened one another by brandishing their arms and with fierce looks, and fell to recriminations, these calling the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> already their slaves, no freer than the <prn id='Q462484'>Helots</prn>; the others answering that they were impious in their undertaking, who for the sake of gain attacked their kinsmen and outraged all the ancestral gods of the <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn>, and <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> above all. And now with their taunts they come to deeds, mass thrusting against mass, especially on the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> side, and man attacking man. </p>
<p id='4.8.3'><b>4.8.3</b> The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> were far superior both in tactics and training, and also in numbers, for they had with them the neighboring peoples already reduced and serving in their ranks, and the <pl id='Q11917781'>Dryopes</pl> of <pl id='Q1154474'>Asine</pl>, who a generation earlier had been driven out of their own country by the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> and had come as suppliants to <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl>, were forced to serve in the army. Against the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> light-armed they employed <pl id='Q4752820'>Cretan</pl> archers as mercenaries. </p>
<p id='4.8.4'><b>4.8.4</b> The <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> were inspired alike by desperation and readiness to face death, regarding all their sufferings as necessary rather than terrible to men who honored their country, and exaggerating their achievements and the consequences to the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. Some of them leapt forth from the ranks, displaying glorious deeds of valor, in others fatally wounded and scarce breathing the frenzy of despair still reigned. </p>
<p id='4.8.5'><b>4.8.5</b> They encouraged one another, the living and unwounded urging the stricken before their last moment came to sell their lives as dearly as they could and accept their fate with joy. And the wounded, when they felt their strength ebbing and breath failing, urged the unwounded to prove themselves no less valorous than they and not to render their death of no avail to their fatherland. </p>
<p id='4.8.6'><b>4.8.6</b> The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> refrained from exhorting one another, and were less inclined than the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> to engage in striking deeds of valor. As they were versed in warfare from boyhood, they employed a deeper formation and hoped that the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> would not endure the contest for so long as they, or sustain the toil of battle or wounds. </p>
<p id='4.8.7'><b>4.8.7</b> These were the differences in both sets of combatants in action and in feeling; but on both sides alike the conquered made no appeals or promises of ransom, perhaps in their enmity despairing of getting quarter, but mainly because they scorned to disgrace their previous achievements. The victorious refrained alike from boasting and from taunts, neither side having yet sure hopes of victory. The most remarkable was the death of those who tried to strip any of the fallen. For if they exposed any part of their bodies, they were struck with javelins or were struck down while intent on their present occupation, or were killed by those whom they were plundering who still lived. </p>
<p id='4.8.8'><b>4.8.8</b> The kings fought in a manner that deserves mention. <prn id='Q460405'>Theopompus</prn> rushed wildly forward to slay <prn id='Q5850304'>Euphaes</prn> himself. <prn id='Q5850304'>Euphaes</prn>, seeing him advancing, said to <prn id='Q121365916'>Antander</prn> that the action of <prn id='Q460405'>Theopompus</prn> was no different from the attempt of his ancestor <prn id='Q334817'>Polyneices</prn>; for <prn id='Q334817'>Polyneices</prn> led an army from <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> against his fatherland, and slaying his brother with his own hand was slain by him. <prn id='Q460405'>Theopompus</prn> was ready to involve the race of the <prn id='Q828084'>Heracleidae</prn> in pollution as great as that of the house of <prn id='Q463898'>Laius</prn> and <prn id='Q130890'>Oedipus</prn>, but he would not leave the field unscathed. With these words he too advanced. </p>
<p id='4.8.9'><b>4.8.9</b> Thereupon the battle, though the combatants had wearied, everywhere broke out again in full force. Their strength was renewed and recklessness of death heightened on both sides, so that it might have been thought that they were engaging for the first time. Finally <prn id='Q5850304'>Euphaes</prn> and his men in a frenzy of despair that was near to madness (for picked <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> troops formed the whole of the king's bodyguard), overpowering the enemy by their valor, drove back <prn id='Q460405'>Theopompus</prn> himself and routed the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> troops opposed to them. </p>
<p id='4.8.10'><b>4.8.10</b> But the other <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> wing was in difficulties, for the general PytharatuYY had been killed, and the men, without a commander, were fighting in a disorganized and confused manner, though not without heart. <prn id='Q1463572'>Polydorus</prn> did not pursue the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> when they gave way, nor <prn id='Q5850304'>Euphaes</prn>' men the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. It seemed better to him and his men to support the defeated wing; they did not, however, engage with <prn id='Q1463572'>Polydorus</prn>' force, for darkness had already descended on the field; </p>
<p id='4.8.11'><b>4.8.11</b> moreover, the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> were prevented from following the retiring force further not least by their ignorance of the country. Also it was an ancient practice with them not to carry out a pursuit too quickly, as they were more careful about maintaining their formation than about slaying the flying. In the center, where <prn id='Q11921265'>Euryleon</prn> was commanding the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, and <prn id='Q88465907'>Cleonnis</prn> on the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> side, the contest was undecided; the coming of night separated them here also. </p>
<p id='4.8.12'><b>4.8.12</b> This battle was fought principally or entirely by the heavy-armed troops on both sides. The mounted men were few and achieved nothing worth mention; for the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesians</pl> were not good horsemen then. The <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> light-armed and the <pl id='Q4752820'>Cretans</pl> on the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> side did not engage at all; for on both sides according to the ancient practice they were posted in reserve to their own infantry. </p>
<p id='4.8.13'><b>4.8.13</b> The following day neither side was minded to begin battle or to be the first to set up a trophy, but as the day advanced they made proposals for taking up the dead; when this was agreed on both sides, they proceeded to bury them. </p>
<p id='4.9.1'><b>4.9.1</b> But after the battle the affairs of the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> began to get serious. They were exhausted by the expenditure of money devoted to the garrisoning of the towns, and their slaves were deserting to the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. They were visited also by disease, which caused alarm, as resembling plague, although it did not attack all. In these circumstances they resolved to desert all their numerous towns inland and to settle on Mount <pl id='Q602538'>Ithome</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.9.2'><b>4.9.2</b> A small town existed here, which they say <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> mentions in the <prn id='Q1233048'>Catalogue</prn>: “Stepped <pl id='Q602538'>Ithome</pl>.” To this town they withdrew, extending the old circuit to form a sufficient protection for them all. The place was strong in other respects, for <pl id='Q602538'>Ithome</pl> falls short of none of the mountains within the <pl id='Q215200'>Isthmus</pl> in height and at this point was most difficult to climb. </p>
<p id='4.9.3'><b>4.9.3</b> They also resolved to send an envoy to <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>, and despatched <prn id='Q106632523'>Tisis</prn> the son of Alcis, a man of the highest reputation, considered to be fully versed in divination. While he was returning from <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> men from the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> garrison at <pl id='Q19760768'>Ampheia</pl> laid an ambush for him. Though trapped, he did not submit to be made a prisoner, but stood his ground to resist in spite of the wounds he received, until a voice was heard from an unseen quarter, “Let the bearer of the oracle go free.” </p>
<p id='4.9.4'><b>4.9.4</b> <prn id='Q106632523'>Tisis</prn>, reaching <pl id='Q602538'>Ithome</pl> with all speed, delivered the oracle to the king, and soon afterwards died of his wounds. <prn id='Q5850304'>Euphaes</prn> assembled the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> and made known the oracle: “Ye shall sacrifice a pure maiden to the gods below, appointed by lot of the blood of the sons of <prn id='Q406443'>Aepytus</prn>, and slay her by night. But if that ye cannot do, offer a maiden from another house, if the father gives her freely for the slaughter.” </p>
<p id='4.9.5'><b>4.9.5</b> When the god declared this, all the maidens of the house of the <prn id='Q106624449'>Aepytidae</prn> forthwith cast lots, and the lot fell on the daughter of <prn id='Q27892928'>Lyciscus</prn>. But <prn id='Q40970119'>Epebolus</prn> the seer forbade them to offer her, for she was not the daughter of <prn id='Q27892928'>Lyciscus</prn>, but the woman who was married to <prn id='Q27892928'>Lyciscus</prn> being unable to bear a child had palmed off the girl as hers. While <prn id='Q40970119'>Epebolus</prn> was making this declaration, <prn id='Q27892928'>Lyciscus</prn> took the girl away and deserted to <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.9.6'><b>4.9.6</b> The <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> were in despair when they saw that <prn id='Q27892928'>Lyciscus</prn> had fled; thereupon <prn id='Q2709649'>Aristodemus</prn>, a son of the house of the <prn id='Q106624449'>Aepytidae</prn>, of higher standing than <prn id='Q27892928'>Lyciscus</prn> both in reputation and in war, freely offered his daughter for the sacrifice. But human affairs and human purpose above all are obscured by fate, just as the mud of a river hides a pebble; for when <prn id='Q2709649'>Aristodemus</prn> was striving his utmost to save <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl>, fate set this obstacle in his path. </p>
<p id='4.9.7'><b>4.9.7</b> A <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl>, whose name is not recorded, was in love with the daughter of <prn id='Q2709649'>Aristodemus</prn>, and was already about to make her his wife. He at first disputed the rights of <prn id='Q2709649'>Aristodemus</prn> over the girl for <prn id='Q2709649'>Aristodemus</prn>, since he had betrothed her to himself had no further rights over the girl, but he to whom she was betrothed had greater rights than the father. Next, when he saw that this was of no avail, he had recourse to a shameless plea, that the girl was with child by him. </p>
<p id='4.9.8'><b>4.9.8</b> At last he drove <prn id='Q2709649'>Aristodemus</prn> to such a fury of passion that he killed his daughter; then cutting her open he showed that she was not pregnant. <prn id='Q40970119'>Epebolus</prn>, who was present, ordered another man to come forward and offer his daughter, for the daughter of <prn id='Q2709649'>Aristodemus</prn> was of no avail to them dead; for the father had murdered her, not offered her to the gods whom the <prn id='Q220344'>Pythia</prn> ordained. </p>
<p id='4.9.9'><b>4.9.9</b> When the seer said this, the multitude of the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> rushed on the girl's lover to kill him, since he had fixed the guilt of bloodshed on <prn id='Q2709649'>Aristodemus</prn> to no purpose, and had made their hopes of safety doubtful. But as he was a close friend of <prn id='Q5850304'>Euphaes</prn>, <prn id='Q5850304'>Euphaes</prn> persuaded the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> that the oracle was fulfilled by the death of the girl and that the deed done by <prn id='Q2709649'>Aristodemus</prn> sufficed for them. </p>
<p id='4.9.10'><b>4.9.10</b> When he said this, all the members of the house of the <prn id='Q106624449'>Aepytidae</prn> said that he spoke truth, for each was eager to be rid of the terror threatening his daughter. The people took the advice of' the king and broke up the assembly and thereupon turned to sacrifices to the gods and feasting. </p>
<p id='4.10.1'><b>4.10.1</b> But the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, when they heard the oracle given to the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>, were in despair, both they and their kings, and for the future shrank from offering battle. But five years after the escape of <prn id='Q27892928'>Lyciscus</prn> from <pl id='Q602538'>Ithome</pl>, the victims being auspicious, the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> marched against <pl id='Q602538'>Ithome</pl>. The <pl id='Q4752820'>Cretans</pl> were no longer with them. The allies of the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> also were late, for the <pl id='Q5690'>Spartans</pl> had now incurred the suspicion of others of the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesians</pl>, especially of the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> and <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>. The <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> intended to come without the knowledge of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, and by private enterprise rather than by public declaration. The expedition was openly proclaimed among the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl>, but they did not arrive either. For the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> were induced by the credit placed in the oracle to face the risk without allies. </p>
<p id='4.10.2'><b>4.10.2</b> This engagement did not differ in most points from the first, as on this occasion too daylight failed the combatants, but they record that on neither side was a wing or division broken, as they did not maintain the formation in which they were originally posted, champions on either side meeting in the middle, and there supporting the whole combat. </p>
<p id='4.10.3'><b>4.10.3</b> <prn id='Q5850304'>Euphaes</prn>, who showed more eagerness than a king should and recklessly attacked <prn id='Q460405'>Theopompus</prn>' bodyguard, received a number of mortal wounds. When he swooned and fell, the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> did their utmost to drag him into their own ranks, as he still breathed. But the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> were roused by the affection which they felt for their king and by the reproach which would be theirs. It seemed better to die for their kings and sacrifice their lives than that he should be abandoned while one of them escaped. </p>
<p id='4.10.4'><b>4.10.4</b> So the fall of <prn id='Q5850304'>Euphaes</prn> prolonged the battle and called forth further deeds of daring on both sides. He came to himself later and saw that his men had not had the worst of the fight, but he died in a few days, having reigned thirteen years over the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>, and having been at war with the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> for the whole of his reign. </p>
<p id='4.10.5'><b>4.10.5</b> <prn id='Q5850304'>Euphaes</prn>, having no children, left his kingdom to the man chosen by the people. <prn id='Q88465907'>Cleonnis</prn> and <prn id='Q1158563'>Damis</prn> came forward to dispute it with <prn id='Q2709649'>Aristodemus</prn>, as they were considered superior to him in war and all else. <prn id='Q121365916'>Antander</prn> had been killed by the enemy, risking his life for <prn id='Q5850304'>Euphaes</prn> in the battle. The views of both the seers, <prn id='Q40970119'>Epebolus</prn> and <prn id='Q42317289'>Ophioneus</prn>, were identical, that they should not give the honors of <prn id='Q406443'>Aepytus</prn> and his descendants to a man who was accursed and polluted by the murder of his daughter. </p>
<p id='4.10.6'><b>4.10.6</b> Nevertheless <prn id='Q2709649'>Aristodemus</prn> was chosen and became king. This <prn id='Q42317289'>Ophioneus</prn>, the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> seer, was blind from birth and practised the following method of divination. By learning the facts relevant to each case, both private and public, he thus foretold the future. This then was the way he practised his art. <prn id='Q2709649'>Aristodemus</prn>, becoming king, constantly was ready to show all reasonable favour to the people, and held all the nobles in honor, especially <prn id='Q88465907'>Cleonnis</prn> and <prn id='Q1158563'>Damis</prn>. He maintained good relations with the allies, sending gifts to the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadian</pl> leaders and to <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> and <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.10.7'><b>4.10.7</b> They carried on the war during his reign by means of constant forays with small parties, and made incursions into one another's country at harvest time, the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> being supported by the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> in their raids into <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconia</pl>. The <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> did not think fit to declare their hatred for the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> beforehand, but prepared to take part in the contest when it came. </p>
<p id='4.11.1'><b>4.11.1</b> In the fifth year of the reign of <prn id='Q2709649'>Aristodemus</prn>, being exhausted by the length of the war and by their expenditure, after due notice that a battle would be fought, both sides were joined by their allies, the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> by the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthians</pl> alone of the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesians</pl>, the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> by the full muster of' the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> and by picked troops from <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> and <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl>. The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> entrusted their center to the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthians</pl>, <prn id='Q462484'>Helots</prn> and all the neighboring peoples who were serving with them; they themselves and the kings were posted on the wings in a deeper and closer formation than ever before. </p>
<p id='4.11.2'><b>4.11.2</b> The dispositions of <prn id='Q2709649'>Aristodemus</prn> and his men were as follows: he selected the most serviceable of the arms for all the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> and <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> who were physically strong and stout hearted but did not possess powerful weapons, and as the matter was urgent, posted them with the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> and <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl>, extending the line that they might not be surrounded by the enemy. He also took care that they should be drawn up with Mount <pl id='Q602538'>Ithome</pl> in their rear. Placing <prn id='Q88465907'>Cleonnis</prn> in command of these troops, </p>
<p id='4.11.3'><b>4.11.3</b> he himself and <prn id='Q1158563'>Damis</prn> remained in reserve with the light troops consisting of a few slingers or archers, the bulk of the force being physically suited to rapid assaults and retirements and lightly armed. Not all of them possessed a breastplate or shield, but those who lacked them were protected with the skins of <prn id='Q2934'>goats</prn> and <prn id='Q7368'>sheep</prn>, some of them, particularly the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadian</pl> mountaineers, having the hides of wild beasts, <prn id='Q18498'>wolves</prn> and bears. </p>
<p id='4.11.4'><b>4.11.4</b> Each carried several javelins, and some of them spears. While these were in ambush in a part of <pl id='Q602538'>Ithome</pl> where they were least likely to be visible, the heavy-armed troops of the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> and their allies withstood the first assault of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, and continued after this to show courage in every way. They were inferior in numbers to the enemy, but were picked men fighting against levies, not selected troops like themselves, and so, by their bravery and training were more able to maintain a lengthy resistance. </p>
<p id='4.11.5'><b>4.11.5</b> Then the mobile <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> force, when the signal was given to them, charged the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> and enveloping them threw javelins on their flanks. All who were of higher courage ran in and struck at close quarters. The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, faced simultaneously with a second and unforeseen danger, were not demoralized, but turning on the light troops, tried to defend themselves. But, as the enemy with their light equipment drew off without difficulty, the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> were filled with perplexity and, as a consequence, with anger. </p>
<p id='4.11.6'><b>4.11.6</b> Men are apt to be most annoyed by what they regard as beneath them. So then the <pl id='Q5690'>Spartans</pl> who had already been wounded and all who after the fall of their comrades were the first to meet the attack of the light troops, ran out to meet them when they saw the light troops advancing and hotly extended the pursuit as they retired. The <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> light troops maintained their original tactics, striking and shooting at them when they stood still, and outstripping them in flight when they pursued, attacking again as they tried to retire. </p>
<p id='4.11.7'><b>4.11.7</b> They did this in separate parties and at different points of the enemy's line. The <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> heavy-armed and their allies meantime pressed more boldly on the troops facing them. Finally the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, worn out by the length of the battle and their wounds, and demoralized contrary to their custom by the light troops, broke their ranks. When they had been routed, the light troops inflicted greater damage on them. </p>
<p id='4.11.8'><b>4.11.8</b> It was impossible to reckon the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> losses in the battle, but I for my part am convinced that they were heavy. The rest made their retreat homewards without molestation, but for the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthians</pl> it was likely to be difficult, for whether they tried to retire through the <pl id='Q12649101'>Argolid</pl> or by <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl>, in either case it was through enemy country. </p>
<p id='4.12.1'><b>4.12.1</b> The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> were distressed by the reverse that had befallen them. Their losses in the battle were great and included important men, and they were inclined to despair of all hope in the war. For this reason they sent envoys to <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>, who received the following reply from the <prn id='Q220344'>Pythia</prn>: “<prn id='Q37340'>Phoebus</prn> bids thee pursue not only the task of war with the hand, but by guile a people holds the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> land, and by the same arts as they first employed shall the people fall. </p>
<p id='4.12.2'><b>4.12.2</b> At this the kings and ephors were eager to invent stratagems, but failed. They imitated that deed of <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn> at <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl>, and sent a hundred men to <pl id='Q602538'>Ithome</pl> to observe what the enemy were planning, but pretending to be deserters. A sentence of banishment had been openly pronounced on them. On their arrival <prn id='Q2709649'>Aristodemus</prn> at once sent them away, saying that the crimes of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> were new, but their tricks old. </p>
<p id='4.12.3'><b>4.12.3</b> Failing in their attempt, the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> next attempted to break up the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> alliance. But when repulsed by the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl>, to whom their ambassadors came first, they put off going to <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>. <prn id='Q2709649'>Aristodemus</prn>, hearing of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> intrigues, also sent men to enquire of the god. And the <prn id='Q220344'>Pythia</prn> replied to them: </p>
<p id='4.12.4'><b>4.12.4</b> "The god gives thee glory in war, but beware lest by guile the hated company of <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> scale the well-built walls, for mightier is their <prn id='Q40901'>Ares</prn>. And harsh shall be the dwellers in the circle of the dancing ground, when the two have started forth by one chance from the hidden ambush. Yet the holy day shall not behold this ending until their doom o'ertake those which have changed their nature." <br>At the time <prn id='Q2709649'>Aristodemus</prn> and the seers were at a loss to interpret the saying, but in a few years the god was like to reveal it and bring it to fulfillment. </p>
<p id='4.12.5'><b>4.12.5</b> Other things befell the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> at that time: while <prn id='Q27892928'>Lyciscus</prn> was living abroad in <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>, death overtook the daughter whom he carried with him on his flight from <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl>. As he often visited her tomb, <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadian</pl> horsemen lay in wait and captured him. When carried to <pl id='Q602538'>Ithome</pl> and brought into the assembly he urged that he had not departed a traitor to his country, but because he believed the words of the seer that the girl was not his own. </p>
<p id='4.12.6'><b>4.12.6</b> His defence did not win credence until the woman who was then holding the priesthood of <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> came into the theater. She confessed that she was the mother of the girl and had given her to <prn id='Q27892928'>Lyciscus</prn>' wife to pass off as her own. “And now,” she said, “revealing the secret, I have come to lay down my office.” She said this because it was an established custom in <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl> that, if a child of a man or woman holding a priesthood died before its parent, the office should pass to another. Accepting the truth of her statement, they chose another woman to take her place as priestess of the goddess, and said that <prn id='Q27892928'>Lyciscus</prn>' deed was pardonable. </p>
<p id='4.12.7'><b>4.12.7</b> After this, as the twentieth year of the war was approaching, they resolved to send again to <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> to ask concerning victory. The <prn id='Q220344'>Pythia</prn> made answer to their question: “To those who first around the altar set up tripods ten times ten to <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> of <pl id='Q602538'>Ithome</pl>, heaven grants glory in war and the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> land. For thus hath <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> ordained. <prn id='Q617977'>Deceit</prn> raised thee up and punishment follows after, nor would'st thou deceive the god. Act as fate wills, destruction comes on this man before that. </p>
<p id='4.12.8'><b>4.12.8</b> Hearing this they thought that the oracle was in their favour and granted them victory; for as they themselves possessed the sanctuary of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> of <pl id='Q602538'>Ithome</pl> within the walls, the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> could not forestall them in making the dedication. They set about making tripods of wood, as they had not money enough to make them of bronze. But one of the <pl id='Q75459'>Delphians</pl> reported the oracle to <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>. When they heard it, no plan occurred to them in public, </p>
<p id='4.12.9'><b>4.12.9</b> but <prn id='Q1162217'>Oebalus</prn>, a man of no repute in general, but evidently shrewd, made a hundred tripods, as best he might, of clay, and hiding them in a bag, carried nets with them like a hunter. As he was unknown even to most of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, he would more easily escape detection by the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>. Joining some countrymen, he entered <pl id='Q602538'>Ithome</pl> with them, and as soon as night fell, dedicated these tripods of clay to the god, and returned to <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> to tell the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.12.10'><b>4.12.10</b> The <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>, when they saw them, were greatly disturbed, thinking, rightly enough, that they were from the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. Nevertheless <prn id='Q2709649'>Aristodemus</prn> encouraged them, saying what the occasion demanded, and setting up the wooden tripods, which had already been made, round the altar of the god of <pl id='Q602538'>Ithome</pl>. It happened also that <prn id='Q42317289'>Ophioneus</prn>, the seer who had been blind from birth, received his sight in the most remarkable way. He was seized with a violent pain in the head, and thereupon received his sight. </p>
<p id='4.13.1'><b>4.13.1</b> Next, as fate was already inclining towards the conquest of the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>, the god revealed to them the future. For the armed statue of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, which was all of bronze, let its shield fall. And as <prn id='Q2709649'>Aristodemus</prn> was about to sacrifice the victims to <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> of <pl id='Q602538'>Ithome</pl>, the rams of their own accord leapt towards the altar, and dashing their horns violently against it were killed by the force of the blow. A third portent befell them. The <prn id='Q144'>dogs</prn> assembled together and howled every night, and at last fled together to the camp of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.13.2'><b>4.13.2</b> <prn id='Q2709649'>Aristodemus</prn> was alarmed by this and by the following dream which came to him. He thought that he was about to go forth armed to battle and the victims' entrails were lying before him on a table, when his daughter appeared, wearing a black robe and showing her breast and belly cut open; when she appeared she flung down what was on the table, stripped him of his arms, and instead set a golden crown on his head and put a white robe about him. </p>
<p id='4.13.3'><b>4.13.3</b> <prn id='Q2709649'>Aristodemus</prn>, who was already in despair, thought the dream foretold the end of life for him, because the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> used to carry out their chiefs for burial wearing a crown and dressed in white garments. Then he received news that <prn id='Q42317289'>Ophioneus</prn> the seer could no longer see but had suddenly become blind, as he was at first. Then they understood the oracle, that by the two starting forth from the ambush and again meeting their doom the <prn id='Q220344'>Pythia</prn> meant the eyes of <prn id='Q42317289'>Ophioneus</prn>. </p>
<p id='4.13.4'><b>4.13.4</b> Then <prn id='Q2709649'>Aristodemus</prn>, reckoning up his private sorrows, that to no purpose he had become the slayer of his daughter, and seeing that no hope of safety remained for his country, slew himself upon the tomb of his child. He had done all that human calculation could do to save the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>, but fortune brought to naught both his achievements and his plans. He had reigned six years and a few months when he died. </p>
<p id='4.13.5'><b>4.13.5</b> The <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> were plunged into despair, and were even ready to send to the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> to ask mercy, so demoralized were they by the death of <prn id='Q2709649'>Aristodemus</prn>. Their pride, however, prevented them from doing this. But they met in the assembly and chose not a king, but <prn id='Q1158563'>Damis</prn> as general with absolute power. He selected <prn id='Q88465907'>Cleonnis</prn> and <prn id='Q1779164'>Phyleus</prn> as colleagues, and even with their present resources made ready to join battle. For he was forced to this by the blockade, and above all by famine and by the consequent terror that they would be destroyed by want. </p>
<p id='4.13.6'><b>4.13.6</b> Even then the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> were not inferior in courage and brave deeds, but all their generals were killed and their most notable men. After this they held out for some five months, but as the year was coming to an end deserted <pl id='Q602538'>Ithome</pl>, the war having lasted twenty years in all, as is stated in the poems of <prn id='Q316094'>Tyrtaeus</prn>: “But in the twentieth year they left their rich tilled lands, and fled from out the lofty mountains of <pl id='Q602538'>Ithome</pl>. <prn id='Q316094'>Tyrtaeus</prn>, unknown location. </p>
<p id='4.13.7'><b>4.13.7</b> This war came to an end in the first year of the <prn id='Q11851954'>fourteenth Olympiad</prn> [724 BCE], when <prn id='Q5264650'>Dasmon</prn> of <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl> won the short footrace. At <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> the <prn id='Q106632597'>Medontidae</prn> were still holding the archonship as a ten years' office, <prn id='Q7515976'>Hippomenes</prn> having completed his fourth year. </p>
<p id='4.14.1'><b>4.14.1</b> All the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> who had ties with <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl> and <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> and among any of the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> retired to these states, but those who belonged to the family of the Priests and performed the mysteries of the <prn id='Q30025797'>Great Goddesses</prn>, to <pl id='Q94299853'>Eleusis</pl>. The majority of the common people were scattered in their native towns, as before. </p>
<p id='4.14.2'><b>4.14.2</b> The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> first razed <pl id='Q602538'>Ithome</pl> to the ground, then attacked and captured the remaining towns. Of the spoils they dedicated bronze tripods to the god of <pl id='Q13074886'>Amyclae</pl>. A statue of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> stands under the first tripod, of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> under the second, of <prn id='Q45967'>Kore</prn> or <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> under the third. </p>
<p id='4.14.3'><b>4.14.3</b> Dedicating these offerings at <pl id='Q13074886'>Amyclae</pl>, they gave to the people of <pl id='Q1154474'>Asine</pl>, who had been driven out by the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>, that part of <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl> on the coast which they still occupy; to the descendants of <prn id='Q5675384'>Androcles</prn> (he had a daughter, who with her children had fled at his death and come to <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>) they assigned the part called <prn id='Q87986778'>Hyamia</prn>. </p>
<p id='4.14.4'><b>4.14.4</b> The <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> themselves were treated in this way: First they exacted an oath that they would never rebel or attempt any kind of revolution. Secondly, though no fixed tribute was imposed on them, they used to bring the half of all the produce of their fields to <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>. It was also ordained that for the funerals of the kings and other magistrates men should come from <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl> with their wives in black garments, and a penalty was laid on those who disobeyed. </p>
<p id='4.14.5'><b>4.14.5</b> As to the wanton punishments which they inflicted on the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>, this is what is said in <prn id='Q316094'>Tyrtaeus</prn>' poems: “Like <prn id='Q19707'>asses</prn> worn by their great burdens, bringing of dire necessity to their masters the half of all the fruits the corn-land bears. That they were compelled to share their mourning, he shows by the following: “Wailing for their masters, they and their wives alike, whensoever the baneful doom of death came upon any. <prn id='Q316094'>Tyrtaeus</prn>, unknown location. </p>
<p id='4.14.6'><b>4.14.6</b> In these straits the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>, foreseeing no kindness from the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, and thinking death in battle or a complete migration from <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnese</pl> preferable to their present lot, resolved at all costs to revolt. They were incited to this mainly by the younger men, who were still without experience of war but were of high spirit and preferred death in a free country, even though slavery might bring happiness in all else. </p>
<p id='4.14.7'><b>4.14.7</b> Of the young men who had grown up in <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl> the best and most numerous were round <pl id='Q2537068'>Andania</pl>, and among them was <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn>, who to this day is worshipped as a hero among the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>. They think that even the circumstances of his birth were notable, for they assert that a spirit or a god united with his mother, <prn id='Q106632658'>Nicoteleia</prn>, in the form of a <prn id='Q2102'>serpent</prn>. I know that the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> tell a similar story about <prn id='Q223134'>Olympias</prn>, and the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl> about <prn id='Q18353959'>Aristodama</prn>, but there is this difference: </p>
<p id='4.14.8'><b>4.14.8</b> The <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> do not make <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> the son of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> or of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, as the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> do with <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn> and <prn id='Q3575327'>Ammon</prn>, and the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl> with <prn id='Q317331'>Aratus</prn> and <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>. Most of the Greeks say that <prn id='Q322639'>Pyrrhus</prn> was the father of <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn>, but I myself know that in their libations the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> call him <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> son of NicomedesYY. He then, being in the full vigor of youth and courage, with others of the nobles incited them to revolt. This was not done openly at first, but they sent secretly to <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> and to the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl>, to ask if they were ready to help unhesitatingly and no less energetically than in the former war. </p>
<p id='4.15.1'><b>4.15.1</b> When all their preparations were made for the war, the readiness of their allies exceeding expectation (for now the hatred which the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> and <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> felt for the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> had blazed up openly), they revolted in the thirty-ninth year after the capture of <pl id='Q602538'>Ithome</pl>, and in the fourth year of the <prn id='Q57337688'>twenty-third Olympiad</prn> [685 BCE], when <prn id='Q34041'>Icarus</prn> of <pl id='Q3563508'>Hyperesia</pl> won the short footrace. At <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> the archonship was now of annual tenure, and <prn id='Q106632723'>Tlesias</prn> held office. </p>
<p id='4.15.2'><b>4.15.2</b> <prn id='Q316094'>Tyrtaeus</prn> has not recorded the names of the kings then reigning in <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl>, but <prn id='Q2319055'>Rhianos</prn> stated in his epic that <prn id='Q360151'>Leotychides</prn> was king at the time of this war. I cannot agree with him at all on this point. Though <prn id='Q316094'>Tyrtaeus</prn> makes no statement, he may be regarded as having done so by the following; there are lines of his which refer to the first war: “Around it they fought unceasingly for nineteen years, ever maintaining a stout heart, the warrior fathers of our fathers. </p>
<p id='4.15.3'><b>4.15.3</b> It is obvious then that the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> went to war now in the second generation after the first war, and the sequence of time shows that the kings of <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> at that time were <prn id='Q488602'>Anaxander</prn> the son of <prn id='Q509010'>Eurycrates</prn>, son of <prn id='Q1463572'>Polydorus</prn>, and of the other house <prn id='Q1266225'>Anaxidamus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q1266218'>Zeuxidamus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q31790239'>Archidamus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q460405'>Theopompus</prn>. I go as far as the third in descent from <prn id='Q460405'>Theopompus</prn>, because <prn id='Q31790239'>Archidamus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q460405'>Theopompus</prn> died before his father, and the kingdom of <prn id='Q460405'>Theopompus</prn> passed to his grandson, <prn id='Q1266218'>Zeuxidamus</prn>. But <prn id='Q360151'>Leotychides</prn> clearly succeeded <prn id='Q334478'>Demaratus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q1266372'>Ariston</prn>, <prn id='Q1266372'>Ariston</prn> being sixth in descent from <prn id='Q460405'>Theopompus</prn>. </p>
<p id='4.15.4'><b>4.15.4</b> In the first year after the revolt the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> engaged the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> at a place called DeraeYY in <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl>, both sides being without their allies. Neither side won a clear victory, but <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> is said to have achieved more than it seemed that one man could, so that, as he was of the race of the <prn id='Q106624449'>Aepytidae</prn>, they were for making him king after the battle. As he declined, they appointed him general with absolute power. </p>
<p id='4.15.5'><b>4.15.5</b> It was the view of <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> that any man would be ready to die in battle if he had first done deeds worthy of record, but that it was his own especial task at the very beginning of the war to prove that he had struck terror into the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> and that he would be more terrible to them for the future. With this purpose he came by night to <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl> and fixed on the temple of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> of the <pl id='Q57302774'>Brazen House</pl> a shield inscribed “The Gift of <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> to the Goddess, taken from <pl id='Q5690'>Spartans</pl>.” </p>
<p id='4.15.6'><b>4.15.6</b> The <pl id='Q5690'>Spartans</pl> received an oracle from <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> that they should procure the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> as counsellor. So they sent messengers to <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> to announce the oracle, asking for a man to advise what they must do. The <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, who were not anxious either that the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> should add to their possessions the best part of <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnese</pl> without great dangers, or that they themselves should disobey the god, made their plans accordingly. There was a man <prn id='Q316094'>Tyrtaeus</prn>, a teacher of letters, who was considered of poor intellect and was lame in one foot. Him they sent to <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>. On his arrival he recited his poems in elegiacs and anapaests to the nobles in private and to all whom he could collect. </p>
<p id='4.15.7'><b>4.15.7</b> A year after the fight at DeraeYY, both sides being joined by their allies, they prepared to join battle at the <prn id='Q58697'>Boar</prn>'s Tomb, as it is called. The <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> had the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleians</pl> and <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> and also succors from <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> and from <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl>. They were joined by all the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> who had previously been in voluntary exile, together with those from <pl id='Q11918833'>Eleusis</pl>, whose hereditary task it was to perform the rites of the <prn id='Q30025797'>Great Goddesses</prn>, and the descendants of <prn id='Q5675384'>Androcles</prn>. These indeed were their most zealous supporters. </p>
<p id='4.15.8'><b>4.15.8</b> The <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthians</pl> came to fight on the side of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, and some of the <pl id='Q5860679'>Lepreans</pl> owing to their hatred of the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleians</pl>. But the people of <pl id='Q1154474'>Asine</pl> were bound by oaths to both sides. This spot, the <prn id='Q58697'>Boar</prn>'s Tomb, lies in <pl id='Q15829811'>Stenyclerus</pl> of <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl>, and there, as is said, <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> exchanged oaths with the sons of <prn id='Q637955'>Neleus</prn> over the pieces of a <prn id='Q58697'>boar</prn>. </p>
<p id='4.16.1'><b>4.16.1</b> Sacrifice was offered by the seers on both sides before the battle; on the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> side by <prn id='Q106632780'>Hecas</prn>, descendant and namesake of the <prn id='Q106632780'>Hecas</prn> who had come with the sons of <prn id='Q666525'>Aristodemus</prn> to <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>, on the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> side by <prn id='Q31790263'>Theoclus</prn>, who was descended from <prn id='Q122965765'>Eumantis</prn>, an <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleian</pl> of the house of the <prn id='Q5980707'>Iamidae</prn>, whom <prn id='Q1788026'>Cresphontes</prn> had brought to <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl>. Then in the presence of the seers both sides were spurred by greater ardor for the fight. </p>
<p id='4.16.2'><b>4.16.2</b> All showed the zeal that befitted their age and strength, but <prn id='Q488602'>Anaxander</prn>, the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> king, and his <pl id='Q5690'>Spartan</pl> guard above all. On the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> side the descendants of <prn id='Q5675384'>Androcles</prn>, <prn id='Q3559805'>Phintas</prn> and <prn id='Q5675384'>Androcles</prn>, and their company tried to acquit themselves like brave men. <prn id='Q316094'>Tyrtaeus</prn> and the chief priests of the <prn id='Q30025797'>Great Goddesses</prn> took no part in the action, but urged on the hindmost on their own sides. </p>
<p id='4.16.3'><b>4.16.3</b> As to <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> himself he had with him eighty picked men of the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> of the same age as himself, each one of them thinking it the highest honor that he had been thought worthy of a place in the troop with <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn>. They were quick to understand each other's movements, especially those of their leader, when he began or contemplated any manoeuvre. They themselves with <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> were at first hard pressed in face of <prn id='Q488602'>Anaxander</prn> and the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> champions, but receiving wounds unflinchingly and slowing every form of desperate courage they repulsed <prn id='Q488602'>Anaxander</prn> and his men by their long endurance and valor. </p>
<p id='4.16.4'><b>4.16.4</b> As they fled, <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> ordered another <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> troop to undertake the pursuit. He himself attacked the enemies' line where it was firmest, and after breaking it at this point sought a new point of assault. Soon successful here, he was the more ready to assail those who stood their ground, until he threw into confusion the whole line of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> themselves and of their allies. They were now running without shame and without waiting for one another, while he assailed them with a terror that seemed more than one man's fury could inspire. </p>
<p id='4.16.5'><b>4.16.5</b> There was a wild pear-tree growing in the plain, beyond which <prn id='Q31790263'>Theoclus</prn> the seer forbade him to pass, for he said that the <prn id='Q190103'>Dioscuri</prn> were seated on the tree. <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn>, in the heat of passion, did not hear all that the seer said, and when he reached the tree, lost his shield, and his disobedience gave to the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> an opportunity for some to escape from the rout. For he lost time trying to recover his shield. </p>
<p id='4.16.6'><b>4.16.6</b> The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> were thrown into despair after this blow and purposed to put an end to the war. But <prn id='Q316094'>Tyrtaeus</prn> by reciting his poems contrived to dissuade them, and filled their ranks from the <prn id='Q462484'>Helots</prn> to replace the slain. When <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> returned to <pl id='Q2537068'>Andania</pl>, the women threw ribbons and flower blossoms over him, singing also a song which is sung to this day: “To the middle of <pl id='Q15829811'>Stenyclerus</pl>' plain and to the hilltop <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> followed after the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. Unknown. </p>
<p id='4.16.7'><b>4.16.7</b> He recovered his shield also, going to <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> and descending into the holy <pl id='Q12880663'>shrine</pl> of <prn id='Q1166183'>Trophonius</prn> at <pl id='Q11931280'>Lebadeia</pl>, as the <prn id='Q220344'>Pythia</prn> bade. Afterwards he took the shield of <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> to <pl id='Q11931280'>Lebadeia</pl> and dedicated it, and I myself have seen it there among the offerings. The device on it is an <prn id='Q2092297'>eagle</prn> with both wings outspread to the rim. Now on his return from <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl> having learnt of the shield at the <pl id='Q12880663'>shrine</pl> of <prn id='Q1166183'>Trophonius</prn> and recovered it, he at once engaged in greater deeds. </p>
<p id='4.16.8'><b>4.16.8</b> Collecting a force of <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>, together with his own picked troop, he waited for night and went to a city of <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconia</pl> whose ancient name in <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>'s <prn id='Q1233048'>Catalogue</prn> is <pl id='Q16566337'>Pharis</pl>, but is called PharaeYY by the <pl id='Q5690'>Spartans</pl> and neighboring people. Arriving here he killed those who offered resistance and surrounding the <prn id='Q830'>cattle</prn> started to drive them off to <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl>. On the way he was attacked by <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> troops under king <prn id='Q488602'>Anaxander</prn>, but put them to flight and began to pursue <prn id='Q488602'>Anaxander</prn>; but he stopped the pursuit when wounded in the buttocks with a javelin; he did not, however, lose the booty which he was driving away. </p>
<p id='4.16.9'><b>4.16.9</b> After waiting only for the wound to heal, he was making an attack by night on <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> itself, but was deterred by the appearance of <prn id='Q164061'>Helen</prn> and of the <prn id='Q190103'>Dioscuri</prn>. But he lay in wait by day for the maidens who were performing the dances in honor of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> at <pl id='Q59148716'>Caryae</pl>, and capturing those who were wealthiest and of noblest birth, carried them off to a village in <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl>, entrusting them to men of his troop to guard, while he rested for the night. </p>
<p id='4.16.10'><b>4.16.10</b> There the young men, intoxicated, I suppose, and without any self-control, attempted to violate the girls. When <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> attempted to deter them from an action contrary to Greek usage, they paid no attention, so that he was compelled to kill the most disorderly. He released the captives for a large ransom, maidens, as when he captured them. </p>
<p id='4.17.1'><b>4.17.1</b> There is a place <pl id='Q60790908'>Aegila</pl> in <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconia</pl>, where is a sanctuary sacred to <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>. <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> and his men knowing that the women were keeping festival there . . . the women were inspired by the goddess to defend themselves, and most of the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> were wounded with the knives with which the women sacrificed the victims and the spits on which they pierced and roasted the meat. <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> was struck with the torches and taken alive. Nevertheless he escaped to <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl> during the same night. Archidameia, the priestess of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>, was charged with having released him, not for a bribe but because she had been in love with him before; but she maintained that <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> had escaped by burning through his bonds. </p>
<p id='4.17.2'><b>4.17.2</b> In the third year of the war, when an engagement was about to take place at what is called the <prn id='Q3636289'>Great Trench</prn>, and the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> had been joined by <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> from all the cities, the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> bribed <prn id='Q666652'>Aristocrates</prn> the son of <prn id='Q12878149'>Hicetas</prn> of <pl id='Q7835586'>Trapezus</pl>, who was then king and general of the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl>. The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> were the first of whom we know to give bribes to an enemy, and the first to make victory in war a matter of purchase. </p>
<p id='4.17.3'><b>4.17.3</b> Before the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> committed this crime in the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> war in the matter of the treachery of <prn id='Q666652'>Aristocrates</prn> the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadian</pl>, the decision in battle was reached by valor and the fortune of heaven. Again it is clear that at a later date, when they were lying opposite the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> fleet at <pl id='Q404513'>Aegospotami</pl>, the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> bought <prn id='Q353570'>Adeimantus</prn> and other <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> generals. </p>
<p id='4.17.4'><b>4.17.4</b> However in course of time the punishment of <prn id='Q322639'>Neoptolemus</prn>, as it is called, came upon the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> themselves in their turn. Now it was the fate of <prn id='Q322639'>Neoptolemus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn>, after killing <prn id='Q170473'>Priam</prn> on the altar of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q103020456'>Herkeios</prn> (Of the Courtyard), himself to be slain by the altar of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> in <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>.

<p id='4.17.5'><b>4.17.5</b> So in the case of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, when they were at the height of their power after the destruction of the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> fleet, and <prn id='Q271850'>Agesilaus</prn> had already reduced the greater part of <prn id='Q48'>Asia</prn>, they were unable to capture the whole empire of the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl> but the barbarian overreached them with their own invention, sending money to <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl>, <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>, <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> and <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> as the result of this bribery the so-called <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthian</pl> war broke out, compelling <prn id='Q271850'>Agesilaus</prn> to abandon his conquests in <prn id='Q48'>Asia</prn>. </p>
<p id='4.17.6'><b>4.17.6</b> Thus it was the purpose of heaven to turn the trick employed by the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> against the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> to their own destruction. After receiving the money from <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl>, <prn id='Q666652'>Aristocrates</prn> concealed his plot from the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> for the present, but when they were about to come into action, he alarmed them by saying that they were caught in a difficult place and there would be no means of retreat for them, if defeated, also that the offerings had not been satisfactory. He ordered everyone therefore to take to flight when he gave the signal. </p>
<p id='4.17.7'><b>4.17.7</b> When the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> were about to close and the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> were occupied on their own front, then <prn id='Q666652'>Aristocrates</prn> withdrew the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> as the battle began, leaving the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> left and center without troops. For the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> occupied both positions in the absence of the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleians</pl> from the battle and of the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> and <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl>. To complete his work <prn id='Q666652'>Aristocrates</prn> caused his men to fly through the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.17.8'><b>4.17.8</b> They were amazed at the unexpected state of affairs, and moreover were thrown into confusion by the passage of the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> through their ranks, so that they almost forgot what lay before them; for instead of the advance of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> they watched the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadian</pl> retirement, some begging them to stand by them, others cursing them for traitors and scoundrels. </p>
<p id='4.17.9'><b>4.17.9</b> It was not difficult for the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> to surround the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> thus isolated, and they won without trouble the easiest of victories. <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> and his men held together and tried to check the fiercest of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> assaults but, being few in number, were unable to render much assistance. So great were the numbers of the people of the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> slain that in lieu of their former thoughts of becoming the masters instead of the slaves of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> they now despaired of safety itself. Among the chieftains killed were AndroclesYY and <prn id='Q3559805'>Phintas</prn>, and <prn id='Q21898098'>Phanas</prn> after the most glorious resistance. He had previously been victorious in the long foot race at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.17.10'><b>4.17.10</b> <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> collected the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> survivors after the battle and persuaded them to desert <pl id='Q2537068'>Andania</pl> and most of the other towns that lay in the interior and to settle on Mount <pl id='Q16575287'>Eira</pl>. When they had been driven to this spot, the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> sat down to besiege them, thinking that they would soon reduce them. Nevertheless the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> maintained their resistance for eleven years after the disaster at the <prn id='Q3636289'>Trench</prn>. </p>
<p id='4.17.11'><b>4.17.11</b> The length of the siege is proved by these lines of the poet <prn id='Q2319055'>Rhianus</prn>, regarding the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>: “In the folds of the white mountain were they encamped, for two and twenty winters and green herbs.” He reckons winters and summers, by “green herbs” meaning the green corn or the time just before harvest. </p>
<p id='4.18.1'><b>4.18.1</b> Settling on <pl id='Q16575287'>Eira</pl> and cut off from the rest of <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl>, except in so far as the people of <pl id='Q2047396'>Pylos</pl> and <pl id='Q60790706'>Mothone</pl> maintained the coastal districts for them, the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> plundered both <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconia</pl> and their own territory, regarding it now as enemy country. The men taking part in the raids were drawn from all sources, and <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> raised the number of his chosen troop to three hundred. </p>
<p id='4.18.2'><b>4.18.2</b> They harried and plundered whatever <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> property they could; when corn, <prn id='Q830'>cattle</prn> and wine were captured, they were consumed, but movable property and men were sold. The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, as their labours were more profitable to the men at <pl id='Q16575287'>Eira</pl> than to themselves, accordingly resolved that <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl> and the neighboring part of <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconia</pl> should be left uncultivated during the war. </p>
<p id='4.18.3'><b>4.18.3</b> As a result scarcity arose in <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>, and with it revolution. For those who had property here could not endure its lying idle. Their differences were being composed by <prn id='Q316094'>Tyrtaeus</prn>, when <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> and his troop, starting in the late evening and by rapid movement reaching <pl id='Q13074886'>Amyclae</pl> before sunrise, captured and plundered the town, retiring before a force from <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> could come to its relief. </p>
<p id='4.18.4'><b>4.18.4</b> He continued to overrun the country afterwards, until in an engagement with more than half the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> infantry and both the kings he received various wounds while defending himself and was struck on the head by a stone, so that his eyes became dizzy. When he fell a number of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> closed upon him and took him alive with some fifty of his followers. The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> resolved to fling them all into the <pl id='Q38283240'>Ceadas</pl>, into which they throw men punished for the greatest crimes. </p>
<p id='4.18.5'><b>4.18.5</b> The rest of the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> were killed at once as they fell, but <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> now as on other occasions was preserved by one of the gods. His panegyrists say that, when <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> was thrown into the <pl id='Q38283240'>Ceadas</pl>, an <prn id='Q2092297'>eagle</prn> flew below him and supported him with its wings, bringing him to the bottom without any damage to his body and without wound. Even from here, as it seems, it was the will of heaven to show him a means of escape. </p>
<p id='4.18.6'><b>4.18.6</b> For when he came to the bottom of the chasm he lay down, and covering himself with his cloak awaited the death that fate had surely decreed. But after two days he heard a noise and uncovered, and being by this time able to see through the gloom, saw a <prn id='Q8331'>fox</prn> devouring the dead bodies. Realizing that the beast must have some entrance, he waited for the <prn id='Q8331'>fox</prn> to come near him, and then seized it. Whenever it turned on him he used one hand to hold out his cloak for it to bite. For the most part he kept pace with it as it ran, but over the more difficult ground he was dragged along by it. At last he saw a hole big enough for a <prn id='Q8331'>fox</prn> to get through and daylight showing through it. </p>
<p id='4.18.7'><b>4.18.7</b> The <prn id='Q8331'>fox</prn>, when released by <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn>, made of presumably, to its earth. But <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> enlarged the hole, which was not large enough to let him through, with his hands and reached his home at <pl id='Q16575287'>Eira</pl> in safety, having undergone a remarkable chance in the matter of his capture, for his courage and prowess were so high that no one would have expected <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> to be made a prisoner. Still more remarkable, and a convincing example of divine assistance, was his escape from the <pl id='Q38283240'>Ceadas</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.19.1'><b>4.19.1</b> The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> at once received information from deserters that <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> had returned in safety. Though they thought it as incredible as the news that anyone had risen from the dead, their belief was ensured by the following action on the part of <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> himself. The <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthians</pl> were sending a force to assist the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> in the reduction of <pl id='Q16575287'>Eira</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.19.2'><b>4.19.2</b> Learning from his scouts that their march discipline was lax and that their encampments were made without precaution, <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> attacked them by night. He slew most of them while the rest were still sleeping, and killed the leaders <prn id='Q122965797'>Hypermenides</prn>, <prn id='Q122965814'>Achladaeus</prn>, Lysistratu1 and Sidectus. And having plundered the generals' tent, he made it clear to the <pl id='Q5690'>Spartans</pl> that it was <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> and no other <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> who had done this. </p>
<p id='4.19.3'><b>4.19.3</b> He also made the sacrifice called the Offering for the hundred slain to <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> of <pl id='Q602538'>Ithome</pl>. This was an old-established custom, all <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> making it who had slain their hundred enemies. <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> first offered it after the battle at the <prn id='Q58697'>Boar</prn>'s Tomb, his second offering was occasioned by the slaughter of the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthians</pl> in the night. It is said that he made a third offering as the result of his later raids. </p>
<p id='4.19.4'><b>4.19.4</b> Now the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, as the festival of <prn id='Q207273'>Hyacinthus</prn> was approaching, made a truce of forty days with the men of <pl id='Q16575287'>Eira</pl>. They themselves returned home to keep the feast, but some <pl id='Q4752820'>Cretan</pl> archers, whom they had summoned as mercenaries from <pl id='Q1001533'>Lyctus</pl> and other cities, were patrolling <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl> for them. <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> then, in view of the truce, was at a distance from <pl id='Q16575287'>Eira</pl> and was advancing somewhat carelessly, when seven of these archers laid an ambush for him. They captured him and bound him with the thongs which they had on their quivers, as evening was coming on. </p>
<p id='4.19.5'><b>4.19.5</b> So two of them went to <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>, bringing the glad news that <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> had been captured. The rest went to one of the farms in <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl>, where there dwelt a fatherless girl with her mother. On the previous night the girl had seen a dream. Wolves brought a <prn id='Q140'>lion</prn> to their farm bound and without talons; but she herself loosed the <prn id='Q140'>lion</prn> from his bonds and found and gave to him his talons, and thus it seemed that the <prn id='Q18498'>wolves</prn> were torn in pieces by the <prn id='Q140'>lion</prn>. </p>
<p id='4.19.6'><b>4.19.6</b> And now when the <pl id='Q4752820'>Cretans</pl> brought in <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn>, the girl realized that the dream of the night had come true, and asked her mother who he was. On learning she was encouraged, and looking intently at him understood what she had been bidden to do. Accordingly she plied the <pl id='Q4752820'>Cretans</pl> with wine, and when they were overcome with drunkenness she stole away the dagger of the man who was sleeping most heavily. Then the girl cut the bonds of <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn>, and he took the sword and despatched the men. This maiden was taken to wife by <prn id='Q20851109'>Gorgus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn>. <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> gave him to the girl as a recompense for saving his life, for <prn id='Q20851109'>Gorgus</prn> had not yet completed his eighteenth year when he wedded her. </p>
<p id='4.20.1'><b>4.20.1</b> But in the eleventh year of the siege it was fated that <pl id='Q16575287'>Eira</pl> should be taken and the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> dispersed, and the god fulfilled for them an oracle given to <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> and <prn id='Q31790263'>Theoclus</prn>. They had come to <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> after the disaster at the <prn id='Q3636289'>Trench</prn> and asked concerning safety, receiving this reply from the <prn id='Q220344'>Pythia</prn>: “Whensoever a he-<prn id='Q2934'>goat</prn> drinks of <pl id='Q1641987'>Neda</pl>'s winding stream, no more do I protect <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl>, for destruction is at hand. </p>
<p id='4.20.2'><b>4.20.2</b> The springs of the <pl id='Q1641987'>Neda</pl> are in <pl id='Q1878690'>Mount Lykaion</pl>. The river flows through the land of the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> and turning again towards <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl> forms the boundary on the coast between <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl> and <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>. Then they were afraid of the he-<prn id='Q2934'>goats</prn> drinking from the <pl id='Q1641987'>Neda</pl>, but it appeared that what the god foretold to them was this. Some of the Greeks call the wild fig-tree olynthe, but the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> themselves tragos (he-goat). Now at that time a wild fig-tree growing on the bank of the <pl id='Q1641987'>Neda</pl> had not grown straight up, but was bending towards the stream and touching the water with the tips of its leaves. </p>
<p id='4.20.3'><b>4.20.3</b> When the seer <prn id='Q31790263'>Theoclus</prn> saw it, he guessed that the <prn id='Q2934'>goat</prn> who drinks of the <pl id='Q1641987'>Neda</pl> foretold by the <prn id='Q220344'>Pythia</prn> was this wild fig-tree, and that their fate had already come upon the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>. He kept it secret from the rest, but led <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> to the fig-tree and showed him that their time of safety had gone by. <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> believed that it was so and that there was no delaying their fate, and made provision such as circumstances demanded. </p>
<p id='4.20.4'><b>4.20.4</b> For the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> possessed a secret thing. If it were destroyed, <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl> would be overwhelmed and lost for ever, but if it were kept, the oracles of <prn id='Q1200671'>Lycus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q1076578'>Pandion</prn> said that after lapse of time the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> would recover their country. <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn>, knowing the oracles, took it towards nightfall, and coming to the most deserted part of <pl id='Q602538'>Ithome</pl>, buried it on the mountain, calling on <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> who keeps <pl id='Q602538'>Ithome</pl> and the gods who had hitherto protected the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> to remain guardians of the pledge, and not to put their only hope of return into the power of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.20.5'><b>4.20.5</b> After this, as formerly for the <pl id='Q22647'>Trojans</pl>, the beginning of the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> misfortunes was in adultery. The <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> commanded the mountain of <pl id='Q16575287'>Eira</pl> and its slopes as far as the <pl id='Q1641987'>Neda</pl>, some of them having their dwellings outside the gates. The only deserter that came to them from <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconia</pl> was a herdsman, slave of <prn id='Q122965870'>Emperamus</prn>, bringing his master's <prn id='Q830'>cattle</prn>. <prn id='Q122965870'>Emperamus</prn> was a man of repute in <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.20.6'><b>4.20.6</b> This herdsman, who kept his <prn id='Q830'>cattle</prn> not far from the <pl id='Q1641987'>Neda</pl>, saw the wife of one of the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>, who had their dwellings outside the wall, as she came to draw water. Falling in love with her, he dared to speak with her and seduced her with gifts. Thenceforward he marked the time when her husband went away to mount guard, garrison duty on the acropolis being undertaken by the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> in turn. For it was at this point that they were most afraid of the enemy making their way into the town. Whenever he went away, then the herdsman used to visit the lady. </p>
<p id='4.20.7'><b>4.20.7</b> Now once when it happened that the turn for duty fell to him and others in the night, it chanced that there was heavy rain, and the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> deserted their post. For they were overcome by the density of the rain that streamed from heaven, as there were no battlements or towers erected on the wall owing to the hurried nature of its building; moreover they did not expect the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> even to stir on a moonless night that was so stormy. </p>
<p id='4.20.8'><b>4.20.8</b> A few days earlier a merchant from <pl id='Q178488'>Cephallenia</pl>, who was a friend of <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> and was bringing to <pl id='Q16575287'>Eira</pl> all that they needed, had been captured by the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> and archers from <pl id='Q622234'>Aptera</pl>, commanded by A723;A724 the <pl id='Q5690'>Spartan</pl>; <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> rescued him and recovered all the goods that he was bringing, but had himself been wounded and was unable to visit rounds, as was his custom. This was the main reason that the acropolis was deserted. </p>
<p id='4.20.9'><b>4.20.9</b> All of them left their posts and with them the husband of the woman seduced by the herdsman. She was entertaining the herdsman at the time but heard her husband coming and at once hid the man away as quickly as possible. When the husband entered, she treated him with greater affection than ever before and asked him what was the reason of his return. But knowing that she was unfaithful or that the herdsman was in the house, he told her the truth, that owing to the violence of the rain he and all the rest had deserted their post. </p>
<p id='4.20.10'><b>4.20.10</b> The herdsman listened to him speaking, and learning the exact position, again deserted from the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> to the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. The Kings were absent at the time from the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> camp, but <prn id='Q122965870'>Emperamus</prn>, his master, who was commandant, was conducting the siege of <pl id='Q16575287'>Eira</pl>. Coming to him he first begged forgiveness for his crime of deserting and then showed him that now was the time for them to take <pl id='Q16575287'>Eira</pl>, recounting everything that he had learnt from the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.21.1'><b>4.21.1</b> His story seemed to be reliable, and he led the way for <prn id='Q122965870'>Emperamus</prn> and the <pl id='Q5690'>Spartans</pl>. Their march was difficult, as it was dark and the rain never ceased. Nevertheless they accomplished it in their eagerness, and arriving before the acropolis of <pl id='Q16575287'>Eira</pl>, mounted by raising ladders and in any other way that was possible. Various indications of the trouble that was upon them were given to the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>, especially by the <prn id='Q144'>dogs</prn> barking, not in their usual fashion, but uttering more loud and continuous howls. Realizing that the supreme and most desperate crisis had come upon them, they did not wait to collect all their arms but snatched whatever lay ready to the hand of each, to defend the fatherland that alone was left to them of all <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.21.2'><b>4.21.2</b> The first to realize that the enemy were within and to go against them were <prn id='Q20851109'>Gorgus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn>, <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> himself, <prn id='Q31790263'>Theoclus</prn> the seer and <prn id='Q31789658'>Manticlus</prn> his son, and with them EuergetidYY a man of high repute in <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl> who had attained to greater honor through his wife for he was wedded to <prn id='Q106782065'>Hagnagora</prn>, the sister of <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn>. Then the rest, though understanding that they were caught as in a net, nevertheless derived some hope even from their present plight. </p>
<p id='4.21.3'><b>4.21.3</b> But <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> and the seer knew that there was no putting off destruction for the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>, for they knew the riddle of the oracle which the <prn id='Q220344'>Pythia</prn> had uttered concerning the <prn id='Q2934'>goat</prn>. Nevertheless they would not declare it, and kept it secret from the rest. As they hastened through the city, visiting all, they exhorted those whom they encountered, when they saw that they were <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>, to be brave men, and summoned from the houses those who still remained. </p>
<p id='4.21.4'><b>4.21.4</b> During the night nothing worthy of mention was done on either side; for their ignorance of the ground and the daring of <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> gave pause to the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, while the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> had not previously received a watchword from their generals, and the rain would put out torches or any other light that they kindled. </p>
<p id='4.21.5'><b>4.21.5</b> When it was day and they could see one another <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> and <prn id='Q31790263'>Theoclus</prn> tried to rouse the fury of despair in the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>, setting forth all that suited the occasion and reminding them of the valor of the men of <pl id='Q1379299'>Smyrna</pl>, how, though an <pl id='Q620874'>Ionian</pl> people, by their valor and courage they had driven out <prn id='Q312537'>Gyges</prn> the son of <prn id='Q1171928'>Dascylus</prn> and the <pl id='Q620765'>Lydians</pl>, when they were in occupation of their town. </p>
<p id='4.21.6'><b>4.21.6</b> The <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>, when they heard, were filled with desperate courage, and mustering as they happened to be gathered rushed on the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. Women too were eager to fling tiles and what they could upon the enemy, yet the violence of the rain prevented them from doing this and from mounting to the house-tops. But they dared to take arms, and they too further inflamed the ardor of the men, when they saw their women preferring to perish with their fatherland rather than be taken as slaves to <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl>, so that they might yet have been able to escape their fate. </p>
<p id='4.21.7'><b>4.21.7</b> But the god caused the rain to descend more densely, with loud claps of thunder, and dazzled their eyes with lightning flashing in their faces. All this put courage in the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, who said that heaven itself was-helping them and as the lightning was on their right, <prn id='Q106632818'>Hecas</prn> the seer declared the sign of good omen. </p>
<p id='4.21.8'><b>4.21.8</b> It was he who devised the following plan. The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> far outnumbered the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>, but as the battle was not being fought on open ground with troops in line, but they were fighting over different quarters of the town, the rearmost of each detachment were rendered useless. <prn id='Q106632818'>Hecas</prn> ordered these to retire to the camp, take food and sleep, and return before evening to relieve their own men who were to remain on duty. </p>
<p id='4.21.9'><b>4.21.9</b> The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, by resting and fighting by turns, held out the longer, but the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> were faced with difficulties on all sides. They fought continuously day and night until the third day with none to relieve them. When the next day dawned, worn out by lack of sleep and by the rain and cold from heaven, they were assailed by hunger and thirst. The women especially, unaccustomed to war, were exhausted by the continuous suffering. </p>
<p id='4.21.10'><b>4.21.10</b> So the seer <prn id='Q31790263'>Theoclus</prn> came to <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn>' side and said: “Why vainly maintain this toil? The decree of fate stands fast that <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl> should fall; long since the <prn id='Q220344'>Pythia</prn> declared to us the disaster now before our eyes, and lately the fig-tree revealed it. On me the gods have laid one doom with my country, but do thou save the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> with what power thou hast and save thyself.” When he had spoken to <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> he rushed upon the enemy, and these were the words that he was constrained to fling at the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. “Yet not for all time shall you enjoy the fruits of <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl> with impunity.” </p>
<p id='4.21.11'><b>4.21.11</b> Then falling upon the men who faced him he killed them and himself was wounded, and having sated his passion with the slaughter of his foes, he breathed his last. But <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> called the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> back from the fight, except those who by virtue of their courage were fighting to cover them. These he allowed to remain at their post. The rest he ordered to receive the women and children within their ranks and follow him wherever he should show a passage. </p>
<p id='4.21.12'><b>4.21.12</b> He appointed <prn id='Q20851109'>Gorgus</prn> and <prn id='Q31789658'>Manticlus</prn> to command the rear, he himself ran to the head of the company and by the gestures of his head and movement of his spear signified that he asked a passage and had resolved to depart. EmperamusYY and the <pl id='Q5690'>Spartans</pl> present were pleased to let the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> pass, without further inflaming men who had reached the bounds of frenzy and despair. Moreover <prn id='Q106632818'>Hecas</prn> the seer ordered them to act thus. </p>
<p id='4.22.1'><b>4.22.1</b> As soon as the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> heard of the Capture of <pl id='Q16575287'>Eira</pl>, they at once ordered <prn id='Q666652'>Aristocrates</prn> to lead them to the rescue of the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> or to death with them. But he, being in receipt of bribes from <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl>, refused to lead them, and said that he knew that no <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> survived for them to help. </p>
<p id='4.22.2'><b>4.22.2</b> When they obtained more certain news, that they survived and had been forced to desert <pl id='Q16575287'>Eira</pl>, they themselves proposed to receive them at <pl id='Q1878690'>Mount Lykaion</pl> after preparing clothing and food, and sent some of their leading men to comfort the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> and also to be their guides on the way. After their safe arrival at <pl id='Q1878690'>Mount Lykaion</pl>, the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> entertained them and treated them kindly in every way, offering to distribute them among their towns and to make a new distribution of their land on their account. </p>
<p id='4.22.3'><b>4.22.3</b> But <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn>' grief for the sack of <pl id='Q16575287'>Eira</pl> and his hatred of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> suggested to him the following plan. He chose from the body of the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> five hundred men whom he knew to be the most unsparing of themselves, and asked them in the hearing of <prn id='Q666652'>Aristocrates</prn> and the rest of the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> if they were ready to die with him, avenging their country He did not know that <prn id='Q666652'>Aristocrates</prn> was a traitor, for he thought that he had fled from the battle formerly from lack of courage and through cowardice, not for any knavery; so he asked the five hundred in his presence. </p>
<p id='4.22.4'><b>4.22.4</b> When they said that they were ready, he revealed the whole plan, that he proposed at all costs to lead them against <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> during the following evening. For now was the time when the majority of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> was away at <pl id='Q16575287'>Eira</pl>, and others were scouring <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl> for booty and plunder. “If we can capture and occupy <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>,” said <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn>, “we can give back to the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> what is theirs and receive our own. If we fail, we shall die together, having done a deed for posterity to remember.” </p>
<p id='4.22.5'><b>4.22.5</b> When he said this, as many as three hundred of the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> were ready to share his enterprise. For the time they delayed their departure, as the victims were unfavorable, but on the following day they learnt that the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> had been forewarned of their secret, and that they themselves had been a second time betrayed by <prn id='Q666652'>Aristocrates</prn>. For <prn id='Q666652'>Aristocrates</prn> had at once written the designs of <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> in a letter, and having entrusted it to the slave whom he knew to be most loyal, sent him to <prn id='Q488602'>Anaxander</prn> in <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.22.6'><b>4.22.6</b> As the slave was returning, he was intercepted by some of the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl>, who had formerly been at variance with <prn id='Q666652'>Aristocrates</prn> and regarded him then with some suspicion. Having intercepted the slave they brought him before the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> and made known to the people the answer from <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl>. <prn id='Q488602'>Anaxander</prn> was writing that his retreat from the <prn id='Q3636289'>Great Trench</prn> formerly had not gone unrewarded on the part of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> and that he would receive an additional recompense for his information on the present occasion. </p>
<p id='4.22.7'><b>4.22.7</b> When this was declared to all, the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> themselves stoned <prn id='Q666652'>Aristocrates</prn> and urged the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> to join them. They looked to <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn>. But he was weeping, with his eyes fixed on the ground. So the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> stoned <prn id='Q666652'>Aristocrates</prn> to death and flung him beyond their borders without burial, and set up a tablet in the precinct of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <pl id='Q111046342'>Lycaeus</pl> with the words: <br>“Truly time hath declared justice upon an unjust king <br>And with the help of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> hath easily declared the betrayer of <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl>. <br>Hard it is for a man forsworn to hide from God. <br>Hail, king <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, and keep <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl> safe. </p>
<p id='4.23.1'><b>4.23.1</b> All the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>, who were captured about <pl id='Q16575287'>Eira</pl> or anywhere else in <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl>, were reduced by the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> to serfdom. The people of <pl id='Q2047396'>Pylos</pl> and <pl id='Q60790706'>Mothone</pl> and all who occupied the maritime district retired in ships on the capture of <pl id='Q16575287'>Eira</pl> to <pl id='Q56650616'>Cyllene</pl>, the port of the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleians</pl>. Thence they sent to the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> in <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl>, proposing to unite their forces and seek a new country to dwell in, enjoining <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> to lead them to a colony. </p>
<p id='4.23.2'><b>4.23.2</b> But he said that while he lived, he would make war on the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, as he knew well that trouble would always be brewing for <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> through him, but he gave them <prn id='Q20851109'>Gorgus</prn> and <prn id='Q31789658'>Manticlus</prn> as leaders. EuergetidYY too had retired to <pl id='Q1878690'>Mount Lykaion</pl> with the rest of the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>. From there, when he saw that <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn>' plan to seize <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> had failed, he persuaded some fifty of the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> to go back with him to <pl id='Q16575287'>Eira</pl> and attack the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, </p>
<p id='4.23.3'><b>4.23.3</b> and coming upon them while they were still plundering, he turned their celebrations of victory to grief. He then met his doom there, but <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> ordered all the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> who wished to take part in the colony to join the leaders at <pl id='Q56650616'>Cyllene</pl>. And all took part except those debarred by age or lack of funds for journeying abroad. These remained here with the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.23.4'><b>4.23.4</b> <pl id='Q16575287'>Eira</pl> was taken, and the second war between the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> and <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> completed in the <prn id='Q108823407'>archonship</prn> of <prn id='Q91012917'>Autosthenes</prn> at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, and in the first year of the <prn id='Q57337694'>twenty-eighth Olympiad</prn> [668 BCE], when <prn id='Q1074480'>Chionis</prn> the <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconian</pl> was victorious. </p>
<p id='4.23.5'><b>4.23.5</b> When the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> assembled at <pl id='Q56650616'>Cyllene</pl>, they resolved to winter there for that season, the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleians</pl> providing a market and funds. With the spring they began to debate where they should go. It was the view of <prn id='Q20851109'>Gorgus</prn> that they should occupy <pl id='Q144880'>Zacynthos</pl> off <pl id='Q178488'>Cephallenia</pl>, becoming islanders instead of mainlanders, and raid the coasts of <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconia</pl> with their ships and ravage the land. But <prn id='Q31789658'>Manticlus</prn> bade them forget <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl> and their hatred of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, and sail to <pl id='Q3760293'>Sardinia</pl> and win an island which was of the largest extent and greatest fertility. </p>
<p id='4.23.6'><b>4.23.6</b> Meantime <prn id='Q2845680'>Anaxilas</prn> sent to the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> and summoned them to <pl id='Q913582'>Italy</pl>. He was tyrant of <pl id='Q3429952'>Rhegium</pl>, third in descent from <prn id='Q2832146'>Alcidamidas</prn>, who had left <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl> for <pl id='Q3429952'>Rhegium</pl> after the death of king <prn id='Q2709649'>Aristodemus</prn> and the capture of <pl id='Q602538'>Ithome</pl>. So now this <prn id='Q2845680'>Anaxilas</prn> summoned the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>. When they came, he said that the people of <pl id='Q4023782'>Zancle</pl> were at war with him, and that they possessed a prosperous land and city well placed in <pl id='Q4951156'>Sicily</pl>; and these he said he was ready to give them and help them to conquer. When they accepted the proposal, <prn id='Q2845680'>Anaxilas</prn> then transported them to <pl id='Q4951156'>Sicily</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.23.7'><b>4.23.7</b> <pl id='Q4023782'>Zancle</pl> was originally occupied by <prn id='Q10729326'>pirates</prn>, who, as the land was uninhabited, walled off the harbor and used it as a base for their raids and cruises. Their leaders were <prn id='Q106782024'>Crataemenes</prn> a <pl id='Q13580795'>Samian</pl> and <prn id='Q1388147'>Perieres</prn> of <pl id='Q21235810'>Chalcis</pl>. Later <prn id='Q1388147'>Perieres</prn> and Crataemenes resolved to introduce other Greek settlers. </p>
<p id='4.23.8'><b>4.23.8</b> <prn id='Q2845680'>Anaxilas</prn> defeated the <pl id='Q4023782'>Zanclaeans</pl>, when they put to sea to oppose him, and the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> did the like by land, and the <pl id='Q4023782'>Zanclaeans</pl>, blockaded on land by the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> and from the sea by the fleet of the <pl id='Q3429952'>Rhegines</pl>, when their wall was carried, fled for refuge to the altars of the gods and to the temples. <prn id='Q2845680'>Anaxilas</prn>, however, advised the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> to put to death the suppliant <pl id='Q4023782'>Zanclaeans</pl> and to enslave the rest together with the women and children. </p>
<p id='4.23.9'><b>4.23.9</b> But <prn id='Q20851109'>Gorgus</prn> and <prn id='Q31789658'>Manticlus</prn> besought <prn id='Q2845680'>Anaxilas</prn> not to compel them, the victims of unholy treatment at the hands of kinsmen, to do the like to men of Greek race. After this they made the <pl id='Q4023782'>Zanclaeans</pl> rise from the altars, and exchanging pledges with them, dwelt together in common. They changed the name of the city from <pl id='Q4023782'>Zancle</pl> to <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.23.10'><b>4.23.10</b> This event took place in the <prn id='Q57337695'>twenty-ninth Olympiad</prn> [664 BCE], when <prn id='Q1074480'>Chionis</prn> the <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconian</pl> was victorious for the second time. <prn id='Q108823408'>Miltiades was archon</prn> at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>. <prn id='Q31789658'>Manticlus</prn> founded the temple of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> for the <pl id='Q4023782'>Messenians</pl>; the temple of the god is outside the walls and he is called <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> <prn id='Q31789658'>Manticlus</prn>, just as <prn id='Q3575327'>Ammon</prn> in <pl id='Q2370577'>Libya</pl> and <prn id='Q617753'>Belus</prn> in <pl id='Q5684'>Babylon</pl> are named, the latter from an <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptian</pl>, <prn id='Q617753'>Belus</prn> the son of <pl id='Q2370577'>Libya</pl>, <prn id='Q3575327'>Ammon</prn> from the shepherd-founder. Thus the exiled <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> reached the end of their wanderings. </p>
<p id='4.24.1'><b>4.24.1</b> After declining the leadership of the men setting forth to found a colony, <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> gave his sister <prn id='Q106782065'>Hagnagora</prn> in marriage to <prn id='Q106782103'>Tharyx</prn> at <pl id='Q7623270'>Phigalia</pl>, and his daughters, both the eldest and the next in age, to <prn id='Q106782125'>Damothoidas</prn> of <pl id='Q5860679'>Lepreum</pl> and <prn id='Q20493479'>Theopompus</prn> of <pl id='Q3562285'>Heraea</pl>. He himself went to <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> to enquire of the god. The reply that was given to <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> is not recorded, </p>
<p id='4.24.2'><b>4.24.2</b> but when <prn id='Q11916513'>Damagetus</prn> the <pl id='Q13533316'>Rhodian</pl>, who reigned at <pl id='Q29963099'>Ialysos</pl>, came to <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> and asked whence he should take a wife, the <prn id='Q220344'>Pythia</prn> bade him take a daughter of the bravest of the Greeks. As <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> had a third daughter, he married her, considering that <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> was by far the bravest of the Greeks of that age. <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn>, coming to <pl id='Q13533316'>Rhodes</pl> with his daughter, purposed to go up from there to <pl id='Q232615'>Sardis</pl> to <prn id='Q640203'>Ardys</prn> the son of <prn id='Q312537'>Gyges</prn>, and to <pl id='Q696193'>Ecbatana</pl> of the <pl id='Q3853673'>Medes</pl> to king <prn id='Q332557'>Phraortes</prn>. </p>
<p id='4.24.3'><b>4.24.3</b> But ere that he was overtaken by illness and death, for no further misfortune was to befall the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> at the hands of <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn>. On his death <prn id='Q11916513'>Damagetus</prn> and the <pl id='Q13533316'>Rhodians</pl> built him a splendid tomb and paid honor to him thenceforward. I omit what is recorded of the <prn id='Q1208207'>Diagoridae</prn> in <pl id='Q13533316'>Rhodes</pl>, as they are called, a line sprung from <prn id='Q777201'>Diagoras</prn> the son of <prn id='Q106630464'>Damagetus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q115473406'>Dorieus</prn>, who was the son of <prn id='Q11916513'>Damagetus</prn> and of the daughter of <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn>, lest it should seem to be irrelevant. </p>
<p id='4.24.4'><b>4.24.4</b> Now the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, gaining possession of <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl>, divided it all among themselves, except the land belonging to the people of <pl id='Q16488997'>Asine</pl>; but they gave <pl id='Q60790706'>Mothone</pl> to the men of <pl id='Q56399740'>Nauplia</pl>, who had recently been driven from their town by the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.24.5'><b>4.24.5</b> The <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> who were captured in the country, reduced by force to the position of serfs, were later moved to revolt from the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> in the <prn id='Q57337762'>seventy-ninth Olympiad</prn> [464 BCE], when <prn id='Q8043663'>Xenophon</prn> the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthian</pl> was victorious. <prn id='Q91012972'>Archimedes was archon</prn> at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>. The occasion which they found for the revolt was this. Certain <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> who had been condemned to death on some charge fled as suppliants to <pl id='Q33119266'>Taenarum</pl> but the board of ephors dragged them from the altar there and put them to death. </p>
<p id='4.24.6'><b>4.24.6</b> As the <pl id='Q5690'>Spartans</pl> paid no heed to their being suppliants, the wrath of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> came upon them, and the god razed all their city to the ground. At this disaster all the serfs who were of <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> origin seceded to Mount <pl id='Q602538'>Ithome</pl>. Against them the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, amongst other allies, called to their assistance <prn id='Q218102'>Cimon</prn> the son of <prn id='Q210350'>Miltiades</prn>, their patron in <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, and an <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> force. But when the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> arrived, they seem to have regarded them with suspicion that they were likely to promote revolution, and as a result of this suspicion to have soon dismissed them from <pl id='Q602538'>Ithome</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.24.7'><b>4.24.7</b> The <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, realizing the feelings of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> towards them, made friends therefore with the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>, and gave <pl id='Q782278'>Naupactus</pl> to the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> besieged in <pl id='Q602538'>Ithome</pl>, when they were allowed to depart under a truce. They had taken <pl id='Q782278'>Naupactus</pl> from the <pl id='Q4894785'>Locrians</pl> adjoining <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolia</pl>, called the <pl id='Q4894785'>Ozolian</pl>. The retirement of the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> from <pl id='Q602538'>Ithome</pl> was secured by the strength of the place; also the <prn id='Q220344'>Pythia</prn> announced to the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> that assuredly they would be punished if they committed a crime against the suppliant of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> of <pl id='Q602538'>Ithome</pl>. For this reason then they were allowed to go from <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnese</pl> under a truce. </p>
<p id='4.25.1'><b>4.25.1</b> When they occupied <pl id='Q782278'>Naupactus</pl> it was not enough for them to have received a city and country at the hands of the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, but they were filled with a strong desire to show that they had won something notable with their own hands. Knowing that the <pl id='Q416070'>Acarnanians</pl> of <pl id='Q2016870'>Oeniadae</pl> possessed a good land and were continually at war with the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, they marched against them. They had no numerical advantage, but defeating them by their superior courage, they shut them up in the fortress and besieged them. </p>
<p id='4.25.2'><b>4.25.2</b> They neglected no human invention in the matter of siege-craft, tried to carry the town by raising scaling-ladders, mined the walls, and by bringing up such engines as could be made ready at short notice proceeded with the destruction of the fortifications. The inhabitants, fearing that if the city were taken they would be put to death and their wives and children enslaved, elected to withdraw on terms. </p>
<p id='4.25.3'><b>4.25.3</b> The <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> held the town and occupied the country for about a year. In the following year the <pl id='Q416070'>Acarnanians</pl> collected a force from all their towns and discussed an attack on <pl id='Q782278'>Naupactus</pl>. They rejected this, as they saw that their line of march would be through the <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolians</pl>, who were always their enemies; moreover they suspected that the men of <pl id='Q782278'>Naupactus</pl> possessed a fleet, which was the fact; and while they commanded the sea, it was impossible to achieve anything of importance with a land force. </p>
<p id='4.25.4'><b>4.25.4</b> So they changed their plans and at once turned on the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> in <pl id='Q2016870'>Oeniadae</pl> and prepared to besiege them, for they never supposed that men so few in number would show such desperate courage as to fight against the full levy of the <pl id='Q416070'>Acarnanians</pl>. The <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> had previously prepared food and all else that was requisite, expecting to stand a long siege. </p>
<p id='4.25.5'><b>4.25.5</b> But they were determined before the siege was formed to fight a battle in the open, and being <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>, who had not been surpassed in valor even by <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, but in fortune only, were determined not to be dismayed at the horde which had come from <pl id='Q416070'>Acarnania</pl>. They recalled the achievement of the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> at <pl id='Q31900'>Marathon</pl>, how thirty myriad <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl> had been destroyed by men not numbering ten thousand. </p>
<p id='4.25.6'><b>4.25.6</b> So they joined battle with the <pl id='Q416070'>Acarnanians</pl>, and the course of the battle is said to have been thus. The enemy, being far superior in numbers, had no difficulty in surrounding the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>, except where prevented by the gates in the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> rear and by the zealous help of their men posted on the wall. Here they could not be surrounded, but the <pl id='Q416070'>Acarnanians</pl> enveloped both their flanks and shot volleys at them from all sides. </p>
<p id='4.25.7'><b>4.25.7</b> The <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>, in close formation, whenever they charged the <pl id='Q416070'>Acarnanians</pl> in a body, threw the enemy at that point into confusion, killing and wounding many of them, but they could not effect a complete rout. For wherever the <pl id='Q416070'>Acarnanians</pl> saw a part of their own line being broken by the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> they went to the support of their harassed troops at this point and checked the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>, overwhelming them by numbers. </p>
<p id='4.25.8'><b>4.25.8</b> The <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>, beaten back and again attempting to pierce the massed troops of the <pl id='Q416070'>Acarnanians</pl> at another point, would meet with the same result. Wherever they attacked, they threw the enemy into confusion and drove them a short distance, but as the <pl id='Q416070'>Acarnanians</pl> again streamed eagerly to this point, they were driven back against their will. The battle was evenly contested until evening, but when at nightfall the <pl id='Q416070'>Acarnanians</pl> received reinforcements from their cities, the blockade of the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> was formed. </p>
<p id='4.25.9'><b>4.25.9</b> They had no fear of the wall being taken by assault, either by the <pl id='Q416070'>Acarnanians</pl> scaling it or by themselves being forced to abandon their posts. But in the eighth month all their provisions alike had been consumed. </p>
<p id='4.25.10'><b>4.25.10</b> They shouted to the <pl id='Q416070'>Acarnanians</pl> from the wall in mockery that their supplies would not fail them until the tenth year of the siege, but they themselves sallied out of <pl id='Q2016870'>Oeniadae</pl> at the time of the first sleep. Their escape became known to the <pl id='Q416070'>Acarnanians</pl> and they were compelled to fight, losing some three hundred and killing still more of the enemy. But the greater part of them got through the <pl id='Q416070'>Acarnanians</pl>, and reaching the territory of the <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolians</pl>, who were their friends, arrived safely at <pl id='Q782278'>Naupactus</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.26.1'><b>4.26.1</b> Afterwards, as at all times, they were stirred by their hatred against the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, and provided the most striking example of their hostility towards them in the war which took place between the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesians</pl> and the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>. For they offered <pl id='Q782278'>Naupactus</pl> as a base against <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnese</pl>, and <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> slingers from <pl id='Q782278'>Naupactus</pl> helped to capture the <pl id='Q5690'>Spartans</pl> cut off in <pl id='Q1303524'>Sphacteria</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.26.2'><b>4.26.2</b> When the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> reverse at <pl id='Q404513'>Aegospotami</pl> took place, the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, having command of the sea, then drove the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> from <pl id='Q782278'>Naupactus</pl>; they went to their kinsmen in <pl id='Q4951156'>Sicily</pl> and to <pl id='Q3429952'>Rhegium</pl>, but the majority came to <pl id='Q2370577'>Libya</pl> and to the <pl id='Q819047'>Euesperitae</pl> there, who had suffered severely in war with barbarian neighbors and were inviting any Greek to join them. So the majority of the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> went to them, their leader being <prn id='Q106634788'>Comon</prn>, who had commanded them in <pl id='Q1303524'>Sphacteria</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.26.3'><b>4.26.3</b> A year before the victory of the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> at <pl id='Q2606004'>Leuctra</pl>, heaven foretold their return to <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnese</pl> to the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>. It is said that in <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl> on the Straits the priest of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> saw a vision in a dream: it seemed that <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> <prn id='Q31789658'>Manticlus</prn> was bidden by <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> as a guest to <pl id='Q602538'>Ithome</pl>. Also among the <pl id='Q819047'>Euesperitae</pl> <prn id='Q106634788'>Comon</prn> dreamt that he lay with his dead mother, but that afterwards she came to life again. He hoped that as the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> had recovered their seapower, they would be restored to <pl id='Q782278'>Naupactus</pl>. But the dream really indicated the recovery of <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.26.4'><b>4.26.4</b> Not long afterwards the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> suffered at <pl id='Q2606004'>Leuctra</pl> the disaster that had long been due. For at the end of the oracle given to <prn id='Q2709649'>Aristodemus</prn>, who reigned over the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>, are the words: “Act as fate wills, destruction comes on this man before that,” signifying that he and the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> must suffer evil at the present, but that hereafter destruction would overtake <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.26.5'><b>4.26.5</b> Then after their victory at <pl id='Q2606004'>Leuctra</pl> the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> sent messengers to <pl id='Q913582'>Italy</pl>, <pl id='Q4951156'>Sicily</pl> and to the <pl id='Q819047'>Euesperitae</pl>, and summoned the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> to <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnese</pl> from every other quarter where they might be, and they, with longing for their country and through the hatred which had ever remained with them for the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, assembled quicker than could have been expected. </p>
<p id='4.26.6'><b>4.26.6</b> To <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn> it seemed in no way easy to found a city that could resist the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, nor could he discover where in the land to build it. For the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> refused to settle again in <pl id='Q2537068'>Andania</pl> and <pl id='Q60790408'>Oechalia</pl>, because their disasters had befallen them when they dwelt there. To <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn> in his difficulty it is said that an ancient man, closely resembling a priest of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>, appeared in the night and said: “My gift to thee is that thou shalt conquer whomsoever thou dost assail; and when thou dost pass from men, <pl id='Q11225429'>Theban</pl>, I will cause thy name to be unforgotten and give thee glory. But do thou restore to the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> their fatherland and cities, for now the wrath of the <prn id='Q190103'>Dioscuri</prn> against them hath ceased.” </p>
<p id='4.26.7'><b>4.26.7</b> This he said to <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn>, and revealed this to <prn id='Q31789674'>Epiteles</prn> the son of <prn id='Q317089'>Aeschines</prn>, who had been chosen by the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> to be their general and to refound <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl>. He was bidden by the dream, wherever he found yew and myrtle growing on <pl id='Q602538'>Ithome</pl>, to dig between them and recover the old woman, for, shut in her brazen chamber, she was overcome and well-nigh fainting. When day dawned, <prn id='Q31789674'>Epiteles</prn> went to the appointed place, and as he dug, came upon a brazen urn. </p>
<p id='4.26.8'><b>4.26.8</b> He took it at once to <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn>, told him the dream and bade him remove the lid and see what was within. <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn>, after sacrifice and prayer to the vision that had appeared, opened the urn and having opened it found some tin foil, very thin, rolled like a book. On it were inscribed the mysteries of the <prn id='Q30025797'>Great Goddesses</prn>, and this was the pledge deposited by <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn>. They say that the man who appeared to <prn id='Q31789674'>Epiteles</prn> and <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn> in their sleep was <prn id='Q4207037'>Caucon</prn>, who came from <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> to <prn id='Q1924155'>Messene</prn> the daughter of <prn id='Q2632716'>Triopas</prn> at <pl id='Q2537068'>Andania</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.27.1'><b>4.27.1</b> The wrath of the sons of <prn id='Q192946'>Tyndareus</prn> against the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> began before the battle in <pl id='Q15829811'>Stenyclerus</pl>, and arose, I think, for the following reason. Panormus and Gonippus of <pl id='Q2537068'>Andania</pl>, young men in the bloom of youth, were close friends in all things, and marched together into battle and on raids into <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconia</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.27.2'><b>4.27.2</b> The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> were keeping a feast of the <prn id='Q190103'>Dioscuri</prn> in camp and had turned to drinking and sports after the midday meal, when Gonippus and Panormus appeared to them, riding on the finest <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn> and dressed in white tunics and scarlet cloaks, with caps on their heads and spears in their hands. When the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> saw them they bowed down and prayed, thinking that the <prn id='Q190103'>Dioscuri</prn> themselves had come to their sacrifice. </p>
<p id='4.27.3'><b>4.27.3</b> When once they had come among them, the youths rode right through them, striking with their spears, and when many had been killed, returned to <pl id='Q2537068'>Andania</pl>, having outraged the sacrifice to the <prn id='Q190103'>Dioscuri</prn>. It was this, in my view, that roused the <prn id='Q190103'>Dioscuri</prn> to their hatred of the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>. But now, as the dream declared to <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn>, the <prn id='Q190103'>Dioscuri</prn> no longer opposed the return of the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.27.4'><b>4.27.4</b> <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn> was most strongly drawn to the foundation by the oracles of <prn id='Q708459'>Bacis</prn>, who was inspired by the <prn id='Q373916'>Nymphs</prn> and left prophecies regarding others of the Greeks as well as the return of the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>: “Then indeed shall the bright bloom of <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> perish and <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl> again shall be inhabited for all time.” I have discovered that <prn id='Q708459'>Bacis</prn> also told in what manner <pl id='Q16575287'>Eira</pl> would be captured, and this too is one of his oracles: “The men of <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl> o'ercome by the thunder's roll and spouting rain. </p>
<p id='4.27.5'><b>4.27.5</b> When the mysteries were recovered, all who were of the priestly family set them down in books. As <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn> considered the spot where the city of the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> now stands most convenient for the foundation, he ordered enquiry to be made by the seers if the favour of the gods would follow him here. When they announced that the offerings were auspicious, he began preparations for the foundation, ordering stone to be brought, and summoning men skilled in laying out streets and in building houses, temples, and ring-walls. </p>
<p id='4.27.6'><b>4.27.6</b> When all was in readiness, victims being provided by the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl>, <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn> himself and the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> then sacrificed to <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> and <prn id='Q107243256'>Ismenian</prn> <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> in the accustomed manner, the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> to <prn id='Q55535046'>Argive</prn> <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> and <prn id='Q107288745'>Nemean</prn> <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> to <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> of <prn id='Q107247012'>Ithome</prn> and the <prn id='Q190103'>Dioscuri</prn>, and their priests to the <prn id='Q30025797'>Great Goddesses</prn> and <prn id='Q4207037'>Caucon</prn>. And together they summoned heroes to return and dwell with them, first <prn id='Q1924155'>Messene</prn> the daughter of <prn id='Q2632716'>Triopas</prn>, after her <prn id='Q939149'>Eurytus</prn>, <prn id='Q578378'>Aphareus</prn> and his children, and of the <prn id='Q828084'>Heraclidae</prn> <prn id='Q1788026'>Cresphontes</prn> and <prn id='Q406443'>Aepytus</prn>. But the loudest summons from all alike was to <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn>. </p>
<p id='4.27.7'><b>4.27.7</b> For that day they were engaged in sacrifice and prayer, but on the following days they raised the circuit of the walls, and within built houses and the temples. They worked to the sound of music, but only from <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotian</pl> and <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl> flutes, and the tunes of <prn id='Q3944390'>Sacadas</prn> and <prn id='Q1240680'>Pronomus</prn> were brought into keen competition. The city itself was given the name <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl>, but they founded other towns. The men of <pl id='Q56399740'>Nauplia</pl> were not disturbed at <pl id='Q60790706'>Mothone</pl>, </p>
<p id='4.27.8'><b>4.27.8</b> and they allowed the people of <pl id='Q16488997'>Asine</pl> to remain in their home, remembering their kindness when they refused to join the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> in the war against them. The men of <pl id='Q56399740'>Nauplia</pl> on the return of the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> to <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnese</pl> brought them such gifts as they had, and while praying continually to the gods for their return begged the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> to grant protection to themselves. </p>
<p id='4.27.9'><b>4.27.9</b> The <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> returned to <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnese</pl> and recovered their own land two hundred and eighty-seven years after the capture of <pl id='Q16575287'>Eira</pl>, in the <prn id='Q91013027'>archonship of Dyscinetus</prn> (sic: Dyskinetos) at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> and in the third year of the <prn id='Q57337793'>hundred and second Olympiad</prn> [369 BCE], when <prn id='Q17115203'>Damon</prn> of <pl id='Q602564'>Thurii</pl> was victorious for the second time. It was no short time for the <pl id='Q742538'>Plataeans</pl> that they were in exile from their country, and for the <pl id='Q173148'>Delians</pl> when they settled in <pl id='Q3605584'>Adramyttium</pl> after being expelled from their island by the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> [and Orchomenians]. </p>
<p id='4.27.10'><b>4.27.10</b> The <prn id='Q1065225'>Minyae</prn>, driven by the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> from <pl id='Q543895'>Orchomenos</pl> after the battle of <pl id='Q2606004'>Leuctra</pl>, were restored to <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl> by <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn> the son of <prn id='Q313907'>Amyntas</prn>, as were also the <pl id='Q742538'>Plataeans</pl>. When <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn> had destroyed the city of the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> themselves, <prn id='Q207183'>Cassander</prn> the son of <prn id='Q204760'>Antipater</prn> rebuilt it after a few years. The exile of the <pl id='Q742538'>Plataeans</pl> seems to have lasted the longest of those mentioned, but even this was not for more than two generations. </p>
<p id='4.27.11'><b>4.27.11</b> But the wanderings of the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> outside the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnese</pl> lasted almost three hundred years, during which it is clear that they did not depart in any way from their local customs, and did not lose their <prn id='Q285494'>Doric</prn> dialect, but even to our day they have retained the purest <prn id='Q285494'>Doric</prn> in <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnese</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.28.1'><b>4.28.1</b> After their return they had nothing to fear at first from the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. For the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, restrained by fear of the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl>, submitted to the foundation of <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl> and to the gathering of the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> into one city. But when the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocian</pl> or, as it is called, the Sacred War caused the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> to withdraw from <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnese</pl>, the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> regained courage and could no longer refrain from attacking the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.28.2'><b>4.28.2</b> The <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> maintained the war with the help of the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> and <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl>, and asked the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> for help. They refused to join in an attack on <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconia</pl>, but promised to render assistance in person if the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> began war and invaded <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl>. Finally the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> formed an alliance with <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn> the son of <prn id='Q313907'>Amyntas</prn> and the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl>; it was this, they say, that prevented them from taking part in the battle which the Greeks fought at <pl id='Q13574678'>Chaeroneia</pl>. They refused, however, to bear arms against the Greeks. </p>
<p id='4.28.3'><b>4.28.3</b> After the death of <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn>, when the Greeks had raised a second war against the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl>, the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> took part, as I have shown earlier in my account of <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl>. They did not join the Greeks against the Gauls, as <prn id='Q930518'>Cleonymus</prn> and the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> refused to grant them a truce. </p>
<p id='4.28.4'><b>4.28.4</b> Not long afterwards the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> occupied <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>, employing strategy and daring alike. The <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleians</pl> in the earliest times were the most law-abiding of the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesians</pl>, but when <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn> the son of <prn id='Q313907'>Amyntas</prn> did all the harm to Greece that has been related, he also bribed the leading men in <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>; the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleians</pl> were divided by factions for the first time and came to blows, it is said. </p>
<p id='4.28.5'><b>4.28.5</b> Henceforward it was likely to be more easy for quarrels to arise among men whose counsels were divided on account of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, and they arrived at civil war. Learning this, the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> were preparing to assist their partisans in <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>. While they were being organized in squadrons and distributed in companies, a thousand picked <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> troops arrived hurriedly at <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> with <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconian</pl> blazons on their shields. </p>
<p id='4.28.6'><b>4.28.6</b> Seeing their shields, all the Laconising party in <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> thought their supporters had arrived and received them into the fortress. But having obtained admission in this way, the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> drove out the supporters of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> and made over the city to their own partisans. </p>
<p id='4.28.7'><b>4.28.7</b> The trick is <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>'s, but the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> plainly imitated it opportunely, for <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> represents <prn id='Q186271'>Patroclus</prn> in the <prn id='Q8275'>Iliad</prn> clad in the arms of <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn>, and says that the barbarians were filled with the belief that it was <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn> attacking them, and that their front ranks were thrown into confusion. Other stratagems are the invention of <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>, the coming of the two Greek spies by night among the <pl id='Q22647'>Trojans</pl>, instead of one and later a man coming to <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl>, who pretends to be a deserter but actually is to find out their secrets. </p>
<p id='4.28.8'><b>4.28.8</b> Again, the <pl id='Q22647'>Trojans</pl> who, through youth or years were not of fighting age, he posted as garrison of the walls, while the men of military age were encamped against the Greeks. The wounded Greeks in <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> arm the fighting men, so that even they may not be altogether idle. Indeed <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>'s ideas have proved useful to men in every matter. </p>
<p id='4.29.1'><b>4.29.1</b> Not long after the affair at <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>, the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> and <prn id='Q1185467'>Demetrius</prn> the son of <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn>, son of <prn id='Q313847'>Demetrius</prn>, captured <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl>. I have already, in my account of <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl>, narrated most of the crimes of <prn id='Q207363'>Perseus</prn> against <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn> himself and against <prn id='Q1185467'>Demetrius</prn> the son of <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn>. These are the facts relating to the capture of <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.29.2'><b>4.29.2</b> <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn> was in need of money, and as it was necessary to raise it at all costs, he sent <prn id='Q1185467'>Demetrius</prn> with a fleet to <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnese</pl>. He put in to one of the less frequented harbors of the <pl id='Q12649101'>Argolid</pl>, and at once marched his army by the shortest route to <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl>. With an advance guard consisting of all the light-armed troops who knew the road to <pl id='Q602538'>Ithome</pl>, he succeeded just before dawn in scaling the wall unnoticed at a point where it lay between the city and the peak of <pl id='Q602538'>Ithome</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.29.3'><b>4.29.3</b> When day dawned and the inhabitants had realized the danger that beset them, they were at first under the impression that the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> had forced an entry into the town, and attacked them more recklessly owing to their ancient hatred. But when they discovered from their equipment and speech that it was the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> and <prn id='Q1185467'>Demetrius</prn> the son of <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn>, they were filled with great fear, when they considered the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonian</pl> training in warfare and the good fortune which they saw that they enjoyed in all their ventures. </p>
<p id='4.29.4'><b>4.29.4</b> Nevertheless the magnitude of the present evil caused them to display a courage beyond their strength, also they were inspired with hope for the best, since it seemed not without divine help that they had accomplished their return to <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnese</pl> after so long an absence. So the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> in the town went against the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> full of courage, and the garrison on the acropolis attacked from the high ground above. </p>
<p id='4.29.5'><b>4.29.5</b> In like manner the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl>, brave and experienced troops, at first offered a firm resistance. But worn out by their march, attacked by the men and bombarded with tiles and stones by the women, they took to flight in disorder. The majority were pushed over the precipices and killed, for <pl id='Q602538'>Ithome</pl> is very steep at this point. A few escaped by throwing away their arms. </p>
<p id='4.29.6'><b>4.29.6</b> The <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> refrained at first from joining the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaean</pl> league for the following reason, I think. When <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q403377'>Aeacides</prn> made war on the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, they came unasked to their assistance, and as a result of this service a more peaceful disposition towards them came to be established at <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>. Therefore they were unwilling to revive the feud by joining the league, which was openly declared the bitterest enemy of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.29.7'><b>4.29.7</b> I realize, as of course did the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>, that even without their joining the league the policy of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> was hostile to the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. For the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> and the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadian</pl> group formed not the smallest element in the league. However, in the course of time they joined the league. And not long afterwards <prn id='Q310811'>Cleomenes</prn> the son of <prn id='Q173795'>Leonidas</prn>, son of <prn id='Q930518'>Cleonymus</prn>, captured the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadian</pl> <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl> in peace-time. </p>
<p id='4.29.8'><b>4.29.8</b> Of the people of <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl> who were caught in the city, some were killed at the time of its capture, but <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn> the son of <prn id='Q88466293'>Craugis</prn> and all who withdrew with him (the number of the citizens who escaped is said to have been more than two-thirds) were received by the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>, who for the sake of the former services rendered by the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> in the time of <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> and again at the founding of <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl> now repaid the like. </p>
<p id='4.29.9'><b>4.29.9</b> Such, it would seem, are the vicissitudes of human affairs, that it was the will of heaven that the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> should in their turn preserve the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl>, and what is still more surprising, that they should capture <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>. For they fought against <prn id='Q310811'>Cleomenes</prn> at <pl id='Q59431661'>Sellasia</pl> and joined with <prn id='Q317331'>Aratus</prn> and the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> to capture <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.29.10'><b>4.29.10</b> When the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> were rid of <prn id='Q310811'>Cleomenes</prn> there rose to power a tyrant <prn id='Q1269430'>Machanidas</prn>, and after his death a second tyrant arose in <prn id='Q312689'>Nabis</prn>. As he plundered human property and robbed temples alike, he amassed vast wealth in a short time and with it raised an army. This <prn id='Q312689'>Nabis</prn> seized <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl>, but when <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn> and the people of <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl> arrived during the same night, </p>
<p id='4.29.11'><b>4.29.11</b> the <pl id='Q5690'>Spartan</pl> tyrant retired on terms. But the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> after this, having some quarrel with the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>, invaded them with all their forces and ravaged most of the country. On a second occasion they mustered when the corn was ripe to invade <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl>. But <prn id='Q16190826'>Deinocrates</prn>, the head of the government, who had been chosen to command the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> on that occasion, compelled <prn id='Q2065138'>Lycortas</prn> and his force to retire without effecting anything, by occupying beforehand the passes from <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl> into <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl> with the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> from the city and troops from the surrounding districts that came to their assistance. </p>
<p id='4.29.12'><b>4.29.12</b> <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn> arrived with a few cavalry some time later than the force with <prn id='Q2065138'>Lycortas</prn> and had been unable to obtain any news of it; the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>, having the advantage of the high ground, defeated him and took him alive. I will narrate the manner of <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn>'s capture and death in my account of <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl> later. The <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>, who were responsible for his death, were punished and <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl> was again brought into the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaean</pl> league. </p>
<p id='4.29.13'><b>4.29.13</b> Hitherto my account has dealt with the many sufferings of the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>, how fate scattered them to the ends of the earth, far from <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnese</pl>, and afterwards brought them safely home to their own country. Let us now turn to a description of the country and cities. </p>
<p id='4.30.1'><b>4.30.1</b> There is in our time a city <pl id='Q5860118'>Abia</pl> in <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl> on the coast, some twenty stades distant from the <pl id='Q25023367'>Choerius</pl> valley. They say that this was formerly called <pl id='Q5860118'>Ire</pl> and was one of the seven cities which <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> says that <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn> promised to <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn>. When <prn id='Q847268'>Hyllus</prn> and the <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn> were defeated by the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, it is said that <prn id='Q320830'>Abia</prn>, nurse of <prn id='Q12750238'>Glenus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, withdrew to <pl id='Q5860118'>Ire</pl>, and settling there built a temple to <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, and that afterwards for this reason <prn id='Q1788026'>Cresphontes</prn>, amongst other honors assigned to her, renamed the city after <prn id='Q320830'>Abia</prn>. There was a notable sanctuary of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> here, and also of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>. </p>
<p id='4.30.2'><b>4.30.2</b> <pl id='Q1571214'>Pharae</pl> is seventy stades distant from <pl id='Q5860118'>Abia</pl>. On the road is a salt spring. The Emperor <prn id='Q1405'>Augustus</prn> caused the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> of <pl id='Q1571214'>Pharae</pl> to be incorporated in <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconia</pl>. The founder <prn id='Q1246244'>Pharis</prn> is said to have been the son of <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> and <prn id='Q18552931'>Phylodameia</prn> the daughter of <prn id='Q210883'>Danaus</prn>. He had no male children, but a daughter <prn id='Q2401584'>Telegone</prn>. <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>, tracing her descendants in the <prn id='Q8275'>Iliad</prn>, says that twins, <prn id='Q1343776'>Crethon</prn> and <prn id='Q1756679'>Ortilochus</prn>, were born to <prn id='Q1226883'>Diocles</prn>, <prn id='Q1226883'>Diocles</prn> himself being the son of <prn id='Q1446575'>Ortilochus</prn> son of <prn id='Q911084'>Alpheius</prn>. He makes no reference to <prn id='Q2401584'>Telegone</prn>, who in the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> account bore <prn id='Q1446575'>Ortilochus</prn> to <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.30.3'><b>4.30.3</b> I heard also at <pl id='Q1571214'>Pharae</pl> that besides the twins a daughter <prn id='Q576173'>Anticleia</prn> was born to <prn id='Q1226883'>Diocles</prn>, and that her children were <prn id='Q1723235'>Nicomachus</prn> and <prn id='Q1538180'>Gorgasus</prn>, by <prn id='Q674319'>Machaon</prn> the son of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>. They remained at <pl id='Q1571214'>Pharae</pl> and succeeded to the kingdom on the death of <prn id='Q1226883'>Diocles</prn>. The power of healing diseases and curing the maimed has remained with them to this day, and in return for this, sacrifices and votive offerings are brought to their sanctuary. The people of <pl id='Q1571214'>Pharae</pl> possess also a temple of <prn id='Q213440'>Tyche</prn> (fortune) and an ancient image. </p>
<p id='4.30.4'><b>4.30.4</b> <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> is the first whom I know to have mentioned <prn id='Q213440'>Fortune</prn> in his poems. He did so in the Hymn to <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>, where he enumerates the <prn id='Q20575671'>daughters</prn> of <prn id='Q161419'>Ocean</prn>, telling how they played with <prn id='Q45967'>Kore</prn> the daughter of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>, and making <prn id='Q213440'>Tyche</prn> one of them. The lines are: “We all in a lovely meadow, <prn id='Q106634143'>Leucippe</prn>, <prn id='Q2495582'>Phaeno</prn>, <prn id='Q1438693'>Electre</prn> and <prn id='Q106620096'>Ianthe</prn>, <prn id='Q106079953'>Melobosis</prn> and <prn id='Q213440'>Tyche</prn> and <prn id='Q6048797'>Ocyrhoe</prn> with face like a flower. </p>
<p id='4.30.5'><b>4.30.5</b> He said nothing further about this goddess being the mightiest of gods in human affairs and displaying greatest strength, as in the <prn id='Q8275'>Iliad</prn> he represented <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> and <prn id='Q3725417'>Enyo</prn> as supreme in war, and <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> feared in childbirth, and <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> heeding the affairs of marriage. But he makes no other mention of <prn id='Q213440'>Fortune</prn>. </p>
<p id='4.30.6'><b>4.30.6</b> <prn id='Q852011'>Bupalus</prn> a skilful temple-architect and carver of images, who made the statue of <prn id='Q213440'>Fortune</prn> at <pl id='Q1379299'>Smyrna</pl>, was the first whom we know to have represented her with the heavenly sphere upon her head and carrying in one hand the horn of <prn id='Q107785'>Amaltheia</prn>, as the Greeks call it, representing her functions to this extent. The poems of <prn id='Q134929'>Pindar</prn> later contained references to <prn id='Q213440'>Fortune</prn>, and it is he who called her Pherepolis (Supporter of the City). </p>
<p id='4.31.1'><b>4.31.1</b> Not far from <pl id='Q1571214'>Pharae</pl> is a grove of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> <prn id='Q671534'>Carneius</prn> and a spring of water in it. <pl id='Q1571214'>Pharae</pl> is about six stades from the sea. Eighty stades on the road which leads thence into the interior of <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl> is the city of the <pl id='Q9090574'>Thuriatae</pl>, which they say had the name <pl id='Q16483465'>Antheia</pl> in <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>'s poems. <prn id='Q1405'>Augustus</prn> gave <pl id='Q9090574'>Thuria</pl> into the possession of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> of <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>. For when <prn id='Q1405'>Augustus</prn> was emperor of the Romans, <prn id='Q51673'>Antony</prn>, himself a Roman, made war upon him and was joined by the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> and the rest of the Greeks, because the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> were on the side of <prn id='Q1405'>Augustus</prn>. </p>
<p id='4.31.2'><b>4.31.2</b> For this reason <prn id='Q1405'>Augustus</prn> punished the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> and the rest of his adversaries, some more, some less. The people of <pl id='Q9090574'>Thuria</pl> left their town, which lay originally on high ground, and came down to live in the plain. Nevertheless the upper town is not entirely deserted, but there are remains of the wall and a temple there, called the temple of the Syrian Goddess. A river called Aris flows past the town in the plain. </p>
<p id='4.31.3'><b>4.31.3</b> In the interior is a village <pl id='Q11910884'>Calamae</pl> and a place <pl id='Q48781604'>Limnae</pl>, where is a <pl id='Q107161014'>sanctuary of Limnatis</pl> <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>. They say that <prn id='Q1258032'>Teleclus</prn> king of <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> met his end here. </p>
<p id='4.31.4'><b>4.31.4</b> On the road from <pl id='Q9090574'>Thuria</pl> towards <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl> are the springs of the <pl id='Q3100663'>Pamisus</pl>, at which little children find cures. A road turns to the left from the springs, and after some forty stades is the city of the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> under <pl id='Q602538'>Ithome</pl>. It is enclosed not only by Mount <pl id='Q602538'>Ithome</pl>, but on the side towards the <pl id='Q3100663'>Pamisos</pl> by Mount <pl id='Q25094179'>Eva</pl>. The mountain is said to have obtained its name from the fact that the Bacchic cry of “Evoe” was first uttered here by <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> and his attendant women. </p>
<p id='4.31.5'><b>4.31.5</b> Round <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl> is a wall, the whole circuit of which is built of stone, with towers and battlements upon it. I have not seen the walls at <pl id='Q5684'>Babylon</pl> or the walls of <prn id='Q506781'>Memnon</prn> at <pl id='Q180773'>Susa</pl> in <pl id='Q3746183'>Persia</pl>, nor have I heard the account of any eye-witness; but the walls at <pl id='Q12872250'>Ambrossos</pl> in <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl>, at <pl id='Q23725'>Byzantium</pl> and at <pl id='Q13533316'>Rhodes</pl>, all of them the most strongly fortified places, are not so strong as the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> wall. </p>
<p id='4.31.6'><b>4.31.6</b> The <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> possess a statue of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> the <prn id='Q2303797'>Saviour</prn> in the agora and a fountain <prn id='Q9160370'>Arsinoe</prn>. It received its name from the daughter of <prn id='Q2316900'>Leucippus</prn> and is fed from a source called Clepsydra. There are sanctuaries of the gods <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> and <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>, and, what is most deserving of mention, a statue of the <prn id='Q334486'>Mother of the Gods</prn>, of <pl id='Q65040323'>Parian</pl> marble, the work of <prn id='Q1158742'>Damophon</prn>, the artist who repaired the <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> with extreme accuracy when the ivory parted. Honors have been granted to him by the people of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.31.7'><b>4.31.7</b> By <prn id='Q1158742'>Damophon</prn> too is the so-called <prn id='Q110800630'>Laphria</prn> at <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl>. The cult came to be established among them in the following way: Among the people of <pl id='Q750313'>Calydon</pl>, <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, who was worshipped by them above all the gods, had the title <prn id='Q110800630'>Laphria</prn>, and the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> who received <pl id='Q782278'>Naupactus</pl> from the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, being at that time close neighbors of the <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolians</pl>, adopted her from the people of <pl id='Q750313'>Calydon</pl>. I will describe her appearance in another place. The name <prn id='Q110800630'>Laphria</prn> spread only to the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> and to the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> of <pl id='Q133123'>Patrae</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.31.8'><b>4.31.8</b> But all cities worship <pl id='Q43018'>Artemis of Ephesus</pl>, and individuals hold her in honor above all the gods. The reason, in my view, is the renown of the <prn id='Q134154'>Amazons</prn>, who traditionally dedicated the image, also the extreme antiquity of this sanctuary. Three other points as well have contributed to her renown, the size of the <pl id='Q43018'>temple</pl>, surpassing all buildings among men, the eminence of the city of the <pl id='Q47611'>Ephesians</pl> and the renown of the goddess who dwells there. </p>
<p id='4.31.9'><b>4.31.9</b> The <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> have a temple erected to <prn id='Q94066'>Eileithyia</prn> with a stone statue, and near by a megaron of the <prn id='Q247617'>Curetes</prn>, where they make burnt offerings of every kind of living creature, thrusting into the flames not only <prn id='Q830'>cattle</prn> and <prn id='Q2934'>goats</prn>, but finally birds as well. There is a holy shrine of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> at <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl> and statues of the <prn id='Q190103'>Dioscuri</prn>, carrying the daughters of <prn id='Q2316900'>Leucippus</prn>. I have already explained in an earlier passage that the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> argue that the sons of <prn id='Q192946'>Tyndareus</prn> belong to them rather than to the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.31.10'><b>4.31.10</b> The most numerous statues and the most worth seeing are to be found in the <pl id='Q107162500'>hieron</pl> of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>. For besides statues of the god and his sons, and besides statues of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, the <prn id='Q66016'>Muses</prn> and <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, the city of <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> is represented and <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn> the son of <prn id='Q3395640'>Cleommis</prn>, <prn id='Q213440'>Fortune</prn>, and <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> Phosphoros (bringer of light). The stone statues are the work of <prn id='Q1158742'>Damophon</prn> (I know of no other <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> sculptor of merit apart from him); the statue of <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn> is of iron and the work of some other artist. </p>
<p id='4.31.11'><b>4.31.11</b> There is also a temple of <prn id='Q1924155'>Messene</prn> the daughter of <prn id='Q2632716'>Triopas</prn> with a statue of gold and <pl id='Q65040323'>Parian</pl> marble. At the back of the temple are paintings of the kings of <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl>: before the coming of the <prn id='Q203711'>Dorian</prn> host to <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnese</pl>, <prn id='Q578378'>Aphareus</prn> and his sons, after the return of the <prn id='Q828084'>Heracleidae</prn>, <prn id='Q1788026'>Cresphontes</prn> the <prn id='Q203711'>Dorian</prn> leader, of the inhabitants of <pl id='Q2047396'>Pylos</pl>, <prn id='Q193267'>Nestor</prn>, <prn id='Q956906'>Thrasymedes</prn> and <prn id='Q577552'>Antilochus</prn>, singled out from among the sons of <prn id='Q193267'>Nestor</prn> on the score of age and because they took part in the expedition to <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.31.12'><b>4.31.12</b> There is <prn id='Q2316900'>Leucippus</prn> brother of <prn id='Q578378'>Aphareus</prn>, <prn id='Q383960'>Hilaeira</prn> and <prn id='Q3499887'>Phoebe</prn>, and with them <prn id='Q9160370'>Arsinoe</prn>. <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> too is represented, being according to the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> account a son of <prn id='Q9160370'>Arsinoe</prn>, also <prn id='Q674319'>Machaon</prn> and <prn id='Q1071946'>Podaleirius</prn>, as they also took part in the affair at <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl>. These pictures were painted by <prn id='Q11939348'>Omphalion</prn>, pupil of <prn id='Q2583871'>Nicias</prn> the son of <prn id='Q21855594'>Nicomedes</prn>. Some say that he was also a slave in the house of <prn id='Q2583871'>Nicias</prn> and his favorite (παιδικά). </p>
<p id='4.32.1'><b>4.32.1</b> The place called Hierothesion by the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> contains statues of all the gods whom the Greeks worship, and also a bronze image of <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn>. Ancient tripods are dedicated there, which “have felt not the fire,” as <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> says. The statues in the gymnasium are the work of <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptian</pl> artists. They represent <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn>, <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> and <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>, who are honored in the gymnasium and wrestling-ground according to a practice universal among Greeks, and now common among barbarians... </p>
<p id='4.32.2'><b>4.32.2</b> I learnt by enquiry that <prn id='Q112155677'>Saithidas</prn> [ms. Aithidas] was a man older than myself, who gained influence through his wealth and is honored by the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> as a hero. There are certain <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>, who, while admitting that <prn id='Q112155677'>Saithidas</prn> was a man of great wealth, maintain that it is not he who is represented on the relief but an ancestor and namesake. The elder AethidasYY was their leader, when <prn id='Q1185467'>Demetrius</prn> the son of <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn> and his force surprised them in the night and succeeded in penetrating into the town unnoticed. </p>
<p id='4.32.3'><b>4.32.3</b> There is also the tomb of <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> here. They say that it is not a cenotaph, but when I asked whence and in what manner they recovered the bones of <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn>, they said that they sent to <pl id='Q13533316'>Rhodes</pl> for them, and that it was the god of <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> who ordered it. They also instructed me in the nature of the rites carried out at the tomb. The <prn id='Q693690'>bull</prn> which is to be offered to the dead man is brought to the tomb and bound to the pillar which stands upon the grave. Being fierce and unused to bonds he will not stand; and if the pillar is moved by his struggles and bounds, it is a good omen to the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>, but if the pillar is not moved the sign portends misfortune. </p>
<p id='4.32.4'><b>4.32.4</b> They have it that <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> was present at the battle of <pl id='Q2606004'>Leuctra</pl>, though no longer among men, and say that he helped the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> and was the chief cause of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> disaster. I know that the ChaldeanYY and <pl id='Q17055962'>Indian</pl> sages were the first to say that the soul of man is immortal, and have been followed by some of the Greeks, particularly by <prn id='Q859'>Plato</prn> the son of <prn id='Q667017'>Ariston</prn>. If all are willing to accept this, this too cannot be denied, that his hatred for the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> was imparted to <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> for all time. </p>
<p id='4.32.5'><b>4.32.5</b> What I myself heard in <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> gives probability to the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> account, although it does not coincide in all respects. The <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> say that when the battle of <pl id='Q2606004'>Leuctra</pl> was imminent, they sent to other oracles and to enquire of the god of <pl id='Q11931280'>Lebadeia</pl>. The replies of the <pl id='Q106526588'>Ismenian</pl> and <pl id='Q94522462'>Ptoan</pl> <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> are recorded, also the responses given at <pl id='Q38281622'>Abae</pl> and at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>. <prn id='Q1166183'>Trophonius</prn>, they say, answered in hexameters: “Or ever ye join battle with the foe, set up a trophy and deck it with my shield, which impetuous <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> placed in my <pl id='Q12880663'>temple</pl>. And I will destroy the host of foemen bearing shields. </p>
<p id='4.32.6'><b>4.32.6</b> When the oracle was brought, they say that <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn> urged XenocrateYY, who sent for the shield of <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> and used it to adorn a trophy in a spot where it could be seen by the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. Those of them who had seen the shield at <pl id='Q11931280'>Lebadeia</pl> in peace-time knew it, and all knew it by repute. After their victory the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> restored the offering to <prn id='Q1166183'>Trophonius</prn>. There is also a bronze statue of <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> in the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> running-ground. Not far from the theater is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q214554'>Sarapis</prn> and <prn id='Q79876'>Isis</prn>. </p>
<p id='4.33.1'><b>4.33.1</b> On the ascent to the summit of <pl id='Q602538'>Ithome</pl>, which is the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> acropolis, is a spring Clepsydra. It is a hopeless task, however zealously undertaken, to enumerate all the peoples who claim that <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> was born and brought up among them. The <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> have their share in the story for they too say that the god was brought up among them and that his nurses were <pl id='Q602538'>Ithome</pl> and <prn id='Q1984901'>Neda</prn>, the river having received its name from the latter, while the former, <pl id='Q602538'>Ithome</pl>, gave her name to the mountain. These nymphs are said to have bathed <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> here, after he was stolen by the <prn id='Q247617'>Curetes</prn> owing to the danger that threatened from his father, and it is said that it has its name from the <prn id='Q247617'>Curetes</prn>' theft. Water is carried every day from the spring to the sanctuary of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> of <pl id='Q602538'>Ithome</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.33.2'><b>4.33.2</b> The statue of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> is the work of <prn id='Q452536'>Ageladas</prn> and was made originally for the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> settlers in <pl id='Q782278'>Naupactus</pl>. The priest is chosen annually and keeps the image in his house. They keep an annual festival, the Ithomaea, and originally a musical contest was held. This can be gathered from the epic lines of <prn id='Q391254'>Eumelus</prn> and other sources. <prn id='Q391254'>Eumelus</prn>, in his processional hymn to <pl id='Q106802906'>Delos</pl>, says: “For dear to the God of <pl id='Q602538'>Ithome</pl> was the <prn id='Q66016'>Muse</prn>, whose [lute] is pure and free her sandals.” I think that he wrote the lines because he knew that they held a musical contest. </p>
<p id='4.33.3'><b>4.33.3</b> At the <pl id='Q38279515'>Arcadian gate</pl> leading to <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl> is a Herm of <pl id='Q122443'>Attic</pl> style; for the square form of Herm is <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl>, and the rest adopted it thence. After a descent of thirty stades from the gate is the watercourse of <pl id='Q25018997'>Balyra</pl>. The river is said to have got its name from <prn id='Q853014'>Thamyris</prn> throwing (ballein) his lyre away here after his blinding. He was the son of <prn id='Q53606'>Philammon</prn> and the nymph <prn id='Q3622436'>Argiope</prn>, who once dwelt on <pl id='Q105261'>Parnassus</pl>, but settled among the <pl id='Q2987531'>Odrysae</pl> when pregnant, for <prn id='Q53606'>Philammon</prn> refused to take her into his house. <prn id='Q853014'>Thamyris</prn> is called an <pl id='Q2987531'>Odrysian</pl> and Thracian on these grounds. The watercourses Leucasia and <prn id='Q122975632'>Amphitos</prn> unite to form one stream. </p>
<p id='4.33.4'><b>4.33.4</b> When these are crossed, there is a plain called the <pl id='Q15829811'>Stenycleric plain</pl>. <prn id='Q122975564'>Stenyclerus</prn> was a hero, it is said. Facing the plain is a site anciently called <pl id='Q60790408'>Oechalia</pl>, in our time the <pl id='Q28000806'>Carnasian grove</pl>, thickly grown with cypresses. There are statues of the gods <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> <prn id='Q671534'>Carneius</prn> [and Hagne], also <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> carrying a ram. Hagne (the holy one) is a title of <prn id='Q45967'>Kore</prn> the daughter of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>. Water rises from a spring close to the statue. </p>
<p id='4.33.5'><b>4.33.5</b> I may not reveal the rites of the <prn id='Q30025797'>Great Goddesses</prn>, for it is their mysteries which they celebrate in the <pl id='Q28000806'>Carnasian grove</pl>, and I regard them as second only to the <pl id='Q94299853'>Eleusinian</pl> in sanctity. But my dream did not prevent me from making known to all that the brazen urn, discovered by the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl> general, and the bones of <prn id='Q939149'>Eurytus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q1996222'>Melaneus</prn> were kept here. A river CharadrusYY flows past the grove; </p>
<p id='4.33.6'><b>4.33.6</b> about eight stades along the road to the left are the ruins of <pl id='Q2537068'>Andania</pl>. The guides agree that the city got its name from a woman <prn id='Q106698128'>Andania</prn>, but I can say nothing as to her parents or her husband. On the road from <pl id='Q2537068'>Andania</pl> towards <pl id='Q1026705'>Cyparissiae</pl> is <pl id='Q48781606'>Polichne</pl>, as it is called, and the streams of Electra and Coeus. The names perhaps are to be connected with <prn id='Q858663'>Electra</prn> the daughter of <prn id='Q130818'>Atlas</prn> and <prn id='Q182837'>Coeus</prn> the father of <prn id='Q103107'>Leto</prn>, or <prn id='Q858663'>Electra</prn> and <prn id='Q182837'>Coeus</prn> may be two local heroes. </p>
<p id='4.33.7'><b>4.33.7</b> When the Electra is crossed, there is a spring called Achaia, and the ruins of a city <pl id='Q15733318'>Dorium</pl>. <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> states that the misfortune of <prn id='Q853014'>Thamyris</prn> took place here in <pl id='Q15733318'>Dorium</pl>, because he said that he would overcome the <prn id='Q66016'>Muses</prn> themselves in song. But <prn id='Q20824286'>Prodicus</prn> of <pl id='Q428732'>Phocaea</pl>, if the epic called the <prn id='Q6871244'>Minyad</prn> is indeed his, says that <prn id='Q853014'>Thamyris</prn> paid the penalty in <pl id='Q1521549'>Hades</pl> for his boast against the <prn id='Q66016'>Muses</prn>. My view is that <prn id='Q853014'>Thamyris</prn> lost his eyesight through disease, as happened later to <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>. <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>, however, continued making poetry all his life without giving way to his misfortune, while <prn id='Q853014'>Thamyris</prn> forsook his art through stress of the trouble that afflicted him. </p>
<p id='4.34.1'><b>4.34.1</b> From <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl> to the mouth of the <pl id='Q3100663'>Pamisus</pl> is a journey of eighty stades. The <pl id='Q3100663'>Pamisus</pl> is a pure stream flowing through cultivated lands, and is navigable some ten stades from the sea. Sea-fish run up it, especially in spring, as they do up the Rhine and <pl id='Q211089'>Maeander</pl>. The chief run of fish is up the stream of the <pl id='Q203923'>Achelous</pl>, which discharges opposite the <pl id='Q767387'>Echinades</pl> islands. </p>
<p id='4.34.2'><b>4.34.2</b> But the fish that enter the <pl id='Q3100663'>Pamisus</pl> are of quite a different kind, as the water is pure and not muddy like the rivers which I have mentioned. The grey mullet, a fish that loves mud, frequents the more turbid streams. The rivers of Greece contain no creatures dangerous to men as do the <pl id='Q7348'>Indus</pl> and the <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptian</pl> <pl id='Q3392'>Nile</pl>, or again the Rhine and <pl id='Q1653'>Danube</pl>, the <pl id='Q34589'>Euphrates</pl> and <pl id='Q203409'>Phasis</pl>. These indeed produce man-eating creatures of the worst, in shape resembling the catfish of the <pl id='Q1351474'>Hermus</pl> and <pl id='Q211089'>Maeander</pl>, but of darker color and stronger. In these respects the catfish is inferior. </p>
<p id='4.34.3'><b>4.34.3</b> The <pl id='Q7348'>Indus</pl> and <pl id='Q3392'>Nile</pl> both contain crocodiles, and the <pl id='Q3392'>Nile</pl> river-horses as well, as dangerous to man as the crocodile. But the rivers of Greece contain no terrors from wild beasts, for the sharks of the <pl id='Q81503'>Aous</pl>, which flows through <pl id='Q2551754'>Thesprotia</pl>, are not river beasts but migrants from the sea. </p>
<p id='4.34.4'><b>4.34.4</b> <pl id='Q59314203'>Corone</pl> is a city to the right of the <pl id='Q3100663'>Pamisus</pl>, on the sea-coast under Mount <pl id='Q25020993'>Mathia</pl>. On this road is a place on the coast regarded as sacred to <prn id='Q223690'>Ino</prn>. For they say that she came up from the sea at this point, after her divinity had been accepted and her name changed from <prn id='Q223690'>Ino</prn> to <prn id='Q223690'>Leucothea</prn>. A short distance further the river <prn id='Q122975010'>Bias</prn> reaches the sea. The name is said to be derived from <prn id='Q855509'>Bias</prn> the son of <prn id='Q482134'>Amythaon</prn>. Twenty stades off the road is the fountain of Plataniston, the water of which flows out of a broad plane tree, which is hollow inside. The breadth of the tree gives the impression of a small cave; from it the drinking water flows to <pl id='Q59314203'>Corone</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.34.5'><b>4.34.5</b> The old name of <pl id='Q59314203'>Corone</pl> was Aepeia, but when the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> were restored to <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnese</pl> by the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl>, it is said that <prn id='Q122973331'>Epimelides</prn>, who was sent as founder, named it <pl id='Q593295'>Coroneia</pl> after his native town in <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl>. The <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> got the name wrong from the start, and the mistake which they made gradually prevailed in course of time. Another story is told to the effect that, when digging the foundations of the city wall, they came upon a bronze <prn id='Q43365'>crow</prn>, in Greek corone. </p>
<p id='4.34.6'><b>4.34.6</b> The gods who have temples here are <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, called the “Nurse of Children,” <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> and <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>. The statues of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> and <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> are of stone, but there is a statue of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> the <prn id='Q2303797'>Saviour</prn> in the agora made of bronze. The statue of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> also on the acropolis is of bronze, and stands in the open air, holding a <prn id='Q43365'>crow</prn> in her hand. I also saw the tomb of <prn id='Q122973331'>Epimelides</prn>. I do not know why they call the harbor “the harbor of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>.” </p>
<p id='4.34.7'><b>4.34.7</b> Some eighty stades beyond <pl id='Q59314203'>Corone</pl> is a <pl id='Q25164241'>sanctuary</pl> of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> on the coast, venerated because it is very ancient according to <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> tradition, and the god cures illnesses. They call him <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> Corythus. This is a <prn id='Q693222'>xoanon</prn>, but the statue of (Apollo) Argeotas, said to have been dedicated by the <prn id='Q165510'>Argonauts</prn>, is of bronze. </p>
<p id='4.34.8'><b>4.34.8</b> The city of <pl id='Q59314203'>Corone</pl> is adjoined by <pl id='Q48781603'>Colonides</pl>. The inhabitants say that they are not <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> but settlers from <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl> brought by <prn id='Q3682580'>Colaenus</prn>, who followed a bird known as the crested lark to found the settlement in accordance with an oracle. They were, however, in the course of time to adopt the dialect and customs of the <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn>. The town of <pl id='Q48781603'>Colonides</pl> lies on high ground, a short distance from the sea. </p>
<p id='4.34.9'><b>4.34.9</b> The people of <pl id='Q16488997'>Asine</pl> originally adjoined the <pl id='Q5975192'>Lycoritae</pl> on <pl id='Q105261'>Parnassus</pl>. Their name, which they maintained after their arrival in <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnese</pl>, was <pl id='Q11917781'>Dryopes</pl>, from their founder. Two generations after <prn id='Q3040215'>Dryops</prn>, in the reign of <prn id='Q3744925'>Phylas</prn>, the <pl id='Q11917781'>Dryopes</pl> were conquered in battle by <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> and brought as an offering to <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>. When brought to <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnese</pl> according to the god's instructions to <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, they first occupied <pl id='Q1154474'>Asine</pl> by <pl id='Q58401924'>Hermion</pl>. They were driven thence by the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> and lived in <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl>. This was the gift of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, and when in the course of time the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> were restored, they were not driven from their city by the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.34.10'><b>4.34.10</b> But the people of <pl id='Q16488997'>Asine</pl> give this account of themselves. They admit that they were conquered by <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> and their city in <pl id='Q105261'>Parnassus</pl> captured, but they deny that they were made prisoners and brought to <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>. But when the walls were carried by <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, they deserted the town and fled to the heights of <pl id='Q105261'>Parnassus</pl>, and afterwards crossed the sea to <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnese</pl> and appealed to <prn id='Q212087'>Eurystheus</prn>. Being at feud with <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, he gave them <pl id='Q1154474'>Asine</pl> in the <pl id='Q12649101'>Argolid</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.34.11'><b>4.34.11</b> The men of <pl id='Q16488997'>Asine</pl> are the only members of the race of the <pl id='Q11917781'>Dryopes</pl> to pride themselves on the name to this day. The case is very different with the <pl id='Q173096'>Euboeans</pl> of <pl id='Q57758204'>Styra</pl>. They too are <pl id='Q11917781'>Dryopes</pl> in origin, who took no part in the battle with <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, as they dwelt at some distance from the city. Yet the people of <pl id='Q57758204'>Styra</pl> disdain the name of <pl id='Q11917781'>Dryopes</pl>, just as the <pl id='Q75459'>Delphians</pl> have refused to be called <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl>. But the men of <pl id='Q16488997'>Asine</pl> take the greatest pleasure in being called <pl id='Q11917781'>Dryopes</pl>, and clearly have made the most holy of their sanctuaries in memory of those which they once had established on <pl id='Q105261'>Parnassus</pl>. For they have both a temple of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> and again a sanctuary and ancient statue of <prn id='Q3040215'>Dryops</prn>, whose mysteries they celebrate every year, saying that he is the son of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>. </p>
<p id='4.34.12'><b>4.34.12</b> The town itself lies on the coast just as the old <pl id='Q16488997'>Asine</pl> in <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl> territory. It is a journey of forty stades from <pl id='Q48781603'>Colonides</pl> to <pl id='Q16488997'>Asine</pl>, and of an equal number from <pl id='Q16488997'>Asine</pl> to the promontory called <pl id='Q21008093'>Acritas</pl>. <pl id='Q21008093'>Acritas</pl> projects into the sea and has a deserted island, <pl id='Q2512852'>Theganussa</pl>, lying off it. After <pl id='Q21008093'>Acritas</pl> is the harbor <pl id='Q48781608'>Phoenicus</pl> and the <pl id='Q1664313'>Oenussae</pl> islands lying opposite. </p>
<p id='4.35.1'><b>4.35.1</b> Before the mustering of the army for the <prn id='Q42937'>Trojan War</prn>, and during the war, <pl id='Q60790706'>Mothone</pl> was called <pl id='Q16623530'>Pedasus</pl>. Later, as the people themselves say, it received a new name from the daughter of <prn id='Q749966'>Oeneus</prn>. They say that <prn id='Q20101247'>Mothone</prn> was born of a concubine to <prn id='Q749966'>Oeneus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q1178970'>Porthaon</prn>, when he had taken refuge with <prn id='Q208256'>Diomede</prn> in <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnese</pl> after the fall of <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl>. But in my view it was the rock Mothon that gave the place its name. It is this which forms their harbor. For projecting under water, it makes the entrance for ships more narrow and also serves as a breakwater against a heavy swell. </p>
<p id='4.35.2'><b>4.35.2</b> I have shown in earlier passages that, when the <pl id='Q56399740'>Nauplians</pl> in the reign of <prn id='Q122973451'>Damocratidas</prn> in <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> were expelled for their <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconian</pl> sympathies, the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> gave them <pl id='Q60790706'>Mothone</pl>, and that no change was made regarding them on the part of the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> when they returned. The <pl id='Q56399740'>Nauplians</pl> in my view were <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptians</pl> originally, who came by sea with <prn id='Q210883'>Danaus</prn> to the <pl id='Q12649101'>Argolid</pl>, and two generations later were settled in <pl id='Q56399740'>Nauplia</pl> by <prn id='Q833826'>Nauplius</prn> the son of <prn id='Q482096'>Amymone</prn>. </p>
<p id='4.35.3'><b>4.35.3</b> The Emperor <prn id='Q1425'>Trajan</prn> granted civic freedom and autonomy to the people of <pl id='Q60790706'>Mothone</pl>. In earlier days they were the only people of <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl> on the coast to suffer a disaster like the following: <pl id='Q2551754'>Thesprotian</pl> <pl id='Q565751'>Epirus</pl> was ruined by anarchy. For <prn id='Q2993209'>Deidameia</prn> the daughter of <prn id='Q94848'>Pyrrhus</prn>, being without children, handed over the government to the people when she was on the point of death. She was the daughter of <prn id='Q94848'>Pyrrhus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q3563389'>Ptolemy</prn>, son of <prn id='Q124346'>Alexander</prn>, son of <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn>. </p>
<p id='4.35.4'><b>4.35.4</b> I have told the facts relating to <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q403377'>Aeacides</prn> in my account of the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>. <prn id='Q106780297'>Procles</prn> the Carthaginian indeed rated <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn> the son of <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn> higher on account of his good fortune and for the brilliance of his achievements, but said that <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn> was the better man in infantry and cavalry tactics and in the invention of stratagems of war. </p>
<p id='4.35.5'><b>4.35.5</b> When the <pl id='Q565751'>Epirots</pl> were rid of their kings, the people threw off all control and disdained to listen to their magistrates, and the <pl id='Q32047'>Illyrians</pl> who live on the <pl id='Q37495'>Ionian Sea</pl> above <pl id='Q565751'>Epirus</pl> reduced them by a raid. We have yet to hear of a democracy bringing prosperity to a nation other than the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>; the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> attained to greatness by its means, for they surpassed the Greek world in native wit, and least disregarded the established laws. </p>
<p id='4.35.6'><b>4.35.6</b> Now the <pl id='Q32047'>Illyrians</pl>, having tasted empire and being always desirous of more, built ships, and plundering others whom they fell in with, put in to the coast of <pl id='Q60790706'>Mothone</pl> and anchored as in a friendly port. Sending a messenger to the city they asked for wine to be brought to their ships. A few men came with it and they bought the wine at the price which the inhabitants asked, and themselves sold a part of their cargo. </p>
<p id='4.35.7'><b>4.35.7</b> When on the following day a larger number arrived from the town, they allowed them also to make their profit. Finally women and men came down to the ships to sell wine and trade with the barbarians. Thereupon by a bold stroke the <pl id='Q32047'>Illyrians</pl> carried off a number of men and still more of the women. Carrying them on board ship, they set sail for the <pl id='Q37495'>Ionian Sea</pl>, having desolated the city of the <pl id='Q60790706'>Mothonaeans</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.35.8'><b>4.35.8</b> In <pl id='Q60790706'>Mothone</pl> is a temple of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> <prn id='Q21548642'>Anemotis</prn> (Of the Winds), with a statue dedicated, it is said, by <prn id='Q208256'>Diomedes</prn>, who gave the goddess her name. The country being damaged by violent and unseasonable blasts, <prn id='Q208256'>Diomedes</prn> prayed to the goddess, and henceforward no disaster caused by the winds has visited their country. There is also a shrine of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> here and water in a well mixed with pitch, in appearance very like the iris-oil of <pl id='Q615449'>Cyzicos</pl>. Water can assume every color and scent. </p>
<p id='4.35.9'><b>4.35.9</b> The bluest that I know from personal experience is that at <pl id='Q194450'>Thermopylae</pl>, not all of it, but that which flows into the swimming-baths, called locally the Women's Pots (Chytroi). Red water, in color like blood, is found in the land of the <prn id='Q7325'>Hebrews</prn> near the city of <pl id='Q11713655'>Joppa</pl>. The water is close to the sea, and the account which the natives give of the spring is that <prn id='Q130832'>Perseus</prn>, after destroying the sea-monster, to which the daughter of <prn id='Q858116'>Cepheus</prn> was exposed, washed off the blood in the spring. </p>
<p id='4.35.10'><b>4.35.10</b> I have myself seen water coming up black from springs at <pl id='Q65070884'>Astyra</pl>. <pl id='Q65070884'>Astyra</pl> opposite <pl id='Q128087'>Lesbos</pl> is the name of the hot baths in the district called <pl id='Q194810'>Atarneus</pl>. It was this <pl id='Q194810'>Atarneus</pl>, which the <pl id='Q748832'>Chians</pl> received as a reward from the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl> as a reward for surrendering the suppliant, <prn id='Q11939740'>Pactyas</prn> the <pl id='Q620765'>Lydian</pl>. This water then has a black color; but the Romans have a white water, above the city across the river called <pl id='Q546600'>Anio</pl>. When a man enters it, he is at first attacked with cold and shivering, but after a little time it warms him like the hottest drug. </p>
<p id='4.35.11'><b>4.35.11</b> All these springs that had something wonderful to show I have seen myself. For I pass over the less wonderful that I know, and it is no great marvel to find water that is salt and harsh. But there are two other kinds. The water in the White Plain, as it is called, in <pl id='Q193214'>Caria</pl>, by the village with the name Dascylou Kome, is warm and sweeter than milk to drink. I know that <prn id='Q26825'>Herodotus</prn> says that a spring of bitter water flows into the river <pl id='Q188940'>Hypanis</pl>. We can assuredly admit the truth of his statement, when in our days at <pl id='Q72425'>Dicaearchia</pl> (Puteoli), in the land of the <pl id='Q206730'>Tyrrhenians</pl>, a hot spring has been found, so acid that in a few years it dissolved the lead through which its water passed. </p>
<p id='4.36.1'><b>4.36.1</b> It is a journey of about a hundred stades from <pl id='Q60790706'>Mothone</pl> to the promontory of <pl id='Q25024356'>Coryphasium</pl>, on which Pylos lies. This was founded by <prn id='Q3411223'>Pylos</prn> the son of <prn id='Q2980787'>Cleson</prn>, bringing from the <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarid</pl> the <pl id='Q375221'>Leleges</pl> who then occupied the country. But he did not enjoy it, as he was driven out by <prn id='Q637955'>Neleus</prn> and the <pl id='Q14472556'>Pelasgians</pl> of <pl id='Q662613'>Iolcos</pl>, on which he departed to the adjoining country and there occupied the <pl id='Q7263101'>Pylos</pl> in <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>. When <prn id='Q637955'>Neleus</prn> became king, he raised <pl id='Q2047396'>Pylos</pl> to such renown that <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> in his epics calls it the city of <prn id='Q637955'>Neleus</prn>. </p>
<p id='4.36.2'><b>4.36.2</b> It contains a sanctuary of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> with the title <prn id='Q58818192'>Coryphasia</prn>, and a house called the house of <prn id='Q193267'>Nestor</prn>, in which there is a painting of him. His tomb is inside the city; the tomb at a little distance from Pylos is said to be the tomb of <prn id='Q956906'>Thrasymedes</prn>. There is a <pl id='Q25162361'>cave</pl> inside the town, in which it is said that the <prn id='Q830'>cattle</prn> belonging to <prn id='Q193267'>Nestor</prn> and to <prn id='Q637955'>Neleus</prn> before him were kept. </p>
<p id='4.36.3'><b>4.36.3</b> These <prn id='Q830'>cattle</prn> must have been of <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessalian</pl> stock, having once belonged to <prn id='Q1525379'>Iphiclus</prn> the father of <prn id='Q871361'>Protesilaus</prn>. <prn id='Q637955'>Neleus</prn> demanded these <prn id='Q830'>cattle</prn> as bride gifts for his daughter from her suitors, and it was on their account that <prn id='Q602258'>Melampus</prn> went to <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessaly</pl> to gratify his brother <prn id='Q855509'>Bias</prn>. He was put in bonds by the herdsmen of <prn id='Q1525379'>Iphiclus</prn>, but received them as his reward for the prophecies which he gave to <prn id='Q1525379'>Iphiclus</prn> at his request. So it seems the men of those days made it their business to amass wealth of this kind, herds of <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn> and <prn id='Q830'>cattle</prn>, if it is the case that <prn id='Q193267'>Nestor</prn> desired to get possession of the <prn id='Q830'>cattle</prn> of <prn id='Q1525379'>Iphiclus</prn> and that <prn id='Q212087'>Eurystheus</prn>, in view of the reputation of the <pl id='Q1203967'>Iberian</pl> <prn id='Q830'>cattle</prn>, ordered <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> to drive off the herd of <prn id='Q86805'>Geryones</prn>. </p>
<p id='4.36.4'><b>4.36.4</b> <prn id='Q430157'>Eryx</prn> too, who was reigning then in <pl id='Q4951156'>Sicily</pl>, plainly had so violent a desire for the <prn id='Q830'>cattle</prn> from <pl id='Q5890310'>Erytheia</pl> that he wrestled with <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, staking his kingdom on the match against these <prn id='Q830'>cattle</prn>. As <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> says in the <prn id='Q8275'>Iliad</prn>, a hundred <prn id='Q830'>kine</prn> were the first of the bride gifts paid by <prn id='Q2497780'>Iphidamas</prn> the son of <prn id='Q571969'>Antenor</prn> to his bride's father. This confirms my argument that the men of those days took the greatest pleasure in <prn id='Q830'>cattle</prn>. </p>
<p id='4.36.5'><b>4.36.5</b> But the <prn id='Q830'>cattle</prn> of <prn id='Q637955'>Neleus</prn> were pastured for the most part across the border, I think. For the country of the <pl id='Q2047396'>Pylians</pl> in general is sandy and unable to provide so much grazing. <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> testifies to this, when he mentions <prn id='Q193267'>Nestor</prn>, always adding that he was king of sandy <pl id='Q2047396'>Pylos</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.36.6'><b>4.36.6</b> The island of <pl id='Q1303524'>Sphacteria</pl> lies in front of the harbor just as <pl id='Q1475379'>Rheneia</pl> off the anchorage at <pl id='Q173148'>Delos</pl>. It seems that places hitherto unknown have been raised to fame by the fortunes of men. For <pl id='Q1982478'>Caphereus</pl> in <pl id='Q173096'>Euboea</pl> is famous since the storm that here befell the Greeks with <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn> on their voyage from <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl>. <pl id='Q2031588'>Psyttaleia</pl> by <pl id='Q202422'>Salamis</pl> we know from the destruction of the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl> there. In like manner the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> reverse made <pl id='Q1303524'>Sphacteria</pl> known to all mankind. The <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> dedicated a bronze statue of <prn id='Q165023'>Victory</prn> also on the <pl id='Q131013'>Acropolis</pl> as a memorial of the events at <pl id='Q1303524'>Sphacteria</pl>. </p>
<p id='4.36.7'><b>4.36.7</b> When <pl id='Q1026705'>Cyparissiae</pl> is reached from Pylos, there is a spring below the city near the sea, the water of which they say gushed forth for <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> when he struck he ground with a thyrsus. For this reason they call the spring DionysiasYY. There is a shrine of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> in <pl id='Q1026705'>Cyparissiae</pl> and of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> with the title <pl id='Q1026705'>Cyparissia</pl>. In the depression called <pl id='Q11907271'>Aulon</pl> there is a temple and statue of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> Aulonius. Here flows the river <pl id='Q1641987'>Neda</pl>, forming the boundary between <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl> and <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>. </p>
<p id='5.1.1'><b>5.1.1</b> BOOK 5 <br>The Greeks who say that the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl> has five, and only five, divisions must agree that <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl> contains both <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> and <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>, that the second division belongs to the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, and the remaining three to the <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn>. Of the races dwelling in <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl> the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> and <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> are aborigines. When the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> were driven from their land by the <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn>, they did not retire from <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl>, but they cast out the <pl id='Q620874'>Ionians</pl> and occupied the land called of old <pl id='Q2790451'>Aegialus</pl>, but now called <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaea</pl> from these <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>. The <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl>, on the other hand, have from the beginning to to the present time continued in possession of their own country. </p>
<p id='5.1.2'><b>5.1.2</b> The rest of <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl> belongs to immigrants.

The <pl id='Q11917781'>Dryopians</pl> reached the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl> from <pl id='Q105261'>Parnassus</pl>, the <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn> from <pl id='Q132378'>Oeta</pl>. </p>
<p id='5.1.3'><b>5.1.3</b> The <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> we know crossed over from <pl id='Q750313'>Calydon</pl> and <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolia</pl> generally.

<p id='5.1.8'><b>5.1.8</b> <prn id='Q410748'>Aetolus</prn>, who came to the throne after <prn id='Q687206'>Epeius</prn>, was made to flee from <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl>, because the children of <prn id='Q14590069'>Apis</prn> tried and convicted him of unintentional homicide.

<p id='5.1.9'><b>5.1.9</b> <prn id='Q12877646'>Eleius</prn> had a son <prn id='Q207663'>Augeas</prn>.

This <prn id='Q207663'>Augeas</prn> had so many <prn id='Q830'>cattle</prn> and flocks of <prn id='Q2934'>goats</prn> that actually most of his land remained untilled because of the dung of the animals. Now he persuaded <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> to cleanse for him the land from dung, either in return for a part of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> or possibly for some other reward. </p>
<p id='5.1.10'><b>5.1.10</b> <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> accomplished this feat too, turning aside the stream of the <prn id='Q107477417'>Menius</prn> into the dung. But, because <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> had accomplished his task by cunning, without toil, <prn id='Q207663'>Augeas</prn> refused to give him his reward, and banished <prn id='Q1779164'>Phyleus</prn>, the elder of his two sons, for objecting that he was wronging a man who had been his benefactor. He made preparations himself to resist <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, should he attack <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>; more particularly he made friends with the sons of <prn id='Q423424'>Actor</prn> and with <prn id='Q2466253'>Amarynceus</prn>. <prn id='Q2466253'>Amarynceus</prn>, besides being a good soldier, </p>
<p id='5.1.11'><b>5.1.11</b> had a father, <prn id='Q122981030'>Pyttius</prn>, of <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessalian</pl> descent, who came from <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessaly</pl> to <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>. To <prn id='Q2466253'>Amarynceus</prn>, therefore, <prn id='Q207663'>Augeas</prn> also gave a share in the government of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>; <prn id='Q423424'>Actor</prn> and his sons had a share in the kingdom and were natives of the country. For the father of <prn id='Q423424'>Actor</prn> was <prn id='Q22965548'>Phorbas</prn>, son of <prn id='Q1805777'>Lapithus</prn>, and his mother was <prn id='Q1641568'>Hyrmina</prn>, daughter of <prn id='Q687206'>Epeius</prn>. <prn id='Q423424'>Actor</prn> named after her the city of <pl id='Q535238'>Hyrmina</pl>, which he founded in <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>. </p>
<p id='5.2.1'><b>5.2.1</b> <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> accomplished no brilliant feat in the war with <prn id='Q207663'>Augeas</prn>. For the sons of <prn id='Q423424'>Actor</prn> were in the prime of courageous manhood, and always put to flight the allies under <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, until the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthians</pl> proclaimed the <pl id='Q16600469'>Isthmian</pl> truce, and the sons of <prn id='Q423424'>Actor</prn> came as envoys to the meeting. <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> set an ambush for then, at <pl id='Q1774167'>Cleonae</pl> and murdered them. As the murderer was unknown, <prn id='Q4300425'>Moline</prn>, more than any of the other children, devoted herself to detecting him. </p>
<p id='5.2.2'><b>5.2.2</b> When she discovered him, the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> demanded satisfaction for the crime from the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>, for at the time <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> had his home at <pl id='Q217379'>Tiryns</pl>. When the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> refused them satisfaction, the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> as an alternative pressed the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthians</pl> entirely to exclude the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl> people from the <prn id='Q675181'>Isthmian games</prn>. When they failed in this also, <prn id='Q4300425'>Moline</prn> is said to have laid curses on her countrymen, should they refuse to boycott the <pl id='Q16600469'>Isthmian</pl> festival. The curses of <prn id='Q4300425'>Moline</prn> are respected right down to the present day, and no athlete of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> is wont to compete in the <prn id='Q675181'>Isthmian games</prn>. </p>
<p id='5.2.3'><b>5.2.3</b> There are two other accounts, differing from the one that I have given. According to one of them <prn id='Q430688'>Cypselus</prn>, the tyrant of <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl>, dedicated to <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> a golden image at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>. As <prn id='Q430688'>Cypselus</prn> died before inscribing his own name on the offering, the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthians</pl> asked of the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> leave to inscribe the name of <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl> on it, but were refused. Wroth with the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>, they proclaimed that they must keep away from the <prn id='Q675181'>Isthmian games</prn>. But how could the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthians</pl> themselves take part in the <prn id='Q188468'>Olympic games</prn> if the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> against their will were shut out by the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthians</pl> from the <prn id='Q675181'>Isthmian games</prn>? </p>
<p id='5.2.4'><b>5.2.4</b> The other account is this. <prn id='Q122981323'>Prolaus</prn>, a distinguished <pl id='Q6536845'>Elean</pl>, had two sons, <prn id='Q12885689'>Philanthus</prn> and A1257, by his wife <prn id='Q122981279'>Lysippe</prn>. These two came to the <prn id='Q675181'>Isthmian games</prn> to compete in the boys' pancratium, and one of them intended to wrestle. Before they entered the ring they were strangled or done to death in some other way by their fellow competitors. Hence the curses of <prn id='Q122981279'>Lysippe</prn> on the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>, should they not voluntarily keep away from the <prn id='Q675181'>Isthmian games</prn>. But this story too proves on examination to be silly. </p>
<p id='5.2.5'><b>5.2.5</b> For <prn id='Q20493498'>Timon</prn>, a man of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>, won victories in the pentathlum at the Greek games, and at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> there is even a statue of him, with an elegiac inscription giving the crowns he won and also the reason why he secured no <pl id='Q16600469'>Isthmian</pl> victory. The inscription sets forth the reason thus: <br>“But from going to the land of <prn id='Q102561'>Sisyphus</prn> he was hindered by a quarrel <br>About the baleful death of the <prn id='Q958315'>Molionids</prn>. </p>
<p id='5.3.1'><b>5.3.1</b> Enough of my discussion of this question. <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> afterwards took <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> and sacked it, with an army he had raised of <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>, <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> and <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl>. The <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> were aided by the men of <pl id='Q922329'>Pisa</pl> and of <pl id='Q7263101'>Pylus</pl> in <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>. The men of <pl id='Q7263101'>Pylus</pl> were punished by <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, but his expedition against <pl id='Q922329'>Pisa</pl> was stopped by an oracle from <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> to this effect “My father cares for <pl id='Q922329'>Pisa</pl>, but to me in the hollows of <pl id='Q682558'>Pytho</pl>.” This oracle proved the salvation of <pl id='Q922329'>Pisa</pl>. To <prn id='Q1779164'>Phyleus</prn> <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> gave up the land of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> and all the rest, more out of respect for <prn id='Q1779164'>Phyleus</prn> than because he wanted to do so: he allowed him to keep the prisoners, and <prn id='Q207663'>Augeas</prn> to escape punishment. </p>
<p id='5.3.2'><b>5.3.2</b> The women of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>, it is said, seeing that their land had been deprived of its vigorous manhood, prayed to <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> that they might conceive at their first union with their husbands. Their prayer was answered, and they set up a sanctuary of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> surnamed <prn id='Q111668056'>Mother</prn>. Both wives and husbands were so delighted at their union that they named the place itself, where they first met, Bady (sweet), and the river that runs thereby Bady Water, this being a word of their native dialect. </p>
<p id='5.3.3'><b>5.3.3</b> When <prn id='Q1779164'>Phyleus</prn> had returned to <pl id='Q3038108'>Dulichium</pl> after organizing the affairs of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>, <prn id='Q207663'>Augeas</prn> died at an advanced age, and the kingdom of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> devolved on <prn id='Q2723619'>Agasthenes</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q207663'>Augeas</prn>, and on <prn id='Q5676461'>Amphimachus</prn> and <prn id='Q1995961'>Thalpius</prn>. For the sons of <prn id='Q423424'>Actor</prn> married twin sisters, the daughters of <prn id='Q3706015'>Dexamenus</prn> who was king at <pl id='Q11939304'>Olenus</pl>; <prn id='Q5676461'>Amphimachus</prn> was born to one <prn id='Q3699000'>son</prn> and <prn id='Q14690266'>Theronice</prn>, <prn id='Q1995961'>Thalpius</prn> to her sister <prn id='Q14702573'>Theraephone</prn> and <prn id='Q10715158'>Eurytus</prn>. </p>
<p id='5.3.4'><b>5.3.4</b> However, neither <prn id='Q2466253'>Amarynceus</prn> himself nor his son <prn id='Q22965421'>Diores</prn> remained common people. Incidentally this is shown by <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> in his list of the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>; he makes their whole fleet to consist of forty ships, half of them under the command of <prn id='Q5676461'>Amphimachus</prn> and <prn id='Q1995961'>Thalpius</prn>, and of the remaining twenty he puts ten under <prn id='Q22965421'>Diores</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q2466253'>Amarynceus</prn>, and ten under <prn id='Q3907401'>Polyxenus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q2723619'>Agasthenes</prn>. <prn id='Q3907401'>Polyxenus</prn> came back safe from <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl> and begat a son, <prn id='Q5676469'>Amphimachus</prn>. This name I think <prn id='Q3907401'>Polyxenus</prn> gave his son because of his friendship with <prn id='Q5676461'>Amphimachus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q3699000'>Cteatus</prn>, who died at <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl>. </p>
<p id='5.3.5'><b>5.3.5</b> <prn id='Q5676469'>Amphimachus</prn> begat <prn id='Q14702593'>Eleius</prn>, and it was while <prn id='Q14702593'>Eleius</prn> was king in <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> that the assembly of the <prn id='Q203711'>Dorian</prn> army under the sons of <prn id='Q311536'>Aristomachus</prn> took place, with a view to returning to the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl>. To their kings was delivered this oracle, that they were to choose the “one with three eyes” to lead them on their return. When they were at a loss as to the meaning of the oracle, they were met by a man driving a mule, which was blind of one eye. </p>
<p id='5.3.6'><b>5.3.6</b> <prn id='Q1788026'>Cresphontes</prn> inferred that this was the man indicated by the oracle, and so the <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn> made him one of themselves. He urged them to descend upon the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl> in ships, and not to attempt to go across the <pl id='Q215200'>Isthmus</pl> with a land army. Such was his advice, and at the same time he led them on the voyage from <pl id='Q782278'>Naupactus</pl> to <pl id='Q56401707'>Molycrium</pl>. In return they agreed to give him at his request the land of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>. The man was <prn id='Q575252'>Oxylus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q14565968'>Haemon</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q1367871'>Thoas</prn>. This was the <prn id='Q1367871'>Thoas</prn> who helped the sons of <prn id='Q192469'>Atreus</prn> to destroy the empire of <prn id='Q170473'>Priam</prn>, and from <prn id='Q1367871'>Thoas</prn> to <prn id='Q410748'>Aetolus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q272047'>Endymion</prn> are six generations. </p>
<p id='5.3.7'><b>5.3.7</b> There were ties of kindred between the <prn id='Q828084'>Heracleidae</prn> and the kings of <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolia</pl>; in particular the mothers of <prn id='Q1367871'>Thoas</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q16335866'>Andraemon</prn>, and of <prn id='Q847268'>Hyllus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, were sisters. It fell to the lot of <prn id='Q575252'>Oxylus</prn> to be an outlaw from <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolia</pl>. The story goes that as he was throwing the quoit he missed the mark and committed unintentional homicide. The man killed by the quoit, according to one account, was <prn id='Q16327406'>Thermius</prn>, the brother of <prn id='Q575252'>Oxylus</prn>; according to another it was Alcidocus, the son of Scopius. </p>
<p id='5.4.1'><b>5.4.1</b> The following story is also told of <prn id='Q575252'>Oxylus</prn>. He suspected that, when the sons of <prn id='Q311536'>Aristomachus</prn> saw that the land of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> was a goodly one, and cultivated throughout, they would be no longer willing to give it to him. He accordingly led the <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn> through <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl> and not through <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>. <prn id='Q575252'>Oxylus</prn> was anxious to get the kingdom of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> without a battle, but <prn id='Q106841902'>Dius</prn> would not give way; he proposed that, instead of their fighting a pitched battle with all their forces, a single soldier should be chosen from each army to fight as its champion. </p>
<p id='5.4.2'><b>5.4.2</b> This proposal chanced to find favour with both sides, and the champions chosen were the <pl id='Q6536845'>Elean</pl> <prn id='Q30023815'>Degmenus</prn>, an archer, and <prn id='Q21714483'>Pyraechmes</prn>, a slinger, to represent the <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolians</pl>. <prn id='Q21714483'>Pyraechmes</prn> won and <prn id='Q575252'>Oxylus</prn> got the kingdom. He allowed the old inhabitants, the <pl id='Q12872855'>Epeans</pl>, to keep their possessions, except that he introduced among them <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolian</pl> colonists, giving them a share in the land. He assigned privileges to <prn id='Q106841902'>Dius</prn>, and kept up after the ancient manner the honors paid to heroes, especially the worship of <prn id='Q207663'>Augeas</prn>, to whom even at the present day hero-sacrifice is offered. </p>
<p id='5.4.3'><b>5.4.3</b> He is also said to have induced to come into the city the dwellers in the villages near the wall, and by increasing the number of the inhabitants to have made <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> larger and generally more prosperous. There also came to him an oracle from <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>, that he should bring in as co-founder “the descendant of <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn>.” <prn id='Q575252'>Oxylus</prn> made diligent search, and in his search he discovered <prn id='Q12873026'>Agorius</prn>, son of <prn id='Q1158255'>Damasius</prn>, son of <prn id='Q1336476'>Penthilus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q192407'>Orestes</prn>. He brought <prn id='Q12873026'>Agorius</prn> himself from <pl id='Q1432654'>Helice</pl> in <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaia</pl>, and with him a small body of <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>. </p>
<p id='5.4.4'><b>5.4.4</b> The wife of <prn id='Q575252'>Oxylus</prn> they say was called <prn id='Q3903040'>Pieria</prn>, but beyond this nothing more about her is recorded. <prn id='Q575252'>Oxylus</prn> is said to have had two sons, <prn id='Q14702443'>Aetolus</prn> and <prn id='Q12880070'>Laias</prn>. <prn id='Q14702443'>Aetolus</prn> died before his parents, who buried him in a tomb which they caused to be made right in the gate leading to <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> and the sanctuary of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>. That they buried him thus was due to an oracle forbidding the corpse to be laid either without the city or within it. Right down to our own day the gymnasiarch sacrifices to <prn id='Q14702443'>Aetolus</prn> as to a hero every year. </p>
<p id='5.4.5'><b>5.4.5</b> After <prn id='Q575252'>Oxylus</prn> the kingdom devolved on <prn id='Q12880070'>Laias</prn>, son of <prn id='Q575252'>Oxylus</prn>. His descendants, however, I find did not reign, and so I pass them by, though I know who they were; my narrative must not descend to men of common rank. Later on <prn id='Q2298655'>Iphitus</prn>, of the line of <prn id='Q575252'>Oxylus</prn> and contemporary with <prn id='Q211326'>Lycurgus</prn>, who drew up the code of laws for the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, arranged the games at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> and reestablished afresh the <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> festival and truce, after an interruption of uncertain length. The reason for this interruption I will set forth when my narrative deals with <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>. </p>
<p id='5.4.6'><b>5.4.6</b> At this time Greece was grievously worn by internal strife and plague, and it occurred to <prn id='Q2298655'>Iphitus</prn> to ask the god at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> for deliverance from these evils. The story goes that the <prn id='Q220344'>Pythian priestess</prn> ordained that <prn id='Q2298655'>Iphitus</prn> himself and the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> must renew the <prn id='Q188468'>Olympic games</prn>. <prn id='Q2298655'>Iphitus</prn> also induced the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> to sacrifice to <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> as to a god, whom hitherto they had looked upon as their enemy. The inscription at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> calls <prn id='Q2298655'>Iphitus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q14565968'>Haemon</prn>, but most of the Greeks say that his father was Praxonides and not <prn id='Q14565968'>Haemon</prn>, while the ancient records of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> traced him to a father of the same name. </p>
<p id='5.4.7'><b>5.4.7</b> The <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> played their part in the <prn id='Q42937'>Trojan War</prn>, and also in the battles of the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl> invasion of Greece. I pass over their struggles with the <pl id='Q922329'>Pisans</pl> and <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> for the management of the <pl id='Q38888'>Olympian</pl> games. Against their will they joined the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> in their invasion of <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> territory, and shortly afterwards they rose up with the <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineans</pl> and <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> against the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, inducing <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> too to join the alliance. </p>
<p id='5.4.8'><b>5.4.8</b> When <prn id='Q202826'>Agis</prn> invaded the land, and <prn id='Q8043496'>Xenias</prn> turned traitor, the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> won a battle near <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>, routed the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> and drove them out of the sacred enclosure; but shortly afterwards the war was concluded by the treaty I have already spoken of in my account of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. 9 </p>
<p id='5.4.9'><b>5.4.9</b> When <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn> the son of <prn id='Q313907'>Amyntas</prn> would not let Greece alone, the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>, weakened by civil strife, joined the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonian</pl> alliance, but they could not bring themselves to fight against the Greeks at <pl id='Q13574678'>Chaeroneia</pl>. They joined <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn>'s attack on the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> because of their old hatred of that people, but on the death of <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn> they fought on the side of the Greeks against <prn id='Q204760'>Antipater</prn> and the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl>. </p>
<p id='5.5.1'><b>5.5.1</b> Later on <prn id='Q19600230'>Aristotimus</prn>, the son of DamaretusYY, the son of Etymon, became despot of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>, being aided in his attempt by <prn id='Q241386'>Antigonus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q59734'>Demetrius</prn>, who was king in <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl>. After a despotism of six months <prn id='Q19600230'>Aristotimus</prn> was deposed, a rising against him having been organized by Chilon, HellanicuYY, LampisYY and <prn id='Q106132734'>Cylon</prn>; <prn id='Q106132734'>Cylon</prn> it was who with his own hand killed the despot when he had sought sanctuary at the altar of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> the <prn id='Q2303797'>Saviour</prn>. Such were the wars of the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>, of which my present enumeration must serve as a summary. </p>
<p id='5.5.2'><b>5.5.2</b> The land of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> contains two marvels. Here, and here only in Greece, does fine flax grow; and secondly, only over the border, and not within it, can the mares be impregnated by <prn id='Q19707'>asses</prn>. The cause of this is said to have been a curse. The fine flax of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> is as fine as that of the <prn id='Q7325'>Hebrews</prn>, but it is not so yellow. </p>
<p id='5.5.3'><b>5.5.3</b> As you go from <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> there is a district stretching down to the sea. It is called <pl id='Q3558588'>Samicum</pl>, and above it on the right is what is called <pl id='Q472032'>Triphylia</pl>, in which is the city <pl id='Q5860679'>Lepreus</pl>. The citizens of this city wish to belong to the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl>, but it is plain that from the beginning they have been subject to the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>. Such of them as have won <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> victories have been announced by the herald as <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> from <pl id='Q5860679'>Lepreus</pl>, and <prn id='Q43353'>Aristophanes</prn> in a comedy calls <pl id='Q5860679'>Lepreus</pl> a town of the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>. Leaving the river <pl id='Q3791516'>Anigrus</pl> on the left there is a road leading to <pl id='Q5860679'>Lepreus</pl>; from <pl id='Q3558588'>Samicum</pl> another leads to it from <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> and a third from <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>. The longest of them is a day's journey. </p>
<p id='5.5.4'><b>5.5.4</b> The city got its name, they say, from its founder <prn id='Q4259170'>Lepreus</prn> the son of Pyrgeus. There was also a story that <prn id='Q4259170'>Lepreus</prn> contended with <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>: that he was as good a trencherman. Each killed an <prn id='Q473194'>ox</prn> at the same time and prepared it for the table. It turned out, even as <prn id='Q4259170'>Lepreus</prn> maintained, that he was as powerful a trencherman as <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>. Afterwards he made bold to challenge him to a duel. <prn id='Q4259170'>Lepreus</prn>, they say, lost, was killed, and was buried in the land of <pl id='Q7623270'>Phigaleia</pl>. The <pl id='Q7623270'>Phigalians</pl>, however, could not show a tomb of <prn id='Q4259170'>Lepreus</prn>. </p>
<p id='5.5.5'><b>5.5.5</b> I have heard some who maintained that <pl id='Q5860679'>Lepreus</pl> was founded by <prn id='Q122983331'>Leprea</prn>, the daughter of Pyrgeus. Others say that the first dwellers in the land were afflicted with the disease leprosy, and that the city received its name from the misfortune of the inhabitants. The <pl id='Q5860679'>Lepreans</pl> told me that in their city once was a temple of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q107264236'>Leucaeus</prn> (Of the White Poplar), the grave of <prn id='Q609650'>Lycurgus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q1536527'>Aleus</prn>, and the grave of <prn id='Q4207037'>Caucon</prn>, over which was the figure of a man holding a lyre. </p>
<p id='5.5.6'><b>5.5.6</b> But as far as I could see they had no tomb of distinction, and no <pl id='Q38279533'>sanctuary</pl> of any deity save one of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>. Even this was built of unburnt brick, and contained no image. Not far from the city of the <pl id='Q5860679'>Lepreans</pl> is a spring called Arene, and they say that it derives its name from the <prn id='Q641993'>wife</prn> of <prn id='Q578378'>Aphareus</prn>. </p>
<p id='5.5.7'><b>5.5.7</b> Returning again to <pl id='Q3558588'>Samicum</pl>, and passing through the district, we reach the mouth of the <pl id='Q3791516'>Anigrus</pl>. The current of this river is often held back by violent gales, which carry the sand from the open sea against it and stop the onward flow of the water. So whenever the sand has become soaked on both sides, by the sea without and by the river within, beasts and still more travellers on foot are in danger of sinking into it. </p>
<p id='5.5.8'><b>5.5.8</b> The <pl id='Q3791516'>Anigrus</pl> descends from the mountain <pl id='Q6488235'>Lapithus</pl> in <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl>, and right from its source its water does not smell sweet but actually stinks horribly. Before it receives the tributary <pl id='Q3791516'>Acidas</pl> it plainly cannot support fish-life at all. After the rivers unite, the fish that come down into the <pl id='Q3791516'>Anigrus</pl> with the water are uneatable, though before, if they are caught in the <pl id='Q3791516'>Acidas</pl>, they are eatable. </p>
<p id='5.5.9'><b>5.5.9</b> I heard from an <pl id='Q47611'>Ephesian</pl> that the <pl id='Q3791516'>Acidas</pl> was called A923 in ancient times. I repeat his statement, though I have nowhere found evidence in support of it. I am convinced that the peculiar odor of the <pl id='Q3791516'>Anigrus</pl> is due to the earth through which the water springs up, just as those rivers beyond <pl id='Q620874'>Ionia</pl>, the exhalation from which is deadly to man, owe their peculiarity to the same cause. </p>
<p id='5.5.10'><b>5.5.10</b> Some Greeks say that <prn id='Q183417'>Chiron</prn>, others that <prn id='Q16327570'>Pylenor</prn>, another <prn id='Q83203'>Centaur</prn>, when shot by <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> fled wounded to this river and washed his hurt in it, and that it was the <prn id='Q170379'>Hydra</prn>'s poison which gave the <pl id='Q3791516'>Anigrus</pl> its nasty smell. Others again attribute the quality of the river to <prn id='Q602258'>Melampus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q482134'>Amythaon</prn>, who threw into it the means he used to purify the <prn id='Q11827646'>daughters</prn> of <prn id='Q644604'>Proetus</prn>. </p>
<p id='5.5.11'><b>5.5.11</b> There is in <pl id='Q3558588'>Samicum</pl> a cave not far from the river, and called the Cave of the Anigrid <prn id='Q373916'>Nymphs</prn>. Whoever enters it suffering from alphos or leuke first has to pray to the nymphs and to promise some sacrifice or other, after which he wipes the unhealthy parts of his body. Then, swimming through the river, he leaves his old uncleanness in its water, coming up sound and of one color. </p>
<p id='5.6.1'><b>5.6.1</b> Crossing the <pl id='Q3791516'>Anigrus</pl> and going to <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> by the straight road, not far away on the right of the road you reach a high district with a city called <pl id='Q3558588'>Samia</pl> on it. This they say <prn id='Q312008'>Polysperchon</prn> the <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolian</pl> used as a fortified post against the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl>. </p>
<p id='5.6.2'><b>5.6.2</b> As to the ruins of <pl id='Q3558588'>Arene</pl>, no <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> and no <pl id='Q6536845'>Elean</pl> could point them out to me with certainty. Those who care to do so may make all sorts of different guesses about it, but the most plausible account seemed to me that of those who held that in the heroic age and even earlier <pl id='Q3558588'>Samicum</pl> was called <pl id='Q3558588'>Arene</pl>. These quoted too the words of the <prn id='Q8275'>Iliad</prn>: “There is a river MinyeiusYY flowing into the sea near <pl id='Q3558588'>Arene</pl>.” 11.722-3 </p>
<p id='5.6.3'><b>5.6.3</b> These ruins are very near to the <pl id='Q3791516'>Anigrus</pl>; and, although it might be questioned whether <pl id='Q3558588'>Samicum</pl> was called <pl id='Q3558588'>Arene</pl>, yet the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> are agreed that of old the <pl id='Q3791516'>Anigrus</pl> was called the MinyeiusYY. One might well hold that the <pl id='Q1641987'>Neda</pl> near the sea was made the boundary between <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> and <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl> at the time of the return of the <prn id='Q828084'>Heracleidae</prn> to the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl>. </p>
<p id='5.6.4'><b>5.6.4</b> After the <pl id='Q3791516'>Anigrus</pl>, if you travel for a considerable distance through a district that is generally sandy and grows wild pines, you will see behind you on the left the ruins of <pl id='Q733291'>Scillus</pl>. It was one of the cities of <pl id='Q472032'>Triphylia</pl> but in the war between <pl id='Q922329'>Pisa</pl> and <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> the citizens of <pl id='Q733291'>Scillus</pl> openly helped <pl id='Q922329'>Pisa</pl> against her enemy, and for this reason the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> utterly destroyed it. </p>
<p id='5.6.5'><b>5.6.5</b> The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> afterwards separated <pl id='Q733291'>Scillus</pl> from <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> and gave it to <prn id='Q129772'>Xenophon</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q10291570'>Grylus</prn>, when he had been exiled from <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>. The reason for his banishment was that he had taken part in an expedition which <prn id='Q8423'>Cyrus</prn>, the greatest enemy of the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> people, had organized against their friend, the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl> king. <prn id='Q8423'>Cyrus</prn>, in fact, with his seat at <pl id='Q232615'>Sardis</pl>, had been providing <prn id='Q143559'>Lysander</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q56558632'>Aristocritus</prn>, and the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> with money for their fleet. <prn id='Q129772'>Xenophon</prn>, accordingly, was banished and having made <pl id='Q733291'>Scillus</pl> his home he built in honor of <pl id='Q47611'>Ephesian</pl> <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> a temple with a sanctuary and a sacred enclosure. </p>
<p id='5.6.6'><b>5.6.6</b> <pl id='Q733291'>Scillus</pl> is also a hunting-ground for wild <prn id='Q58697'>boars</prn> and deer, and the land is crossed by a river called the Selinus. The guides of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> said that the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> recovered <pl id='Q733291'>Scillus</pl> again, and that <prn id='Q129772'>Xenophon</prn> was tried by the <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> Council for accepting the land from the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, and, obtaining pardon from the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>, dwelt securely in <pl id='Q733291'>Scillus</pl>. Moreover, at a little distance from the sanctuary was shown a tomb, and upon the grave is a statue of marble from the <pl id='Q1125206'>Pentelic</pl> quarry. The neighbors say that it is the tomb of <prn id='Q129772'>Xenophon</prn>. </p>
<p id='5.6.7'><b>5.6.7</b> As you go from <pl id='Q733291'>Scillus</pl> along the road to <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>, before you cross the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl>, there is a mountain with high, precipitous cliffs. It is called Mount <pl id='Q15205657'>Typaeum</pl>. It is a law of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> to cast down it any women who are caught present at the <prn id='Q188468'>Olympic games</prn>, or even on the other side of the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl>, on the days prohibited to women. However, they say that no woman has been caught, except <prn id='Q547838'>Callipateira</prn> only; some, however, give the lady the name of Pherenice and not <prn id='Q547838'>Callipateira</prn>. </p>
<p id='5.6.8'><b>5.6.8</b> She, being a widow, disguised herself exactly like a gymnastic trainer, and brought her son to compete at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>. <prn id='Q24576441'>Peisirodus</prn>, for so her son was called, was victorious, and <prn id='Q547838'>Callipateira</prn>, as she was jumping over the enclosure in which they keep the trainers shut up, bared her person. So her sex was discovered, but they let her go unpunished out of respect for her father, her brothers and her son, all of whom had been victorious at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>. But a law was passed that for the future trainers should strip before entering the arena. </p>
<p id='5.7.1'><b>5.7.1</b> By the time you reach <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl> is a large and very pleasant river to see, being fed by several tributaries, including seven very important ones. The <pl id='Q15137556'>Helisson</pl> joins the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl> passing through <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl>; the <pl id='Q12874732'>Brentheates</pl> comes out of the territory of that city; past <pl id='Q1136193'>Gortyna</pl>, where is a sanctuary of Asclepius, flows the <pl id='Q1872337'>Gortynius</pl>; from <pl id='Q11936409'>Melaeneae</pl>, between the territories of <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl> and <pl id='Q3562285'>Heraea</pl>, comes the <prn id='Q3646522'>Buphagus</prn>; from the land of the <pl id='Q2537130'>Clitorians</pl> the <pl id='Q1462727'>Ladon</pl>; from Mount <pl id='Q1363703'>Erymanthus</pl> a <pl id='Q3555227'>stream</pl> with the same name as the mountain. These come down into the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl> from <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl>; the <pl id='Q647970'>Cladeus</pl> comes from <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> to join it. The source of the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl> itself is in <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl>, and not in <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>. </p>
<p id='5.7.2'><b>5.7.2</b> There is another legend about the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl>. They say that there was a hunter called <prn id='Q911084'>Alpheius</prn>, who fell in love with <prn id='Q643456'>Arethusa</prn>, who was herself a huntress. <pl id='Q3747483'>Arethusa</pl>, unwilling to marry, crossed, they say, to the island opposite <pl id='Q4420718'>Syracuse</pl> called <pl id='Q65070185'>Ortygia</pl>, and there turned from a woman to a spring. <prn id='Q911084'>Alpheius</prn> too was changed by his love into the river. </p>
<p id='5.7.3'><b>5.7.3</b> This account of <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl> . . . to <pl id='Q1233234'>Ortygia</pl>. But that the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl> passes through the sea and mingles his waters with the spring at this place I cannot disbelieve, as I know that the god at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> confirms the story. For when he despatched <prn id='Q633041'>Archias</prn> the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthian</pl> to found <pl id='Q4420718'>Syracuse</pl> he uttered this oracle: “An isle, <pl id='Q1233234'>Ortygia</pl>, lies on the misty ocean Over against <pl id='Q4951156'>Trinacria</pl>, where the mouth of <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl> bubbles Mingling with the springs of broad <pl id='Q3747483'>Arethusa</pl>.” For this reason, therefore, because the water of the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl> mingles with the <pl id='Q3747483'>Arethusa</pl>, I am convinced that the legend arose of the river's love-affair. </p>
<p id='5.7.4'><b>5.7.4</b> Those Greeks or <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptians</pl> who have gone up into <pl id='Q410453'>Ethiopia</pl> beyond <pl id='Q29888'>Syene</pl> as far as the Ethiopian city of <pl id='Q5780'>Meroe</pl> all say that the <pl id='Q3392'>Nile</pl> enters a lake, and passes through it as though it were dry land, and that after this it flows through lower <pl id='Q410453'>Aethiopia</pl> into <pl id='Q11768'>Egypt</pl> before coming down into the sea at <pl id='Q43244'>Pharos</pl>. And in the land of the <prn id='Q7325'>Hebrews</prn>, as I can myself bear witness, the river <pl id='Q40059'>Jordan</pl> passes through a lake called <pl id='Q151920'>Tiberias</pl>, and then, entering another lake called the <pl id='Q23883'>Dead Sea</pl>, it disappears in it. </p>
<p id='5.7.5'><b>5.7.5</b> The <pl id='Q23883'>Dead Sea</pl> has the opposite qualities to those of any other water. Living creatures float in it naturally without swimming; dying creatures sink to the bottom. Hence the lake is barren of fish; their danger stares them in the face, and they flee back to the water which is their native element. The peculiarity of the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl> is shared by a river of <pl id='Q620874'>Ionia</pl>. The source of it is on Mount <pl id='Q1330828'>Mycale</pl>, and having gone through the intervening sea the river rises again opposite <pl id='Q671358'>Branchidae</pl> at the harbor called <pl id='Q60791437'>Panormos</pl>. </p>
<p id='5.7.6'><b>5.7.6</b> These things then are as I have described them. As for the <prn id='Q188468'>Olympic games</prn>, the most learned antiquaries of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> say that <prn id='Q44204'>Cronus</prn> was the first king of heaven, and that in his honor a temple was built in <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> by the men of that age, who were named the Golden Race. When <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> was born, <prn id='Q108419'>Rhea</prn> entrusted the guardianship of her son to the <prn id='Q831589'>Dactyls</prn> of <pl id='Q1127771'>Ida</pl>, who are the same as those called <prn id='Q247617'>Curetes</prn>. They came from <pl id='Q4752820'>Cretan</pl> <pl id='Q1127771'>Ida</pl> — <prn id='Q106803123'>Heracles</prn>, <prn id='Q1639138'>Paeonaeus</prn>, <prn id='Q1347121'>Epimedes</prn>, <prn id='Q106803870'>Iasius</prn> and <prn id='Q106804079'>Idas</prn>. </p>
<p id='5.7.7'><b>5.7.7</b> <prn id='Q106803123'>Heracles</prn>, being the eldest, matched his brothers, as a game, in a running-race, and crowned the winner with a branch of wild olive, of which they had such a copious supply that they slept on heaps of its leaves while still green.

<p id='5.7.8'><b>5.7.8</b> <prn id='Q978308'>Olen</prn> the <pl id='Q18927'>Lycian</pl>, in his hymn to <prn id='Q106802838'>Achaeia</prn>, was the first to say that from these <prn id='Q12871715'>Hyperboreans</prn> <prn id='Q106802838'>Achaeia</prn> came to <pl id='Q173148'>Delos</pl>. When <prn id='Q11936429'>Melanopus</prn> of <pl id='Q679305'>Cyme</pl> composed an ode to <prn id='Q2026930'>Opis</prn> and <prn id='Q62132565'>Hecaerge</prn> declaring that these, even before <prn id='Q106802838'>Achaeia</prn>, came to <pl id='Q173148'>Delos</pl> from the <prn id='Q12871715'>Hyperboreans</prn>. </p>
<p id='5.7.9'><b>5.7.9</b> And <prn id='Q520917'>Aristeas</prn> of <pl id='Q950908'>Proconnesus</pl> — for he too made mention of the <prn id='Q12871715'>Hyperboreans</prn> — may perhaps have learnt even more about them from the <prn id='Q1079061'>Issedones</prn>, to whom he says in his poem that he came. <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> of <pl id='Q1127771'>Ida</pl>, therefore, has the reputation of being the first to have held, on the occasion I mentioned, the games, and to have called them <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl>. So he established the custom of holding them every fifth year, because he and his brothers were five in number. </p>
<p id='5.7.10'><b>5.7.10</b> Now some say that <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> wrestled here with <prn id='Q44204'>Cronus</prn> himself for the throne, while others say that he held the games in honor of his victory over <prn id='Q44204'>Cronus</prn>. The record of victors include <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, who outran <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> and beat <prn id='Q40901'>Ares</prn> at boxing. It is for this reason, they say, that the <pl id='Q682558'>Pythian</pl> flute-song is played while the competitors in the pentathlum are jumping; for the flute-song is sacred to <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, and <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> won <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> victories. </p>
<p id='5.8.1'><b>5.8.1</b> Later on there came (they say) from <pl id='Q4752820'>Crete</pl> <prn id='Q16663935'>Clymenus</prn>, the son of Cardys, about fifty years after the flood came upon the Greeks in the time of <prn id='Q207715'>Deucalion</prn>. He was descended from <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> of <pl id='Q1127771'>Ida</pl>; he held the games at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> and set up an altar in honor of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, his ancestor, and the other <prn id='Q247617'>Curetes</prn>, giving to <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> the surname of <prn id='Q107040833'>Parastates</prn> (Assistant). And <prn id='Q272047'>Endymion</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q381931'>Aethlius</prn>, deposed <prn id='Q16663935'>Clymenus</prn>, and set his sons a race in <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> with the kingdom as the prize. </p>
<p id='5.8.2'><b>5.8.2</b> And about a generation later than <prn id='Q272047'>Endymion</prn>, <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn> held the games in honor of <prn id='Q106460486'>Olympian</prn> <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> in a more splendid manner than any of his predecessors. When the sons of <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn> were scattered from <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> over all the rest of <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl>, <prn id='Q482134'>Amythaon</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q869665'>Cretheus</prn>, and cousin of <prn id='Q272047'>Endymion</prn> on his father's side (for they say that <prn id='Q381931'>Aethlius</prn> too was the son of <prn id='Q406388'>Aeolus</prn>, though supposed to be a son of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>), held the <pl id='Q38888'>Olympian</pl> games, and after him <prn id='Q182439'>Pelias</prn> and <prn id='Q637955'>Neleus</prn> in common. </p>
<p id='5.8.3'><b>5.8.3</b> <prn id='Q207663'>Augeas</prn> too held them, and likewise <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q206214'>Amphitryon</prn>, after the conquest of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>. The victors crowned by <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> include <prn id='Q504076'>Iolaus</prn>, who won with the mares of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>. So of old a competitor was permitted to compete with mares which were not his own. <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>, at any rate, in the games held in honor of <prn id='Q186271'>Patroclus</prn>, has told how <prn id='Q171839'>Menelaus</prn> drove a pair of which one was <prn id='Q21548022'>Aetha</prn>, a mare of <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn>, while the other was his own <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn>. </p>
<p id='5.8.4'><b>5.8.4</b> Moreover, <prn id='Q504076'>Iolaus</prn> used to be charioteer to <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>. So <prn id='Q504076'>Iolaus</prn> won the chariot-race, and <prn id='Q16559355'>Iasius</prn>, an <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadian</pl>, the horse-race; while of the sons of <prn id='Q192946'>Tyndareus</prn> one won the foot-race and <prn id='Q190103'>Polydeuces</prn> the boxing-match. Of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> himself it is said that he won victories at wrestling and the pancratium. </p>
<p id='5.8.5'><b>5.8.5</b> After the reign of <prn id='Q575252'>Oxylus</prn>, who also celebrated the games, the <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> festival was discontinued until the reign of <prn id='Q2298655'>Iphitus</prn>. When <prn id='Q2298655'>Iphitus</prn>, as I have already related, renewed the games, men had by this time forgotten the ancient tradition, the memory of which revived bit by bit, and as it revived they made additions to the games. </p>
<p id='5.8.6'><b>5.8.6</b> This I can prove; for when the unbroken tradition of the Olympiads began there was first the foot-race, and <prn id='Q45098'>Coroebus</prn> an <pl id='Q6536845'>Elean</pl> was victor [776 BCE]. There is no statue of <prn id='Q45098'>Coroebus</prn> at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>, but his grave is on the borders of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>. Afterwards, at the <prn id='Q11851954'>fourteenth Olympiad</prn> [724 BCE], the double foot-race was added: <prn id='Q5957488'>Hypenus</prn> of <pl id='Q922329'>Pisa</pl> won the prize of wild olive in the double race, and at the <prn id='Q57337677'>next Olympiad</prn> <prn id='Q2822600'>Acanthus</prn> of <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl> won in the long course [720 BCE]. </p>
<p id='5.8.7'><b>5.8.7</b> At the <prn id='Q57337681'>eighteenth Olympiad</prn> [708 BCE] they remembered the pentathlum and wrestling. <prn id='Q20493429'>Lampis</prn> won the first and <prn id='Q18010038'>Eurybatus</prn> the second, these also being <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. At the <prn id='Q57337688'>twenty-third Olympiad</prn> [688 BCE] they restored the prizes for boxing, and the victor was <prn id='Q7094480'>Onomastus</prn> of <pl id='Q1379299'>Smyrna</pl>, which already was a part of <pl id='Q620874'>Ionia</pl>. At the twenty-fifth they recognized the race of full-grown <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn>, and <prn id='Q1397559'>Pagondas</prn> of <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> was proclaimed “victor in the chariot-race.” [680 BCE] </p>
<p id='5.8.8'><b>5.8.8</b> At the <prn id='Q57337701'>eighth Olympiad after this</prn> [648 BCE] they admitted the pancratium for men and the horse-race. The horse-race was won by <prn id='Q20851907'>Crauxidas</prn> of <pl id='Q56427665'>Crannon</pl>, and <prn id='Q16516302'>Lygdamis</prn> of <pl id='Q4420718'>Syracuse</pl> overcame all who entered for the pancratium. <prn id='Q16516302'>Lygdamis</prn> has his tomb near the quarries at <pl id='Q4420718'>Syracuse</pl>, and according to the <pl id='Q4420718'>Syracusans</pl> he was as big as <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> of <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>, though I cannot vouch for the statement. </p>
<p id='5.8.9'><b>5.8.9</b> The contests for boys have no authority in old tradition, but were established by the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> themselves because they approved of them. The prizes for running and wrestling open to boys were instituted at the <prn id='Q57337705'>thirty-seventh Olympiad</prn> [632 BCE]; <prn id='Q18986572'>Hipposthenes</prn> of <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl> won the prize for wrestling, and that for running was won by <prn id='Q20056739'>Polyneices</prn> of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>. At the <prn id='Q57337711'>forty-first Olympiad</prn> [616 BCE] they introduced boxing for boys, and the winner out of those who entered for it was <prn id='Q20056736'>Philytas</prn> of <pl id='Q220583'>Sybaris</pl>. </p>
<p id='5.8.10'><b>5.8.10</b> The race for men in armour was approved at the <prn id='Q57337744'>sixty-fifth Olympiad</prn> [520 BCE], to provide, I suppose, military training; the first winner of the race with shields was <prn id='Q20493414'>Damaretus</prn> of <pl id='Q3562285'>Heraea</pl>. The race for two full-grown <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn>, called synoris (chariot and pair), was instituted at the <prn id='Q57337781'>ninety-third Olympiad</prn> [408 BCE], and the winner was <prn id='Q27924290'>Evagoras</prn> of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>. At the <prn id='Q57337790'>ninety-ninth Olympiad</prn> [384 BCE] they resolved to hold contests for chariots drawn by foals, and <prn id='Q22978063'>Sybariades</prn> of <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl> won the garland with his chariot and foals. </p>
<p id='5.8.11'><b>5.8.11</b> Afterwards they added races for chariots and pairs of foals, and for single foals with rider. It is said that the victors proclaimed were: for the chariot and pair, <prn id='Q468821'>Belistiche</prn>, a woman from the seaboard of <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl>; for the ridden race, <prn id='Q106801522'>Tlepolemus</prn> of <pl id='Q18927'>Lycia</pl>. <prn id='Q106801522'>Tlepolemus</prn>, they say, won at the <prn id='Q57337829'>hundred and thirty-first Olympiad</prn> [256 BCE], and <prn id='Q468821'>Belistiche</prn> at the third before this [264 BCE]. At the <prn id='Q57337847'>hundred and forty-fifth Olympiad</prn> [200 BCE] prizes were offered for boys in the pancratium, the victory falling to <prn id='Q26258877'>Phaedimus</prn>, an <pl id='Q255325'>Aeolian</pl> from the city <pl id='Q1393407'>Troas</pl>. </p>
<p id='5.9.1'><b>5.9.1</b> Certain contests, too, have been dropped at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>, the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> resolving to discontinue them. The pentathlum for boys was instituted at the <prn id='Q57337707'>thirty-eighth Olympiad</prn> [628 BCE]; but after <prn id='Q1378789'>Eutelidas</prn> of <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedaemon</pl> had received the wild olive for it, the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> disapproved of boys entering for this competition. The races for mule-carts, and the trotting-race, were instituted respectively at the <prn id='Q57337751'>seventieth Olympiad</prn> and the seventy-first, but were both abolished by proclamation at the eighty-fourth. When they were first instituted, <prn id='Q20493485'>Thersius</prn> of <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessaly</pl> won the race for mule-carts, while <prn id='Q20493290'>Pataecus</prn>, an <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaean</pl> from <pl id='Q1231662'>Dyme</pl>, won the trotting-race. </p>
<p id='5.9.2'><b>5.9.2</b> The trotting-race was for mares, and in the last part of the course the riders jumped off and ran beside the mares, holding on to the bridle, just as at the present day those do who are called “mounters.” The mounters, however, differ from the riders in the trotting-race by having different badges, and by riding <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn> instead of mares. The cart-race was neither of venerable antiquity nor yet a graceful performance. Moreover, each cart was drawn by a pair of mules, not <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn>, and there is an ancient curse on the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> if this animal is even born in <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>. </p>
<p id='5.9.3'><b>5.9.3</b> The order of the games in our own day, which places the sacrifices to the god for the pentathlum and chariot-races second, and those for the other competitions first, was fixed at the <prn id='Q57337759'>seventy-seventh Olympiad</prn>. Previously the contests for men and for <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn> were held on the same day. But at the Olympiad I mentioned the pancratiasts prolonged their contests till night-fall, because they were not summoned to the arena soon enough. The cause of the delay was partly the chariot-race, but still more the pentathlum. <prn id='Q24081455'>Callias</prn> of <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> was champion of the pancratiasts on this occasion, but never afterwards was the pancratium to be interfered with by the pentathlum or the chariots. </p>
<p id='5.9.4'><b>5.9.4</b> The rules for the presidents of the games are not the same now as they were at the first institution of the festival. <prn id='Q2298655'>Iphitus</prn> acted as sole president, as likewise did the descendants of <prn id='Q575252'>Oxylus</prn> after <prn id='Q2298655'>Iphitus</prn>. But at the <prn id='Q57337722'>fiftieth Olympiad</prn> two men, appointed by lot from all the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>, were entrusted with the management of the <prn id='Q188468'>Olympic games</prn>, and for a long time after this the number of the presidents continued to be two. </p>
<p id='5.9.5'><b>5.9.5</b> But at the <prn id='Q57337784'>ninety-fifth Olympiad</prn> [400 BCE] nine umpires were appointed. To three of them were entrusted the chariot-races, another three were to supervise the pentathlum, the rest superintended the remaining contests. At the <prn id='Q57337450'>second Olympiad</prn> after this the tenth umpire was added. At the <prn id='Q57337794'>hundred and third Olympiad</prn> [368 BCE], the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> having twelve tribes, one umpire was chosen from each. </p>
<p id='5.9.6'><b>5.9.6</b> But they were hard pressed in a war with the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> and lost a portion of their territory, along with all the demes included in the surrendered district, and so the number of tribes was reduced to eight in the <prn id='Q57337796'>hundred and fourth Olympiad</prn> [364 BCE]. Thereupon were chosen umpires equal in number to the tribes. At the <prn id='Q57337801'>hundred and eighth Olympiad</prn> [354 BCE] they returned again to the number of ten umpires, which has continued unchanged down to the present day. </p>
<p id='5.10.1'><b>5.10.1</b> Many are the sights to be seen in Greece, and many are the wonders to be heard; but on nothing does Heaven bestow more care than on the <pl id='Q94299853'>Eleusinian</pl> rites and the <prn id='Q188468'>Olympic games</prn>. The sacred grove of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> has been called from of old <pl id='Q2400346'>Altis</pl>, a corruption of the word “alsos,” which means a grove. <prn id='Q134929'>Pindar</prn> too calls the place <pl id='Q2400346'>Altis</pl> in an ode composed for an <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> victor. </p>
<p id='5.10.2'><b>5.10.2</b> The <pl id='Q197019'>temple</pl> and the <prn id='Q46239'>image</prn> were made for <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> from spoils, when <pl id='Q922329'>Pisa</pl> was crushed in war by the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>, and with <pl id='Q922329'>Pisa</pl> such of the subject peoples as conspired together with her. The <prn id='Q46239'>image</prn> itself was wrought by <prn id='Q177302'>Pheidias</prn>, as is testified by an inscription written under the feet of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>: “<prn id='Q177302'>Pheidias</prn>, son of <prn id='Q29167176'>Charmides</prn>, an <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl>, made me.” The <pl id='Q197019'>temple</pl> is in the <prn id='Q192664'>Doric</prn> style, and the outside has columns all around it. It is built of native stone. </p>
<p id='5.10.3'><b>5.10.3</b> Its height up to the <pl id='Q197019'>pediment</pl> is sixty-eight feet, its breadth is ninety-five, its length two hundred and thirty. The architect was <prn id='Q1823070'>Libon</prn>, a native. The tiles are not of baked earth, but of <pl id='Q1125206'>Pentelic</pl> marble cut into the shape of tiles. The invention is said to be that of <prn id='Q15905786'>Byzes</prn> of <pl id='Q96575378'>Naxos</pl>, who they say made the images in <pl id='Q96575378'>Naxos</pl> on which is the inscription: “To the offspring of <prn id='Q103107'>Leto</prn> was I dedicated by <prn id='Q106800921'>Euergus</prn>, A <pl id='Q96575378'>Naxian</pl>, son of <prn id='Q15905786'>Byzes</prn>, who first made tiles of stone.” This <prn id='Q15905786'>Byzes</prn> lived about the time of <prn id='Q299551'>Alyattes</prn> the <pl id='Q620765'>Lydian</pl>, when <prn id='Q271527'>Astyages</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q297855'>Cyaxares</prn>, reigned over the <pl id='Q3853673'>Medes</pl>. </p>
<p id='5.10.4'><b>5.10.4</b> At <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> a gilt caldron stands on each end of the roof, and a <prn id='Q165023'>Victory</prn>, also gilt, is set in about the middle of the <pl id='Q197019'>pediment</pl>. Under the image of <prn id='Q165023'>Victory</prn> has been dedicated a golden shield, with <prn id='Q160730'>Medusa</prn> the <prn id='Q160730'>Gorgon</prn> in relief. The inscription on the shield declares who dedicated it and the reason why they did so. It runs thus: “The <pl id='Q197019'>temple</pl> has a golden shield; from <pl id='Q56259452'>Tanagra</pl>. The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> and their allies dedicated it, a gift taken from the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>, <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> and <pl id='Q620874'>Ionians</pl>, The tithe offered for victory in war.” This battle I also mentioned in my history of <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl>, Then I described the tombs that are at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>. </p>
<p id='5.10.5'><b>5.10.5</b> On the outside of the frieze that runs round the <pl id='Q197019'>temple</pl> at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>, above the columns, are gilt shields one and twenty in number, an offering made by the Roman general <prn id='Q445455'>Mummius</prn> when he had conquered the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> in war, captured <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl>, and driven out its <prn id='Q203711'>Dorian</prn> inhabitants. </p>

An image of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> has been carved in about the middle of the <pl id='Q197019'>pediment</pl>; on the right of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> is <prn id='Q847890'>Oenomaus</prn> with a helmet on his head, and by him <prn id='Q748963'>Sterope</prn> his wife, who was one of the daughters of <prn id='Q130818'>Atlas</prn>. <prn id='Q615912'>Myrtilus</prn> too, the charioteer of <prn id='Q847890'>Oenomaus</prn>, sits in front of the <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn>, which are four in number. After him are two men. They have no names, but they too must be under orders from <prn id='Q847890'>Oenomaus</prn> to attend to the <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn>. </p>
<p id='5.10.7'><b>5.10.7</b> At the very edge lies <pl id='Q647970'>Cladeus</pl>, the river which, in other ways also, the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> honor most after the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl>.

Then the <pl id='Q197019'>pediment</pl> narrows again, and in this part of it is represented the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl>. The name of the charioteer of <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn> is, according to the account of the <pl id='Q581494'>Troezenians</pl>, <prn id='Q3676709'>Sphaerus</prn>, but the guide at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> called him <prn id='Q3676709'>Cillas</prn>. </p>
<p id='5.10.8'><b>5.10.8</b> The sculptures in the front <pl id='Q197019'>pediment</pl> are by <prn id='Q545845'>Paeonius</prn>, who came from <pl id='Q3305786'>Mende</pl> in <pl id='Q41741'>Thrace</pl>; those in the back <pl id='Q197019'>pediment</pl> are by <prn id='Q505640'>Alcamenes</prn>, a contemporary of <prn id='Q177302'>Pheidias</prn>, ranking next after him for skill as a sculptor. What he carved on the <pl id='Q197019'>pediment</pl> is the fight between the <prn id='Q334794'>Lapithae</prn> and the <prn id='Q83203'>Centaurs</prn> at the marriage of <prn id='Q502156'>Peirithous</prn>. In the center of the <pl id='Q197019'>pediment</pl> is <prn id='Q502156'>Peirithous</prn>. On one side of him is <prn id='Q1378578'>Eurytion</prn>, who has seized the wife of <prn id='Q502156'>Peirithous</prn>, with <prn id='Q1132772'>Caeneus</prn> bringing help to <prn id='Q502156'>Peirithous</prn>, and on the other side is <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> defending himself against the <prn id='Q83203'>Centaurs</prn> with an axe. One <prn id='Q83203'>Centaur</prn> has seized a maid, another a boy in the prime of youth. <prn id='Q505640'>Alcamenes</prn>, I think, carved this scene, because he had learned from <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>'s poem that <prn id='Q502156'>Peirithous</prn> was a son of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, and because he knew that <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> was a great grandson of <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn>. </p>
<p id='5.10.9'><b>5.10.9</b> Most of the labours of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> are represented at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>. Above the doors of the <pl id='Q197019'>temple</pl> is carved the hunting of the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadian</pl> <prn id='Q334456'>boar</prn>, his exploit against <prn id='Q393186'>Diomedes</prn> the Thracian, and that against <prn id='Q86805'>Geryones</prn> at <pl id='Q5890310'>Erytheia</pl>; he is also about to receive the burden of <prn id='Q130818'>Atlas</prn>, and he cleanses the land from dung for the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>. Above the doors of the rear chamber he is taking the girdle from the <prn id='Q134154'>Amazon</prn>; and there are the affairs of the deer, of the <prn id='Q129866'>bull</prn> at <pl id='Q173527'>Cnossus</pl>, of the <prn id='Q236429'>Stymphalian birds</prn>, of the <prn id='Q170379'>Hydra</prn>, and of the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl> <prn id='Q140'>lion</prn>. </p>
<p id='5.10.10'><b>5.10.10</b> As you enter the bronze doors you see on the right, before the pillar, <prn id='Q2298655'>Iphitus</prn> being crowned by a woman, <prn id='Q106800538'>Ececheiria</prn> (Truce), as the elegiac couplet on the statue says. Within the <pl id='Q197019'>temple</pl> stand pillars, and inside also are porticoes above, with an approach through them to the image. There has also been constructed a winding ascent to the roof. </p>
<p id='5.11.1'><b>5.11.1</b> The god sits on a throne, and he is made of gold and ivory. On his head lies a garland which is a copy of olive shoots. In his right hand he carries a <prn id='Q165023'>Victory</prn>, which, like the statue, is of ivory and gold; she wears a ribbon and — on her head — a garland. In the left hand of the god is a scepter, ornamented with every kind of metal, and the bird sitting on the scepter is the <prn id='Q2092297'>eagle</prn>. The sandals also of the god are of gold, as is likewise his robe. On the robe are embroidered figures of animals and the flowers of the lily. </p>
<p id='5.11.2'><b>5.11.2</b> The throne is adorned with gold and with jewels, to say nothing of ebony and ivory. Upon it are painted figures and wrought images. There are four Victories, represented as dancing women, one at each foot of the throne, and two others at the base of each foot. On each of the two front feet are set <pl id='Q11225429'>Theban</pl> children ravished by sphinxes, while under the sphinxes <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> and <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> are shooting down the children of <prn id='Q213621'>Niobe</prn>. </p>
<p id='5.11.3'><b>5.11.3</b> Between the feet of the throne are four rods, each one stretching from foot to foot. The rod straight opposite the entrance has on it seven images; how the eighth of them disappeared nobody knows. These must be intended to be copies of obsolete contests, since in the time of <prn id='Q177302'>Pheidias</prn> contests for boys had not yet been introduced. The figure of one binding his own head with a ribbon is said to resemble in appearance <prn id='Q20493279'>Pantarces</prn>, a stripling of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> said to have been the love of <prn id='Q177302'>Pheidias</prn>. <prn id='Q20493279'>Pantarces</prn> too won the wrestling-bout for boys at the <prn id='Q57337772'>eighty-sixth Olympiad</prn>. </p>
<p id='5.11.4'><b>5.11.4</b> On the other rods is the band that with <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> fights against the <prn id='Q134154'>Amazons</prn>. The number of figures in the two parties is twenty-nine, and <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> too is ranged among the allies of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>. The throne is supported not only by the feet, but also by an equal number of pillars standing between the feet. It is impossible to go under the throne, in the way we enter the inner part of the throne at <pl id='Q13074886'>Amyclae</pl>. At <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> there are screens constructed like walls which keep people out. </p>
<p id='5.11.5'><b>5.11.5</b> Of these screens the part opposite the doors is only covered with dark-blue paint; the other parts show pictures by <prn id='Q715817'>Panaenus</prn>. Among them is <prn id='Q130818'>Atlas</prn>, supporting heaven and earth, by whose side stands <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> ready to receive the load of <prn id='Q130818'>Atlas</prn>, along with <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>; <prn id='Q502156'>Perithous</prn>, <prn id='Q11772'>Hellas</prn>, and <pl id='Q202422'>Salamis</pl> carrying in her hand the ornament made for the top of a ship's bows; then <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>' exploit against the <prn id='Q199438'>Nemean lion</prn>, the outrage committed by <prn id='Q242319'>Ajax</prn> on <prn id='Q170779'>Cassandra</prn>, </p>
<p id='5.11.6'><b>5.11.6</b> <prn id='Q328354'>Hippodameia</prn> the daughter of <prn id='Q847890'>Oenomaus</prn> with her mother, and <prn id='Q83160'>Prometheus</prn> still held by his chains, though <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> has been raised up to him. For among the stories told about <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> is one that he killed the <prn id='Q2092297'>eagle</prn> which tormented <prn id='Q83160'>Prometheus</prn> in the <pl id='Q5477'>Caucasus</pl>, and set free <prn id='Q83160'>Prometheus</prn> himself from his chains. Last in the picture come <prn id='Q379828'>Penthesileia</prn> giving up the ghost and <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn> supporting her; two <prn id='Q206187'>Hesperides</prn> are carrying the apples, the keeping of which, legend says, had been entrusted to them. This <prn id='Q715817'>Panaenus</prn> was a brother of <prn id='Q177302'>Pheidias</prn>; he also painted the picture of the battle of <pl id='Q31900'>Marathon</pl> in the <pl id='Q936234'>Poikile Stoa</pl> at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>. </p>
<p id='5.11.7'><b>5.11.7</b> On the uppermost parts of the throne <prn id='Q177302'>Pheidias</prn> has made, above the head of the image, three <prn id='Q184353'>Graces</prn> on one side and three <prn id='Q201411'>Seasons</prn> on the other. These in epic poetry are included among the daughters of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>. <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> too in the <prn id='Q8275'>Iliad</prn> says that the <prn id='Q201411'>Seasons</prn> have been entrusted with the sky, just like guards of a king's court. The footstool of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, called by the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> thranion, has golden <prn id='Q140'>lions</prn> and, in relief, the fight of <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> against the <prn id='Q134154'>Amazons</prn>, the first brave deed of the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> against foreigners. </p>
<p id='5.11.8'><b>5.11.8</b> On the pedestal supporting the throne and <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> with all his adornments are works in gold: the <prn id='Q134270'>Sun</prn> mounted on a chariot, <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> and <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn>, <prn id='Q44384'>Hephaestus</prn>, and by his side <prn id='Q184353'>Grace</prn>. Close to her comes <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn>, and close to <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> <prn id='Q41419'>Hestia</prn>. After <prn id='Q41419'>Hestia</prn> is <prn id='Q121973'>Eros</prn> receiving <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> as she rises from the sea, and <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> is being crowned by <prn id='Q611171'>Persuasion</prn>. There are also reliefs of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> with <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> and of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>; and near the end of the pedestal <prn id='Q180222'>Amphitrite</prn> and <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, while the <prn id='Q131585'>Moon</prn> is driving what I think is a <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn>. Some have said that the steed of the goddess is a mule not a <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn>, and they tell a silly story about the mule. </p>
<p id='5.11.9'><b>5.11.9</b> I know that the height and breadth of the <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> have been measured and recorded; but I shall not praise those who made the measurements, for even their records fall far short of the impression made by a sight of the image. Nay, the god himself according to legend bore witness to the artistic skill of <prn id='Q177302'>Pheidias</prn>. For when the image was quite finished <prn id='Q177302'>Pheidias</prn> prayed the god to show by a sign whether the work was to his liking. Immediately, runs the legend, a thunderbolt fell on that part of the floor where down to the present day the bronze jar stood to cover the place. </p>
<p id='5.11.10'><b>5.11.10</b> All the floor in front of the image is paved, not with white, but with black tiles. In a circle round the black stone runs a raised rim of <pl id='Q65040323'>Parian</pl> marble, to keep in the olive oil that is poured out. For olive oil is beneficial to the image at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>, and it is olive oil that keeps the ivory from being harmed by the marshiness of the <pl id='Q2400346'>Altis</pl>. On the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> <pl id='Q131013'>Acropolis</pl> the ivory of the image they call the Parthenos is benefited, not by olive oil, but by water. For the <pl id='Q131013'>Acropolis</pl>, owing to its great height, is over-dry, so that the image, being made of ivory, needs water or dampness. </p>
<p id='5.11.11'><b>5.11.11</b> When I asked at <pl id='Q7698713'>Epidaurus</pl> why they pour neither water nor olive oil on the image of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>, the attendants at the sanctuary informed me that both the image of the god and the throne were built over a cistern. </p>
<p id='5.12.1'><b>5.12.1</b> Those who think that the projections from the mouth of an elephant are not horns but teeth of the animal should consider both the elk, a beast of the <pl id='Q35966'>Celtic</pl> land, and also the <pl id='Q410453'>Aethiopian</pl> <prn id='Q693690'>bull</prn>. Male elks have horns on their brows, but the female does not grow them at all. Ethiopian <prn id='Q693690'>bulls</prn> grow their horns on their noses. Who therefore would be greatly surprised at horns growing out of an animal's mouth? </p>
<p id='5.12.2'><b>5.12.2</b> They may also correct their error from the following considerations. Horns drop off animals each year and grow again; the deer and the antelope undergo this experience, and so likewise does the elephant. But a tooth will never be found to grow again, at least after the animal is full-grown. So if the projections through the mouth were teeth and not horns, how could they grow up again? Again, a tooth refuses to yield to fire; but fire turns the horns of <prn id='Q473194'>oxen</prn> and elephants from round to flat, and also into other shapes. However, the hippopotamus and the <prn id='Q58697'>boar</prn> have tusks growing out of the lower jaw, but we do not see horns growing out of jaws. </p>
<p id='5.12.3'><b>5.12.3</b> So be assured that an elephant's horns descend through the temples from above, and so bend outwards. My statement is not hearsay; I once saw an elephant's skull in the sanctuary of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> in Campania. The sanctuary is about thirty stades from <pl id='Q3136685'>Capua</pl>, which is the capital of Campania. So the elephant differs from all other animals in the way its horns grow, just as its size and shape are peculiar to itself. And the Greeks in my opinion showed an unsurpassed zeal and generosity in honoring the gods, in that they imported ivory from <pl id='Q17055962'>India</pl> and <pl id='Q410453'>Aethiopia</pl> to make images. </p>
<p id='5.12.4'><b>5.12.4</b> In <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> there is a woollen curtain, adorned with AssyrianYY weaving and <pl id='Q41642'>Phoenician</pl> purple, which was dedicated by <prn id='Q211488'>Antiochus</prn>, who also gave as offerings the golden aegis with the <prn id='Q102059'>Gorgon</prn> on it above the <pl id='Q1227044'>theater</pl> at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>. This curtain is not drawn upwards to the roof as is that in the <pl id='Q43018'>temple</pl> of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> at <pl id='Q47611'>Ephesus</pl>, but it is let down to the ground by cords. </p>
<p id='5.12.5'><b>5.12.5</b> The offerings inside, or in the fore-<pl id='Q197019'>temple</pl> include: a throne of <prn id='Q106799694'>Arimnestus</prn>, king of the <pl id='Q206730'>Tyrrhenians</pl>, who was the first foreigner to present an offering to the <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, and bronze <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn> of <prn id='Q267195'>Cynisca</prn>, tokens of an <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> victory. These are not as large as real <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn>, and stand in the fore-<pl id='Q197019'>temple</pl> on the right as you enter. There is also a tripod, plated with bronze, upon which, before the table was made, were displayed the crowns for the victors. </p>
<p id='5.12.6'><b>5.12.6</b> There are statues of emperors: <prn id='Q1427'>Hadrian</prn>, of <pl id='Q65040323'>Parian</pl> marble dedicated by the cities of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaean</pl> confederacy, and <prn id='Q1425'>Trajan</prn>, dedicated by all the Greeks. This emperor subdued the <pl id='Q19012'>Getae</pl> beyond <pl id='Q41741'>Thrace</pl>, and made war on <prn id='Q318162'>Osroes</prn> the descendant of <prn id='Q315913'>Arsaces</prn> and on the <pl id='Q1645483'>Parthians</pl>. Of his architectural achievements the most remarkable are <pl id='Q599035'>baths</pl> called after him, a large circular theater, a building for horse-races which is actually two stades long, and the <pl id='Q478642'>Forum</pl> at <pl id='Q18287233'>Rome</pl>, worth seeing not only for its general beauty but especially for its roof made of bronze. </p>
<p id='5.12.7'><b>5.12.7</b> Of the statues set up in the round buildings, the amber one represents <prn id='Q1405'>Augustus</prn> the Roman emperor, the ivory one they told me was a portrait of <prn id='Q343604'>Nicomedes</prn>, king of <pl id='Q373189'>Bithynia</pl>. After him the greatest city in <pl id='Q373189'>Bithynia</pl> was renamed <pl id='Q209349'>Nicomedeia</pl>; before him it was called <pl id='Q4810504'>Astacus</pl>, and its first founder was <prn id='Q205468'>Zypoetes</prn>, a Thracian by birth to judge from his name. This amber of which the statue of <prn id='Q1405'>Augustus</prn> is made, when found native in the sand of the <pl id='Q643'>Eridanus</pl>, is very rare and precious to men for many reasons; the other “amber” is an alloy of gold and silver. </p>
<p id='5.12.8'><b>5.12.8</b> In the <pl id='Q197019'>temple</pl> at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> are four offerings of <prn id='Q1413'>Nero</prn> — three crowns representing wild-olive leaves, and one representing oak leaves. Here too are laid twenty-five bronze shields, which are for the armed men to carry in the race. Tablets too are set up, including one on which is written the oath sworn by the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> to the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> and the <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineans</pl>, that they would be their allies for a hundred years. </p>
<p id='5.13.1'><b>5.13.1</b> Within the <pl id='Q2400346'>Altis</pl> there is also a <pl id='Q7161678'>sacred enclosure</pl> consecrated to <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn>, whom the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> as much prefer in honor above the heroes of <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> as they prefer <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> over the other gods. To the right of the entrance of the <pl id='Q197019'>temple</pl> of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, on the north side, lies the <pl id='Q7161678'>Pelopium</pl>. It is far enough removed from the <pl id='Q197019'>temple</pl> for statues and other offerings to stand in the intervening space, and beginning at about the middle of the <pl id='Q197019'>temple</pl> it extends as far as the rear chamber. It is surrounded by a stone fence, within which trees grow and statues have been dedicated. </p>
<p id='5.13.2'><b>5.13.2</b> The entrance is on the west. The sanctuary is said to have been set apart to <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn> by <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> the son of <prn id='Q206214'>Amphitryon</prn>. <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> too was a great-grandson of <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn>, and he is also said to have sacrificed to him into the pit. Right down to the present day the magistrates of the year sacrifice to him, and the victim is a black ram. No portion of this sacrifice goes to the sooth-sayer, only the neck of the ram it is usual to give to the “woodman,” as he is called. </p>
<p id='5.13.3'><b>5.13.3</b> The woodman is one of the servants of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, and the task assigned to him is to supply cities and private individuals with wood for sacrifices at a fixed rate, wood of the white poplar, but of no other tree, being allowed. If anybody, whether <pl id='Q6536845'>Elean</pl> or stranger, eat of the meat of the victim sacrificed to <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn>, he may not enter the <pl id='Q197019'>temple</pl> of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>. The same rule applies to those who sacrifice to <prn id='Q916442'>Telephus</prn> at <pl id='Q18986'>Pergamus</pl> above the river <pl id='Q1737602'>Caicus</pl>; these too may not go up to the <pl id='Q630373'>Asclepeion</pl> before they have bathed. </p>
<p id='5.13.4'><b>5.13.4</b> The following tale too is told. When the war of the Greeks against <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl> was prolonged, the soothsayers prophesied to them that they would not take the city until they had fetched the bow and arrows of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> and a bone of <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn>. So it is said that they sent for <prn id='Q212827'>Philoctetes</prn> to the camp, and from <pl id='Q922329'>Pisa</pl> was brought to them a bone of <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn> — a <prn id='Q106798997'>shoulder-blade</prn>. As they were returning home, the ship carrying the bone of <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn> was wrecked off <pl id='Q173096'>Euboea</pl> in the storm. </p>
<p id='5.13.5'><b>5.13.5</b> Many years later than the capture of <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl>, <prn id='Q106798775'>Damarmenus</prn>, a fisherman from <pl id='Q16562724'>Eretria</pl>, cast a net into the sea and drew up the bone. Marvelling at its size he kept it hidden in the sand. At last he went to <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>, to inquire whose the bone was, and what he ought to do with it. </p>
<p id='5.13.6'><b>5.13.6</b> It happened that by the providence of Heaven there was then at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> an <pl id='Q6536845'>Elean</pl> embassy praying for deliverance from a pestilence. So the <prn id='Q220344'>Pythian priestess</prn> ordered the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> to recover the bones of <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn>, and <prn id='Q106798775'>Damarmenus</prn> to give back to the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> what he had found. He did so, and the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> repaid him by appointing him and his descendants to be guardians of the bone. The <prn id='Q106798997'>shoulder-blade</prn> of <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn> had disappeared by my time, because, I suppose, it had been hidden in the depths so long, and besides its age it was greatly decayed through the salt water. </p>
<p id='5.13.7'><b>5.13.7</b> That <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn> and <prn id='Q182101'>Tantalus</prn> once dwelt in my country there have remained signs right down to the present day. There is a lake called after <prn id='Q182101'>Tantalus</prn> and a famous grave, and on a peak of Mount <pl id='Q532698'>Sipylus</pl> there is a throne of <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn> beyond the sanctuary of Plastene the Mother. If you cross the river <pl id='Q1351474'>Hermus</pl> you see an image of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> in <pl id='Q376084'>Temnus</pl> made of a living myrtle-tree. It is a tradition among us that it was dedicated by <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn> when he was propitiating the goddess and asking for <prn id='Q328354'>Hippodameia</prn> to be his bride. </p>
<p id='5.13.8'><b>5.13.8</b> The altar of <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> is about equally distant from the <pl id='Q7161678'>Pelopium</pl> and the sanctuary of <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn>, but it is in front of both. Some say that it was built by <pl id='Q83659'>Idaean</pl> <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, others by the local heroes two generations later than <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>. It has been made from the ash of the thighs of the victims sacrificed to <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, as is also the altar at <pl id='Q18986'>Pergamus</pl>. There is an ashen altar of <pl id='Q841207'>Samian</pl> <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> not a bit grander than what in <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl> the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> call “improvised hearths.” </p>
<p id='5.13.9'><b>5.13.9</b> The first stage of the altar at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>, called prothysis, has a circumference of one hundred and twenty-five feet; the circumference of the stage on the prothysis is thirty-two feet; the total height of the altar reaches to twenty-two feet. The victims themselves it is the custom to sacrifice on the lower stage, the prothysis. But the thighs they carry up to the highest part of the altar and burn them there. </p>
<p id='5.13.10'><b>5.13.10</b> The steps that lead up to the prothysis from either side are made of stone, but those leading from the prothysis to the upper part of the altar are, like the altar itself, composed of ashes. The ascent to the prothysis may be made by maidens, and likewise by women, when they are not shut out from <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>, but men only can ascend from the prothysis to the highest part of the altar. Even when the festival is not being held, sacrifice is offered to <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> by private individuals and daily by the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>. </p>
<p id='5.13.11'><b>5.13.11</b> Every year the soothsayers, keeping carefully to the nineteenth day of the month <prn id='Q93474645'>Elaphius</prn>, bring the ash from the town-hall, and making it into a paste with the water of the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl> they daub the altar therewith. But never may the ash be made into paste with other water, and for this reason the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl> is thought to be of all rivers the dearest to <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>. There is also an altar at <pl id='Q671358'>Didyma</pl> of the <pl id='Q169460'>Milesians</pl>, which <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> the <pl id='Q11225429'>Theban</pl> is said by the <pl id='Q169460'>Milesians</pl> to have made from the blood of the victims. But in later times the blood of the sacrifices has not made the altar excessively large. </p>
<p id='5.14.1'><b>5.14.1</b> The altar at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> shows another strange peculiarity, which is this. The kite, the bird of prey with the most rapacious nature, never harms those who are sacrificing at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>. Should ever a kite seize the entrails or some of the flesh, it is regarded as an unfavorable sign for the sacrificer. There is a story that when <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> the son of <prn id='Q190543'>Alcmena</prn> was sacrificing at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> he was much worried by the flies. So either on his own initiative or at somebody's suggestion he sacrificed to <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q619619'>Apomyius</prn> (averter of flies), and thus the flies were diverted to the other side of the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl>. It is said that in the same way the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> too sacrifice to <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q619619'>Apomyius</prn>, to drive the flies out of <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>. </p>
<p id='5.14.2'><b>5.14.2</b> The <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> are wont to use for the sacrifices to <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> the wood of the white poplar and of no other tree, preferring the white poplar, I think, simply and solely because <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> brought it into Greece from <pl id='Q2551754'>Thesprotia</pl>. And it is my opinion that when <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> sacrificed to <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> he himself burned the thigh bones of the victims upon wood of the white poplar. <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> found the white poplar growing on the banks of the <pl id='Q191087'>Acheron</pl>, the river in <pl id='Q2551754'>Thesprotia</pl>, and for this reason <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> calls it “Acheroid.” </p>
<p id='5.14.3'><b>5.14.3</b> So from the first down to the present all rivers have not been equally suited for the growth of plants and trees. Tamarisks grow best and in the greatest numbers by the <pl id='Q211089'>Maeander</pl>; the <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotian</pl> <pl id='Q2737429'>Asopus</pl> can produce the tallest reeds; the persea tree flourishes only in the water of the <pl id='Q3392'>Nile</pl>. So it is no wonder that the white poplar grew first by the <pl id='Q191087'>Acheron</pl> and the wild olive by the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl>, and that the dark poplar is a nursling of the <pl id='Q35966'>Celtic</pl> land of the <pl id='Q35966'>Celtic</pl> <pl id='Q643'>Eridanus</pl>. </p>
<p id='5.14.4'><b>5.14.4</b> Now that I have finished my account of the greatest altar, let me proceed to describe all the altars in <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>. My narrative will follow in dealing with them the order in which the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> are wont to sacrifice on the altars. They sacrifice to <prn id='Q41419'>Hestia</prn> first, secondly to <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, going to the altar within the <pl id='Q197019'>temple</pl>, thirdly to <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q1805711'>Laoetas</prn> and to <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> <prn id='Q1805711'>Laoetas</prn>. This sacrifice too it is usual to offer on one altar. </p>
<p id='5.14.5'><b>5.14.5</b> Fourthly and fifthly they sacrifice to <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> and to <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> <prn id='Q107264268'>Leitis</prn> (of Booty), sixthly to <prn id='Q1350313'>Ergane</prn> (Worker). The descendants of <prn id='Q177302'>Pheidias</prn>, called Cleansers (Phaidryntai), have received from the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> the privilege of cleaning the image of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> from the dirt that settles on it, and they sacrifice to this <prn id='Q1350313'>Ergane</prn> before they begin to polish the image. There is another altar of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> near the <pl id='Q197019'>temple</pl>, and by it a square altar of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> rising gently to a height. </p>
<p id='5.14.6'><b>5.14.6</b> After the altars I have enumerated there is one on which they sacrifice to <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl> and <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> together. The cause of this <prn id='Q134929'>Pindar</prn>, I think, intimates in an ode, and I give it in my account of <pl id='Q12880141'>Letrini</pl>. Not far from it stands another altar of <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl>, and by it one of <prn id='Q44384'>Hephaestus</prn>. This altar of <prn id='Q44384'>Hephaestus</prn> some <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> call the altar of Areios (warlike) <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>. These same <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> also say that <prn id='Q847890'>Oenomaus</prn> used to sacrifice to <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> Areios on this altar whenever he was about to begin a chariot-race with one of the suitors of <prn id='Q328354'>Hippodameia</prn>. </p>
<p id='5.14.7'><b>5.14.7</b> After this stands an altar of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> surnamed <prn id='Q107040833'>Parastates</prn> (Assistant); there are also altars of the brothers of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> — <prn id='Q1347121'>Epimedes</prn>, <prn id='Q106804079'>Idas</prn>, <prn id='Q1639138'>Paeonaeus</prn>, and <prn id='Q106803870'>Iasus</prn>; I am aware, however, that the altar of <prn id='Q106804079'>Idas</prn> is called by others the altar of <prn id='Q3604254'>Acesidas</prn>. At the place where are the foundations of the house of <prn id='Q847890'>Oenomaus</prn> stand two altars: one is of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q103020456'>Herkeios</prn>, which <prn id='Q847890'>Oenomaus</prn> appears to have had built himself, and the other of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q107264533'>Keraunios</prn> (of the Thunderbolt), which I believe they built later, when the thunderbolt had struck the house of <prn id='Q847890'>Oenomaus</prn>. </p>
<p id='5.14.8'><b>5.14.8</b> An account of the great altar I gave a little way back; it is called the altar of <prn id='Q106460486'>Olympian</prn> <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>. By it is an altar of Unknown Gods, and after this an altar of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q57026643'>Katharsios</prn> (purifier), one of <prn id='Q165023'>Nike</prn>, and another of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> — this time surnamed <prn id='Q57446061'>Chthonian</prn>. There are also altars of all gods, and of <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> surnamed <prn id='Q106460486'>Olympian</prn>, this too being made of ashes. They say that it was dedicated by <prn id='Q16663935'>Clymenus</prn>. After this comes an altar of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> and <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> in common, because the Greeks have a story about them that <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> invented the lyre and <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> the lute. </p>
<p id='5.14.9'><b>5.14.9</b> Next come an altar of <prn id='Q5891490'>Homonoia</prn> (concord), another of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, and the altar of the <prn id='Q334486'>Mother</prn> of the gods. Quite close to the entrance to the <pl id='Q4357227'>stadium</pl> are two altars; one they call the altar of <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> Enagonios (of the Games), the other the altar of <prn id='Q845756'>Kairos</prn> (opportunity). I know that a hymn to <prn id='Q845756'>Kairos</prn> is one of the poems of <prn id='Q162163'>Ion</prn> of <pl id='Q748832'>Chios</pl>; in the hymn <prn id='Q845756'>Kairos</prn> is made out to be the youngest child of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>. Near the <pl id='Q7836783'>treasury</pl> of the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl> is an altar of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, either one of the <prn id='Q247617'>Curetes</prn> or the son of <prn id='Q190543'>Alcmena</prn>, for both accounts are given. </p>
<p id='5.14.10'><b>5.14.10</b> On what is called the Gaeum (sanctuary of <prn id='Q93172'>Earth</prn>) is an altar of <prn id='Q93172'>Earth</prn>; it too is of ashes. In more ancient days they say that there was an oracle also of <prn id='Q93172'>Earth</prn> in this place. On what is called the Stomium (Mouth) the altar to <prn id='Q159168'>Themis</prn> has been built. All round the altar of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> Descender runs a fence; this altar is near the great altar made of the ashes. The reader must remember that the altars have not been enumerated in the order in which they stand, but the order followed by my narrative is that followed by the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> in their sacrifices. By the sacred enclosure of <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn> is an altar of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> and the <prn id='Q184353'>Graces</prn> in common; between them is an altar of the <prn id='Q66016'>Muses</prn>, and next to these an altar of the <prn id='Q373916'>Nymphs</prn>. </p>
<p id='5.15.1'><b>5.15.1</b> Outside the <pl id='Q2400346'>Altis</pl> there is a building called the <pl id='Q23889060'>workshop</pl> of <prn id='Q177302'>Pheidias</prn>, where he wrought the <prn id='Q46239'>image</prn> of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> piece by piece. In the building is an altar to all the gods in common. Now return back again to the <pl id='Q2400346'>Altis</pl> opposite the <pl id='Q3271682'>Leonidaeum</pl>. </p>
<p id='5.15.2'><b>5.15.2</b> The <pl id='Q3271682'>Leonidaeum</pl> is outside the sacred enclosure, but at the processional entrance to the <pl id='Q2400346'>Altis</pl>, which is the only way open to those who take part in the processions. It was dedicated by LeonidasYY, a native, but in my time the Roman governors of Greece used it as their lodging. Between the processional entrance and the <pl id='Q3271682'>Leonidaeum</pl> is a street, for the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> call streets what the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> call lanes. </p>
<p id='5.15.3'><b>5.15.3</b> Well, there is in the <pl id='Q2400346'>Altis</pl>, when you are about to pass to the left of the <pl id='Q3271682'>Leonidaeum</pl>, an altar of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>, and after it one of the <prn id='Q201411'>Seasons</prn>. About opposite the rear chamber a wild olive is growing on the right. It is called the olive of the Beautiful Crown, and from its leaves are made the crowns which it is customary to give to winners of <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> contests. Near this wild olive stands an altar of <prn id='Q373916'>Nymphs</prn>; these too are styled <prn id='Q373916'>Nymphs</prn> of the Beautiful Crowns. </p>
<p id='5.15.4'><b>5.15.4</b> Outside the <pl id='Q2400346'>Altis</pl>, but on the right of the <pl id='Q3271682'>Leonidaeum</pl>, is an altar of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> <prn id='Q4693579'>Agoraea</prn>, and one has also been built for Mistresses, and in my account of <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl> I will tell you about the goddess they call <prn id='Q1146978'>Despoina</prn> (Mistress). After this is an altar of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q4693579'>Agoraeus</prn>, and before what is called the Front Seats stands an altar of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> surnamed <pl id='Q682558'>Pythian</pl>, and after it one of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>. The last altar is said to be not old, and to have been dedicated by private individuals. </p>
<p id='5.15.5'><b>5.15.5</b> As you go to the starting-point for the chariot-race there is an altar with an inscription “to the Moiragetes (bringer of fate).” This is plainly a surname of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, who knows the affairs of men, all that the <prn id='Q180287'>Fates</prn> give them, and all that is not destined for them. Near there is also an oblong altar of <prn id='Q180287'>Fates</prn>, after it one of <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn>, and the next two are of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> Most High. At the starting-point for the chariot-race, just about opposite the middle of it, there are in the open altars of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> <prn id='Q20100719'>Hippios</prn> and <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> <prn id='Q20100719'>Hippia</prn>, and near the pillar an altar of the <prn id='Q190103'>Dioscuri</prn>. </p>
<p id='5.15.6'><b>5.15.6</b> At the entrance to what is called the Wedge there is on one side an altar of <prn id='Q40901'>Ares</prn> <prn id='Q20100719'>Hippios</prn>, on the other one of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> <prn id='Q20100719'>Horse-goddess</prn>. On entering the Wedge itself you see altars of <prn id='Q106990053'>Agathe Tyche</prn> (good fortune), <prn id='Q132582'>Pan</prn> and <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>; at the innermost part of the Wedge an altar of the <prn id='Q373916'>Nymphs</prn> called <prn id='Q12873241'>Acmenes</prn> (Blooming). An altar of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> stands on the right as you return from the stoa that the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> call the Stoa of <prn id='Q394350'>Agnaptus</prn>, giving to the building the name of its architect. </p>
<p id='5.15.7'><b>5.15.7</b> After re-entering the <pl id='Q2400346'>Altis</pl> by the processional gate there are behind the <pl id='Q633572'>Heraeum</pl> altars of the river <pl id='Q647970'>Cladeus</pl> and of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>; the one after them is <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>'s, the fourth is of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> surnamed <prn id='Q1778938'>Coccoca</prn>, and the fifth is of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> <prn id='Q107270839'>Thermius</prn>. As to the <pl id='Q6536845'>Elean</pl> surname <prn id='Q107270839'>Thermius</prn>, the conjecture occurred to me that in the <pl id='Q122443'>Attic</pl> dialect it would be thesmios (god of laws), but why <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> is surnamed <prn id='Q1778938'>Coccoca</prn> I could not discover. </p>
<p id='5.15.8'><b>5.15.8</b> Before what is called the <PRN id='Q23859825'>Theêcoleon</PRN> is a building, in a corner of which has been set up an altar of <prn id='Q132582'>Pan</prn>. The <pl id='Q23889050'>Prytaneum</pl> of the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> is within the <pl id='Q2400346'>Altis</pl>, and it has been built beside the exit beyond the <pl id='Q25535896'>gymnasium</pl>. In this <pl id='Q25535896'>gymnasium</pl> are the running-tracks and the wrestling-grounds for the athletes. In front of the door of the <pl id='Q23889050'>Prytaneum</pl> is an altar of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> <prn id='Q1458788'>Agrotera</prn> </p>
<p id='5.15.9'><b>5.15.9</b> In the <pl id='Q23889050'>Prytaneum</pl> itself, on the right as you enter the room where they have the hearth, is an altar of <prn id='Q132582'>Pan</prn>. This hearth too is made of ashes, and on it fire burns every day and likewise every night. The ashes from this hearth, according to the account I have already given, they bring to the altar of <prn id='Q106460486'>Olympian</prn> <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, and what is brought from the hearth contributes a great deal to the size of the altar. </p>
<p id='5.15.10'><b>5.15.10</b> Each month the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> sacrifice once on all the altars I have enumerated. They sacrifice in an ancient manner; for they burn on the altars incense with wheat which has been kneaded with honey, placing also on the altars twigs of olive, and using wine for a libation. Only to the <prn id='Q373916'>Nymphs</prn> and the Mistresses are they not wont to pour wine in libation, nor do they pour it on the altar common to all the gods. The care of the sacrifices is given to a priest, holding office for one month, to soothsayers and libation-bearers, and also to a guide, a flute-player and the woodman. </p>
<p id='5.15.11'><b>5.15.11</b> The traditional words spoken by them in the <pl id='Q23889050'>Prytaneum</pl> at the libations, and the hymns which they sing, it were not right for me to introduce into my narrative. They pour libations, not only to the Greek gods, but also to the god in <pl id='Q2370577'>Libya</pl>, to <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> <prn id='Q5732464'>Ammonia</prn> and to <prn id='Q107264650'>Parammon</prn>, which is a surname of <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn>. From very early times it is plain that they used the <pl id='Q958997'>oracle</pl> in <pl id='Q2370577'>Libya</pl>, and in the temple of <prn id='Q3575327'>Ammon</prn> are altars which the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> dedicated. On them are engraved the questions of the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>, the replies of the god, and the names of the men who came to <prn id='Q3575327'>Ammon</prn> from <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>. These are in the temple of <prn id='Q3575327'>Ammon</prn>. </p>
<p id='5.15.12'><b>5.15.12</b> The <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> also pour libations to all heroes and wives of heroes who are honored either in <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> or among the <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolians</pl>. The songs sung in the <pl id='Q23889050'>Prytaneum</pl> are in the <prn id='Q285494'>Doric</prn> dialect, but they do not say who it was that composed them. The <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> also have a banqueting room. This too is in the <pl id='Q23889050'>Prytaneum</pl>, opposite the chamber where stands the hearth. In this room they entertain the winners in the <prn id='Q188468'>Olympic games</prn>. </p>
<p id='5.16.1'><b>5.16.1</b> It remains after this for me to describe the <pl id='Q633572'>temple</pl> of <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> and the noteworthy objects contained in it. The <pl id='Q6536845'>Elean</pl> account says that it was the people of <pl id='Q733291'>Scillus</pl>, one of the cities in <pl id='Q472032'>Triphylia</pl>, who built the <pl id='Q633572'>temple</pl> about eight years after <prn id='Q575252'>Oxylus</prn> came to the throne of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>. The style of the <pl id='Q633572'>temple</pl> is <prn id='Q192664'>Doric</prn>, and pillars stand all round it. In the rear chamber one of the two pillars is of oak. The length of the <pl id='Q633572'>temple</pl> is one hundred and sixty-nine feet, the breadth sixty-three feet, the height not short of fifty feet. Who the architect was they do not relate. </p>
<p id='5.16.2'><b>5.16.2</b> Every fourth year there is woven for <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> a robe by the Sixteen women, and the same also hold games called <prn id='Q605458'>Heraea</prn>. The games consist of foot-races for maidens. These are not all of the same age. The first to run are the youngest; after them come the next in age, and the last to run are the oldest of the maidens. They run in the following way: </p>
<p id='5.16.3'><b>5.16.3</b> their hair hangs down, a tunic reaches to a little above the knee, and they bare the right shoulder as far as the breast. These too have the <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> <pl id='Q4357227'>stadium</pl> reserved for their games, but the course of the <pl id='Q4357227'>stadium</pl> is shortened for them by about one-sixth of its length. To the winning maidens they give crowns of olive and a portion of the <prn id='Q830'>cow</prn> sacrificed to <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn>. They may also dedicate statues with their names inscribed upon them. Those who administer to the Sixteen are, like the presidents of the games, married women. </p>
<p id='5.16.4'><b>5.16.4</b> The games of the maidens too are traced back to ancient times; they say that, out of gratitude to <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> for her marriage with <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn>, <prn id='Q328354'>Hippodameia</prn> assembled the <prn id='Q7533071'>Sixteen Women</prn>, and with them inaugurated the <prn id='Q605458'>Heraea</prn>. They relate too that a victory was won by <prn id='Q28122362'>Chloris</prn>, the only surviving daughter of the house of <prn id='Q242835'>Amphion</prn>, though with her they say survived one of her brothers. As to the children of <prn id='Q213621'>Niobe</prn>, what I myself chanced to learn about them I have set forth in my account of <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>. </p>
<p id='5.16.5'><b>5.16.5</b> Besides the account already given they tell another story about the <prn id='Q7533071'>Sixteen Women</prn> as follows. <prn id='Q1158742'>Damophon</prn>, it is said, when tyrant of <pl id='Q922329'>Pisa</pl> did much grievous harm to the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>. But when he died, since the people of <pl id='Q922329'>Pisa</pl> refused to participate as a people in their tyrant's sins, and the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> too became quite ready to lay aside their grievances, they chose a woman from each of the sixteen cities of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> still inhabited at that time to settle their differences, this woman to be the oldest, the most noble, and the most esteemed of all the women. </p>
<p id='5.16.6'><b>5.16.6</b> The cities from which they chose the women were <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>, . . . The women from these cities made peace between <pl id='Q922329'>Pisa</pl> and <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>. Later on they were entrusted with the management of the <prn id='Q605458'>Heraean</prn> games, and with the weaving of the robe for <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn>. The <prn id='Q7533071'>Sixteen Women</prn> also arrange two choral dances, one called that of <prn id='Q16332252'>Physcoa</prn> and the other that of <prn id='Q328354'>Hippodameia</prn>. This <prn id='Q16332252'>Physcoa</prn> they say came from <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> in the Hollow, and the name of the deme where she lived was OrthiaYY. </p>
<p id='5.16.7'><b>5.16.7</b> She mated they say with <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>, and bore him a son called <prn id='Q16330183'>Narcaeus</prn>. When he grew up he made war against the neighboring folk, and rose to great power, setting up moreover a sanctuary of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> surnamed <prn id='Q107264674'>Narcaea</prn>. They say too that <prn id='Q16330183'>Narcaeus</prn> and <prn id='Q16332252'>Physcoa</prn> were the first to pay worship to <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>. So various honors are paid to <prn id='Q16332252'>Physcoa</prn>, especially that of the choral dance, named after her and managed by the <prn id='Q7533071'>Sixteen Women</prn>. The <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> still adhere to the other ancient customs, even though some of the cities have been destroyed. For they are now divided into eight tribes, and they choose two women from each. </p>
<p id='5.16.8'><b>5.16.8</b> Whatever ritual it is the duty of either the <prn id='Q7533071'>Sixteen Women</prn> or the <pl id='Q6536845'>Elean</pl> umpires to perform, they do not perform before they have purified themselves with a pig meet for purification and with water. Their purification takes place at the spring Piera. You reach this spring as you go along the flat road from <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> to <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>. </p>
<p id='5.17.1'><b>5.17.1</b> These things, then, are as I have already described. In the <pl id='Q633572'>temple</pl> of <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> is an image of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, and the image of <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> is sitting on a throne with <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> standing by her, bearded and with a helmet on his head. They are crude works of art. The figures of <prn id='Q201411'>Seasons</prn> next to them, seated upon thrones, were made by the <pl id='Q191082'>Aeginetan</pl> <prn id='Q3963012'>Smilis</prn>. Beside them stands an image of <prn id='Q159168'>Themis</prn>, as being mother of the <prn id='Q201411'>Seasons</prn>. It is the work of <prn id='Q11917714'>Dorycleidas</prn>, a <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> by birth and a disciple of <prn id='Q15806048'>Dipoenus</prn> and <prn id='Q19999327'>Scyllis</prn>. </p>
<p id='5.17.2'><b>5.17.2</b> The <prn id='Q206187'>Hesperides</prn>, five in number, were made by <prn id='Q11951483'>Theocles</prn>, who like <prn id='Q11917714'>Dorycleidas</prn> was a <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl>, the son of Hegylus; he too, they say, was a student under <prn id='Q19999327'>Scyllis</prn> and <prn id='Q15806048'>Dipoenus</prn>. The <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> wearing a helmet and carrying a spear and shield is, it is said, a work of <prn id='Q1175368'>Medon</prn>, a <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl>, brother of <prn id='Q11917714'>Dorycleidas</prn> and a pupil of the same masters. </p>
<p id='5.17.3'><b>5.17.3</b> Then <prn id='Q45967'>Kore</prn> and <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> sit opposite each other, while <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> and <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> stand opposite each other. Here too have been dedicated <prn id='Q103107'>Leto</prn>, <prn id='Q213440'>Fortune</prn>, <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> and a winged <prn id='Q165023'>Victory</prn>. I cannot say who the artists were, but these figures too are in my opinion very ancient. The figures I have enumerated are of ivory and gold, but at a later date other images were dedicated in the <pl id='Q633572'>Heraeum</pl>, including a marble <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> carrying the baby <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>, a <prn id='Q1518432'>work</prn> of <prn id='Q105290'>Praxiteles</prn>, and a bronze <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> made by <prn id='Q5131686'>Cleon</prn> of <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl>. </p>
<p id='5.17.4'><b>5.17.4</b> The master of this <prn id='Q5131686'>Cleon</prn>, called <prn id='Q4775095'>Antiphanes</prn>, was a pupil of <prn id='Q7168407'>Periclytus</prn>, who himself was a pupil of <prn id='Q193422'>Polycleitus</prn> of <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>. A nude gilded child is seated before <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>, a work fashioned by <prn id='Q890332'>Boethus</prn> of <pl id='Q337381'>Calchedon</pl>. There were also brought hither from what is called the <pl id='Q3396766'>Philippeum</pl> other images of gold and ivory, <prn id='Q292317'>Eurydice</prn> the wife of <prn id='Q295530'>Aridaeus</prn> and <prn id='Q223134'>Olympias</prn> the wife of <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn>. </p>
<p id='5.17.5'><b>5.17.5</b> There is also a chest made of cedar, with figures on it, some of ivory, some of gold, others carved out of the cedar-wood itself. It was in this chest that <prn id='Q430688'>Cypselus</prn>, the tyrant of <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl>, was hidden by his mother when the <prn id='Q804277'>Bacchidae</prn> were anxious to discover him after his birth. In gratitude for the saving of <prn id='Q430688'>Cypselus</prn>, his descendants, <prn id='Q1478391'>Cypselids</prn> as they are called, dedicated the chest at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>. The <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthians</pl> of that age called chests kypselai, and from this word, they say, the child received his name of <prn id='Q430688'>Cypselus</prn>. </p>
<p id='5.17.6'><b>5.17.6</b> On most of the figures on the chest there are inscriptions, written in the ancient characters. In some cases the letters read straight on, but in others the form of the writing is what the Greeks call bustrophedon. It is like this: at the end of the line the second line turns back, as runners do when running the double race. Moreover the inscriptions on the chest are written in winding characters difficult to decipher. Beginning our survey at the bottom we see in the first space of the chest the following scenes. </p>
<p id='5.17.7'><b>5.17.7</b> <prn id='Q847890'>Oenomaus</prn> is chasing <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn>, who is holding <prn id='Q328354'>Hippodameia</prn>. Each of them has two <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn>, but those of <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn> have wings. Next is wrought the house of <prn id='Q330584'>Amphiaraus</prn>, and baby <prn id='Q474888'>Amphilochus</prn> is being carried by some old woman or other. In front of the house stands <prn id='Q1125040'>Eriphyle</prn> with the necklace, and by her are her daughters <prn id='Q1317369'>Eurydice</prn> and <prn id='Q10265000'>Demonassa</prn>, and the boy <prn id='Q591089'>Alcmaeon</prn> naked. </p>
<p id='5.17.8'><b>5.17.8</b> <prn id='Q730625'>Asius</prn> in his poem makes out <prn id='Q190543'>Alcmena</prn> also to be a daughter of <prn id='Q330584'>Amphiaraus</prn> and <prn id='Q1125040'>Eriphyle</prn>. <prn id='Q3636218'>Baton</prn> is driving the chariot of <prn id='Q330584'>Amphiaraus</prn>, holding the reins in one hand and a spear in the other. <prn id='Q330584'>Amphiaraus</prn> already has one foot on the chariot and his sword drawn; he is turned towards <prn id='Q1125040'>Eriphyle</prn> in such a transport of anger that he can scarcely refrain from striking her. </p>
<p id='5.17.9'><b>5.17.9</b> After the house of <prn id='Q330584'>Amphiaraus</prn> come the games at the funeral of <prn id='Q182439'>Pelias</prn>, with the spectators looking at the competitors. <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> is seated on a throne, and behind him is a woman. There is no inscription saying who the woman is, but she is playing on a <pl id='Q32579'>Phrygian</pl>, not a Greek, flute. Driving chariots drawn by pairs of <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn> are <prn id='Q12882571'>Pisus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q342343'>Perieres</prn>, and <prn id='Q24055357'>Asterion</prn>, son of <prn id='Q58494141'>Cometas</prn> (<prn id='Q24055357'>Asterion</prn> is said to have been one of the <prn id='Q165510'>Argonauts</prn>), <prn id='Q190103'>Polydeuces</prn>, <prn id='Q192109'>Admetus</prn> and <prn id='Q749123'>Euphemus</prn>. The poets declare that the last was a son of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> and a companion of <prn id='Q176758'>Jason</prn> on his voyage to <pl id='Q183150'>Colchis</pl>. He it is who is winning the chariot-race. </p>
<p id='5.17.10'><b>5.17.10</b> Those who have boldly ventured to box are <prn id='Q192109'>Admetus</prn> and <prn id='Q492938'>Mopsus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q16488015'>Ampyx</prn>. Between them stands a man playing the flute, as in our day they are accustomed to play the flute when the competitors in the pentathlum are jumping. The wrestling-bout between <prn id='Q176758'>Jason</prn> and <prn id='Q178641'>Peleus</prn> is an even one. Eurybotas1 is shown throwing the quoit; he must be some famous quoit-thrower. Those engaged in a running-race are <prn id='Q1455747'>Melanion</prn>, Neotheus and Phalareus; the fourth runner is A302;A303, and the fifth is <prn id='Q1525379'>Iphiclus</prn>. <prn id='Q1525379'>Iphiclus</prn> is the winner, and <prn id='Q416384'>Acastus</prn> is holding out the crown to him. He is probably the father of the <prn id='Q871361'>Protesilaus</prn> who joined in the war against <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl>. </p>
<p id='5.17.11'><b>5.17.11</b> Tripods too are set here, prizes of course for the winners; and there are the daughters of <prn id='Q182439'>Pelias</prn>, though the only one with her name inscribed is <prn id='Q320449'>Alcestis</prn>. <prn id='Q504076'>Iolaus</prn>, who voluntarily helped <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> in his labours, is shown as a victor in the chariot-race. At this point the funeral games of <prn id='Q182439'>Pelias</prn> come to an end, and <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, with <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> standing beside him, is shooting at the <prn id='Q170379'>Hydra</prn>, the beast in the river <prn id='Q482096'>Amymone</prn>. <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> can be easily recognized by his exploit and his attitude, so his name is not inscribed by him. There is also <prn id='Q641065'>Phineus</prn> the Thracian, and the sons of <prn id='Q109220'>Boreas</prn> are chasing the harpies away from him. </p>
<p id='5.18.1'><b>5.18.1</b> Now I come to the second space on the chest, and in going round it I had better begin from the left. There is a figure of a woman holding on her right arm a white child asleep, and on her left she has a black child like one who is asleep. Each has his feet turned different ways. The inscriptions declare, as one could infer without inscriptions, that the figures are <prn id='Q199647'>Death</prn> and <prn id='Q189347'>Sleep</prn>, with <prn id='Q131203'>Night</prn> the nurse of both. </p>
<p id='5.18.2'><b>5.18.2</b> A beautiful woman is punishing an ugly one, choking her with one hand and with the other striking her with a staff. It is <prn id='Q465875'>Justice</prn> who thus treats Injustice. Two other women are pounding in mortars with pestles; they are supposed to be wise in medicine-lore, though there is no inscription to them. Who the man is who is followed by a woman is made plain by the hexameter verses, which run thus: “<prn id='Q1136130'>Idas</prn> brings back, not against her will, Fair-ankled <prn id='Q932325'>Marpessa</prn>, daughter of <prn id='Q1372323'>Evenus</prn>, whom <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> carried off.” </p>
<p id='5.18.3'><b>5.18.3</b> A man wearing a tunic is holding in his right hand a cup, and in his left a necklace; <prn id='Q190543'>Alcmena</prn> is taking hold of them. This scene represents the Greek story how <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> in the likeness of <prn id='Q206214'>Amphitryon</prn> had intercourse with <prn id='Q190543'>Alcmena</prn>. <prn id='Q171839'>Menelaus</prn>, wearing a breastplate and carrying a sword, is advancing to kill <prn id='Q164061'>Helen</prn>, so it is plain that <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl> has been captured. <prn id='Q174278'>Medeia</prn> is seated upon a throne, while <prn id='Q176758'>Jason</prn> stands on her right and <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> on her left. On them is an inscription: “<prn id='Q176758'>Jason</prn> weds <prn id='Q174278'>Medeia</prn>, as <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> bids. </p>
<p id='5.18.4'><b>5.18.4</b> There are also figures of <prn id='Q66016'>Muses</prn> singing, with <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> leading the song; these too have an inscription: <br>“This is <prn id='Q103107'>Leto</prn>'s son, prince <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, far-shooting; <br>Around him are the <prn id='Q66016'>Muses</prn>, a graceful choir, whom he is leading. <br><prn id='Q130818'>Atlas</prn> too is supporting, just as the story has it, heaven and earth upon his shoulders; he is also carrying the apples of the <prn id='Q206187'>Hesperides</prn>. A man holding a sword is coming towards <prn id='Q130818'>Atlas</prn>. This everybody can see is <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, though he is not mentioned specially in the inscription, which reads: “Here is <prn id='Q130818'>Atlas</prn> holding heaven, but he will let go the apples. </p>
<p id='5.18.5'><b>5.18.5</b> There is also <prn id='Q40901'>Ares</prn> clad in armour and leading <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>. The inscription by him is “<prn id='Q1345963'>Enyalius</prn>.” There is also a figure of <prn id='Q184437'>Thetis</prn> as a maid; <prn id='Q178641'>Peleus</prn> is taking hold of her, and from the hand of <prn id='Q184437'>Thetis</prn> a <prn id='Q2102'>snake</prn> is darting at <prn id='Q178641'>Peleus</prn>. The sisters of <prn id='Q160730'>Medusa</prn>, with wings, are chasing <prn id='Q130832'>Perseus</prn>, who is flying. Only <prn id='Q130832'>Perseus</prn> has his name inscribed on him. </p>
<p id='5.18.6'><b>5.18.6</b> On the third space of the chest are military scenes. The greater number of the figures are on foot, though there are some knights in two-horse chariots. About the soldiers one may infer that they are advancing to battle, but that they will recognize and greet each other. Two different accounts of them are given by the guides. Some have said that they are the <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolians</pl> with <prn id='Q575252'>Oxylus</prn> and the ancient <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>, and that they are meeting in remembrance of their original descent and as a sign of their mutual good will. Others declare that the soldiers are meeting in battle, and that they are <pl id='Q7263101'>Pylians</pl> and <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> about to fight by the city <pl id='Q3563531'>Pheia</pl> and the river A923. </p>
<p id='5.18.7'><b>5.18.7</b> But it cannot for a moment be admitted that the ancestor of <prn id='Q430688'>Cypselus</prn>, a <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthian</pl>, having the chest made as a possession for himself, of his own accord passed over all <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthian</pl> story, and had carved on the chest foreign events which were not famous. The following interpretation suggested itself to me. <prn id='Q430688'>Cypselus</prn> and his ancestors came originally from <pl id='Q5582063'>Gonussa</pl> above <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl>, and one of their ancestors was <prn id='Q123191301'>Melas</prn>, the son of Antasus. </p>
<p id='5.18.8'><b>5.18.8</b> But, as I have already related in my account of <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl>, <prn id='Q603937'>Aletes</prn> refused to admit as settlers <prn id='Q123191301'>Melas</prn> and the host with him, being nervous about an oracle which had been given him from <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>; but at last <prn id='Q123191301'>Melas</prn>, using every art of winning favours, and returning with entreaties every time he was driven away, persuaded <prn id='Q603937'>Aletes</prn> however reluctantly to receive them. One might infer that this army is represented by the figures wrought upon the chest. </p>
<p id='5.19.1'><b>5.19.1</b> In the fourth space on the chest as you go round from the left is <prn id='Q109220'>Boreas</prn>, who has carried off <prn id='Q1129489'>Oreithyia</prn>; instead of feet he has <prn id='Q2102'>serpents</prn>' tails. Then comes the combat between <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> and <prn id='Q86805'>Geryones</prn>, who is represented as three men joined to one another. There is <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> holding a lyre, and by his side is <prn id='Q184874'>Ariadne</prn> gripping a crown. <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn> and <prn id='Q506781'>Memnon</prn> are fighting; their mothers stand by their side. </p>
<p id='5.19.2'><b>5.19.2</b> There is also <prn id='Q1455747'>Melanion</prn> by whom is <prn id='Q190323'>Atalanta</prn> holding a young deer. <prn id='Q172725'>Ajax</prn> is fighting a duel with <prn id='Q159666'>Hector</prn>, according to the challenge, and between the pair stands <prn id='Q140001'>Strife</prn> in the form of a most repulsive woman. Another figure of <prn id='Q140001'>Strife</prn> is in the sanctuary of <pl id='Q47611'>Ephesian</pl> <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>; <prn id='Q718124'>Calliphon</prn> of <pl id='Q13580795'>Samos</pl> included it in his picture of the battle at the ships of the Greeks. On the chest are also the <prn id='Q190103'>Dioscuri</prn>, one of them a beardless youth, and between them is <prn id='Q164061'>Helen</prn>. </p>
<p id='5.19.3'><b>5.19.3</b> <prn id='Q11921121'>Aethra</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q750580'>Pittheus</prn>, lies thrown to the ground under the feet at <prn id='Q164061'>Helen</prn>. She is clothed in black, and the inscription upon the group is an hexameter line with the addition of a single word: “The sons of <prn id='Q192946'>Tyndareus</prn> are carrying off <prn id='Q164061'>Helen</prn>, and are dragging <prn id='Q11921121'>Aethra</prn> from <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>. </p>
<p id='5.19.4'><b>5.19.4</b> Such is the way this line is constructed. <prn id='Q2497780'>Iphidamas</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q571969'>Antenor</prn>, is lying, and <prn id='Q1173681'>Coon</prn> is fighting for him against <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn>. On the shield of <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn> is Fear, whose head is a <prn id='Q140'>lion</prn>'s. The inscription above the corpse of <prn id='Q2497780'>Iphidamas</prn> runs: “<prn id='Q2497780'>Iphidamas</prn>, and this is <prn id='Q1173681'>Coon</prn> fighting for him.” The inscription on the shield of <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn> runs: </p>
<p id='5.19.5'><b>5.19.5</b> This is the Fear of mortals: he who holds him is <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn>.” There is also <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> bringing to <prn id='Q167646'>Alexander</prn> the son of <prn id='Q170473'>Priam</prn> the goddesses of whose beauty he is to judge, the inscription on them being: “Here is <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn>, who is showing to <prn id='Q167646'>Alexander</prn>, that he may arbitrate Concerning their beauty, <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn>, <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> and <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>.” On what account <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> has wings on her shoulders I do not know; in her right hand she grips a leopard, in her left a <prn id='Q140'>lion</prn>. <prn id='Q242319'>Ajax</prn> too is represented dragging <prn id='Q170779'>Cassandra</prn> from the image of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, and by him is also an inscription: “<prn id='Q242319'>Ajax</prn> of <pl id='Q3354839'>Locris</pl> is dragging <prn id='Q170779'>Cassandra</prn> from <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>.” </p>
<p id='5.19.6'><b>5.19.6</b> <prn id='Q334817'>Polyneices</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q130890'>Oedipus</prn>, has fallen on his knee, and <prn id='Q506550'>Eteocles</prn>, the other son of <prn id='Q130890'>Oedipus</prn>, is rushing on him. Behind <prn id='Q334817'>Polyneices</prn> stands a woman with teeth as cruel as those of a beast, and her fingernails are bent like talons. An inscription by her calls her Doom (Ker), implying that <prn id='Q334817'>Polyneices</prn> has been carried off by fate, and that <prn id='Q506550'>Eteocles</prn> fully deserved his end. <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> is lying down in a cave, a bearded figure holding a golden cup, and clad in a tunic reaching to the feet. Around him are vines, apple-trees and pomegranate-trees. </p>
<p id='5.19.7'><b>5.19.7</b> The highest space — the spaces are five in number — shows no inscription, so that we can only conjecture what the reliefs mean. Well, there is a grotto and in it a woman sleeping with a man upon a couch. I was of opinion that they were <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn> and <prn id='Q187602'>Circe</prn>, basing my view upon the number of the handmaidens in front of the grotto and upon what they are doing. For the women are four, and they are engaged on the tasks which <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> mentions in his poetry. There is a <prn id='Q83203'>Centaur</prn> with only two of his legs those of a <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn>; his forelegs are human. </p>
<p id='5.19.8'><b>5.19.8</b> Next come two-horse chariots with women standing in them. The <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn> have golden wings, and a man is giving armour to one of the women. I conjecture that this scene refers to the death of <prn id='Q186271'>Patroclus</prn>; the women in the chariots, I take it, are <prn id='Q54230'>Nereids</prn>, and <prn id='Q184437'>Thetis</prn> is receiving the armour from <prn id='Q44384'>Hephaestus</prn>. And moreover, he who is giving the armour is not strong upon his feet, and a slave follows him behind, holding a pair of fire-tongs. </p>
<p id='5.19.9'><b>5.19.9</b> An account also is given of the <prn id='Q83203'>Centaur</prn>, that he is <prn id='Q183417'>Chiron</prn>, freed by this time from human affairs and held worthy to share the home of the gods, who has come to assuage the grief of <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn>. Two maidens in a mule-cart, one holding the reins and the other wearing a veil upon her head, are thought to be <prn id='Q135224'>Nausicaa</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q496595'>Alcinous</prn>, and her handmaiden, driving to the washing-pits. The man shooting at <prn id='Q83203'>Centaurs</prn>, some of which he has killed, is plainly <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, and the exploit is one of his. </p>
<p id='5.19.10'><b>5.19.10</b> As to the maker of the chest, I found it impossible to form any conjecture. But the inscriptions upon it, though possibly composed by some other poet, are, as I was on the whole inclined to hold, the work of <prn id='Q391254'>Eumelus</prn> of <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl>. My main reason for this view is the processional hymn he wrote for <pl id='Q106802906'>Delos</pl>. </p>
<p id='5.20.1'><b>5.20.1</b> There are here other offerings also: a couch of no great size and for the most part adorned with ivory; the quoit of <prn id='Q2298655'>Iphitus</prn>; a table on which are set out the crowns for the victors. The couch is said to have been a toy of <prn id='Q328354'>Hippodameia</prn>. The quoit of <prn id='Q2298655'>Iphitus</prn> has inscribed upon it the truce which the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> proclaim at the <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> festivals; the inscription is not written in a straight line, but the letters run in a circle round the quoit. </p>
<p id='5.20.2'><b>5.20.2</b> The table is made of ivory and gold, and is the work of <prn id='Q1234536'>Colotes</prn>. <prn id='Q1234536'>Colotes</prn> is said to have been a native of Heracleia, but specialists in the history of sculpture maintain that he was a <pl id='Q65040323'>Parian</pl>, a pupil of <prn id='Q1934954'>Pasiteles</prn>, who himself was a pupil of . . . There are figures of <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn>, <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, the <prn id='Q334486'>Mother</prn> of the gods, <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn>, and <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> with <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>. Behind is the disposition of the games. </p>
<p id='5.20.3'><b>5.20.3</b> On one side are <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> and <prn id='Q202257'>Health</prn>, one of his daughters; <prn id='Q40901'>Ares</prn> too and <prn id='Q395257'>Contest</prn> by his side; on the other are <prn id='Q152262'>Plouton</prn>, <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>, <prn id='Q45967'>Persephone</prn> and <prn id='Q373916'>Nymphs</prn>, one of them carrying a ball. As to the key (<prn id='Q152262'>Plouton</prn> holds a key) they say that what is called <prn id='Q41410'>Hades</prn> has been locked up by <prn id='Q152262'>Plouton</prn>, and that nobody will return back again therefrom. </p>
<p id='5.20.4'><b>5.20.4</b> I must not omit the story told by <prn id='Q106796783'>Aristarchus</prn>, the guide to the sights at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>. He said that in his day the roof of the <pl id='Q633572'>Heraeum</pl> had fallen into decay. When the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> were repairing it, the corpse of a foot-soldier with wounds was discovered between the roof supporting the tiles and the ornamented ceiling. This soldier took part in the battle in the <pl id='Q2400346'>Altis</pl> between the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> and the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. </p>
<p id='5.20.5'><b>5.20.5</b> The <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> in fact climbed to defend themselves on to all high places alike, including the sanctuaries of the gods. At any rate this soldier seemed to us to have crept under here after growing faint with his wounds, and so died. Lying in a completely sheltered spot the corpse would suffer harm neither from the heat of summer nor from the frost of winter. <prn id='Q106796783'>Aristarchus</prn> said further that they carried the corpse outside the <pl id='Q2400346'>Altis</pl> and buried him in the earth along with his armour. </p>
<p id='5.20.6'><b>5.20.6</b> What the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> call the pillar of <prn id='Q847890'>Oenomaus</prn> is in the direction of the sanctuary of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> as you go from the great altar. On the left are four pillars with a roof on them, the whole constructed to protect a wooden pillar which has decayed through age, being for the most part held together by bands. This pillar, so runs the tale, stood in the house of <prn id='Q847890'>Oenomaus</prn>. Struck by lightning the rest of the house was destroyed by the fire; of all the building only this pillar was left. </p>
<p id='5.20.7'><b>5.20.7</b> A bronze tablet in front of it has the following elegiac inscription: <br>“Stranger, I am a remnant of a famous house, <br>I, who once was a pillar in the house of <prn id='Q847890'>Oenomaus</prn>; <br>Now by <prn id='Q44204'>Cronus</prn>' son I lie with these bands upon me, <br>A precious thing, and the baleful flame of fire consumed me not.” <br>In my time another incident took place, which I will relate. </p>
<p id='5.20.8'><b>5.20.8</b> A Roman senator won an <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> victory. Wishing to leave behind, as a memorial of his victory, a bronze statue with an inscription, he proceeded to dig, so as to make a foundation. When his excavation came very close to the pillar of <prn id='Q847890'>Oenomaus</prn>, the diggers found there fragments of armour, bridles and curbs. </p>
<p id='5.20.9'><b>5.20.9</b> These I saw myself as they were being dug out. A temple of no great size in the <prn id='Q192664'>Doric</prn> style they have called down to the present day <pl id='Q1925760'>Metroum</pl>, keeping its ancient name. No image lies in it of the <prn id='Q334486'>Mother</prn> of the gods, but there stand in it statues of Roman emperors. The <pl id='Q1925760'>Metroum</pl> is within the <pl id='Q2400346'>Altis</pl>, and so is a round building called the <pl id='Q3396766'>Philippeum</pl>. On the roof of the <pl id='Q3396766'>Philippeum</pl> is a bronze poppy which binds the beams together. </p>
<p id='5.20.10'><b>5.20.10</b> This <pl id='Q3396766'>building</pl> is on the left of the exit over against the <pl id='Q23889050'>Prytaneum</pl>. It is made of burnt brick and is surrounded by columns. It was built by <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn> after the fall of Greece at <pl id='Q13574678'>Chaeroneia</pl>. Here are set statues of <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn> and <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn>, and with them is <prn id='Q313907'>Amyntas</prn>, <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn>'s father. These works too are by <prn id='Q323430'>Leochares</prn>, and are of ivory and gold, as are the statues of <prn id='Q223134'>Olympias</prn> and <prn id='Q458544'>Eurydice</prn>. </p>
<p id='5.21.1'><b>5.21.1</b> From this point my account will proceed to a description of the statues and votive offerings; but I think that it would be wrong to mix up the accounts of them. For whereas on the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> <pl id='Q131013'>Acropolis</pl> statues are votive offerings like everything else, in the <pl id='Q2400346'>Altis</pl> some things only are dedicated in honor of the gods, and statues are merely part of the prizes awarded to the victors. The statues I will mention later; I will turn first to the votive offerings, and go over the most noteworthy of them. </p>
<p id='5.21.2'><b>5.21.2</b> As you go to the <pl id='Q4357227'>stadium</pl> along the road from the <pl id='Q1925760'>Metroum</pl>, there is on the left at the bottom of Mount <pl id='Q1250184'>Cronios</pl> a platform of stone, right by the very mountain, with steps through it. By the platform have been set up bronze images of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>. These have been made from the fines inflicted on athletes who have wantonly broken the rules of the contests, and they are called <prn id='Q146787'>Zanes</prn> (figures of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>) by the natives. </p>
<p id='5.21.3'><b>5.21.3</b> The first, six in number, were set up in the <prn id='Q57337789'>ninety-eighth Olympiad</prn> (388 BCE). For <prn id='Q22978072'>Eupolus</prn> of <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessaly</pl> bribed the boxers who entered the competition, AgetorYY the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadian</pl> and <prn id='Q2537664'>Prytanis</prn> of <pl id='Q615449'>Cyzicus</pl>, and with them also <prn id='Q22947047'>Phormio</prn> of <pl id='Q5843680'>Halicarnassus</pl>, who had won at the preceding Olympiad. This is said to have been the first time that an athlete violated the rules of the games, and the first to be fined by the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> were <prn id='Q22978072'>Eupolus</prn> and those who accepted bribes from <prn id='Q22978072'>Eupolus</prn>. Two of these images are the work of <prn id='Q5131686'>Cleon</prn> of <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl>; who made the next four I do not know. </p>
<p id='5.21.4'><b>5.21.4</b> Except the third and the fourth these images have elegiac inscriptions on them. The first of the inscriptions is intended to make plain that an <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> victory is to be won, not by money, but by swiftness of foot and strength of body. The inscription on the second image declares that the image stands to the glory of the deity, through the piety of the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>, and to be a terror to law-breaking athletes. The purport of the inscription on the fifth image is praise of the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>, especially for their fining the boxers; that of the sixth and last is that the images are a warning to all the Greeks not to give bribes to obtain an <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> victory. </p>
<p id='5.21.5'><b>5.21.5</b> Next after <prn id='Q22978072'>Eupolus</prn> they say that <prn id='Q11910957'>Callippus</prn> of <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, who had entered for the pentathlum, bought off his fellow-competitors by bribes, and that this offence occurred at the <prn id='Q57337805'>hundred and twelfth Olympiad</prn> (332 BCE). When the fine had been imposed by the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> on <prn id='Q11910957'>Callippus</prn> and his antagonists, the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> commissioned <prn id='Q314447'>Hypereides</prn> to persuade the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> to remit them the fine. The <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> refused this favour, and the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> were disdainful enough not to pay the money and to boycott the <prn id='Q188468'>Olympic games</prn>, until finally the god at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> declared that he would deliver no oracle on any matter to the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> before they had paid the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> the fine. </p>
<p id='5.21.6'><b>5.21.6</b> So when it was paid, images, also six in number, were made in honor of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>; on them are inscribed elegiac verses not a whit more elegant than those relating the fine of <prn id='Q22978072'>Eupolus</prn>. The gist of the first inscription is that the images were dedicated because the god by an oracle expressed his approval of the <pl id='Q6536845'>Elean</pl> decision against the pentathletes; on the second image and likewise on the third are praises of the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> for their fining the competitors in the pentathlum. </p>
<p id='5.21.7'><b>5.21.7</b> The fourth purports to say that the contest at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> is one of merit and not of wealth; the inscription on the fifth declares the reason for dedicating the images, while that on the sixth commemorates the oracle given to the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> by <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>. </p>
<p id='5.21.8'><b>5.21.8</b> The images next to those I have enumerated are two in number, and they were dedicated from a fine imposed on wrestlers. As to their names, neither I nor the guides of the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> knew them. On these images too are inscriptions; one says that the <pl id='Q13533316'>Rhodians</pl> paid money to <prn id='Q106460486'>Olympian</prn> <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> for the wrongdoing of a wrestler; the other that certain men wrestled for bribes and that the image was made from the fines imposed upon them. </p>
<p id='5.21.9'><b>5.21.9</b> The rest of the information about these athletes comes from the guides of the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>, who say that it was at the <prn id='Q57337890'>hundred and seventy-eighth Olympiad</prn> that Eudelus accepted a bribe from <prn id='Q2274948'>Philostratus</prn>, and that this <prn id='Q2274948'>Philostratus</prn> was a <pl id='Q13533316'>Rhodian</pl>. This account I found was at variance with the <pl id='Q6536845'>Elean</pl> record of <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> victories. In this record it is stated that <prn id='Q21644783'>Strato</prn> of <pl id='Q87'>Alexandria</pl> at the <prn id='Q57337890'>hundred and seventy-eighth Olympiad</prn> won on the same day the victory in the pancratium and the victory at wrestling. <pl id='Q87'>Alexandria</pl> on the Canopic mouth of the <pl id='Q3392'>Nile</pl> was founded by <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn> the son of <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn>, but it is said that previously there was on the site a small <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptian</pl> town called Racotis. </p>
<p id='5.21.10'><b>5.21.10</b> Three competitors before the time of this <prn id='Q21644783'>Strato</prn>, and three others after him, are known to have received the wild-olive for winning the pancratium and the wrestling: <prn id='Q11912219'>Caprus</prn> from <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> itself, and of the Greeks on the other side of the <pl id='Q34575'>Aegean</pl>, <prn id='Q21684183'>Aristomenes</prn> of <pl id='Q13533316'>Rhodes</pl> and <prn id='Q22132584'>Protophanes</prn> of <pl id='Q1432674'>Magnesia</pl> on the Lethaeus, were earlier than <prn id='Q21644783'>Strato</prn>; after him came Marion his compatriot, <prn id='Q16169936'>Aristeas</prn> of <pl id='Q1361187'>Stratoniceia</pl> (anciently both land and city were called <pl id='Q64161892'>Chrysaoris</pl>), and the seventh was <prn id='Q1992047'>Nicostratus</prn>, from <pl id='Q620864'>Cilicia</pl> on the coast, though he was in no way a Cilician except in name. </p>
<p id='5.21.11'><b>5.21.11</b> This <prn id='Q1992047'>Nicostratus</prn> while still a baby was stolen from <pl id='Q85794829'>Prymnessus</pl> in <pl id='Q32579'>Phrygia</pl> by robbers, being a child of a noble family. Conveyed to <pl id='Q60791230'>Aegeae</pl> he was bought by somebody or other, who some time afterwards dreamed a dream. He thought that a <prn id='Q140'>lion</prn>'s whelp lay beneath the pallet-bed on which <prn id='Q1992047'>Nicostratus</prn> was sleeping. Now <prn id='Q1992047'>Nicostratus</prn>, when he grew up, won other victories elsewhere, besides in the pancratium and wrestling at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>. </p>
<p id='5.21.12'><b>5.21.12</b> Afterwards others were fined by the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>, among whom was an <pl id='Q87'>Alexandrian</pl> boxer at the <prn id='Q57337945'>two hundred and eighteenth Olympiad</prn> [93 CE). The name of the man fined was <prn id='Q106785748'>Apollonius</prn>, with the surname of Rhantes — it is a sort of national characteristic for <pl id='Q87'>Alexandrians</pl> to have a surname. This man was the first <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptian</pl> to be convicted by the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> of a misdemeanor. </p>
<p id='5.21.13'><b>5.21.13</b> It was not for giving or taking a bribe that he was condemned, but for the following outrageous conduct in connection with the games. He did not arrive by the prescribed time, and the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>, if they followed their rule, had no option but to exclude him from the games. For his excuse, that he had been kept back among the <pl id='Q171132'>Cyclades</pl> islands by contrary winds, was proved to be an untruth by <prn id='Q23929468'>Heracleides</prn>, himself an <pl id='Q87'>Alexandrian</pl> by birth. He showed that <prn id='Q106785748'>Apollonius</prn> was late because he had been picking up some money at the <pl id='Q620874'>Ionian</pl> games. </p>
<p id='5.21.14'><b>5.21.14</b> In these circumstances the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> shut out from the games <prn id='Q106785748'>Apollonius</prn> with any other boxer who came after the prescribed time, and let the crown go to <prn id='Q23929468'>Heracleides</prn> without a contest. Whereupon <prn id='Q106785748'>Apollonius</prn> put on his gloves for a fight, rushed at <prn id='Q23929468'>Heracleides</prn>, and began to pummel him, though he had already put the wild-olive on his head and had taken refuge with the umpires. For this light-headed folly he was to pay dearly. </p>
<p id='5.21.15'><b>5.21.15</b> There are also two other images of modern workmanship. For at the <prn id='Q57337954'>two hundred and twenty-sixth Olympiad</prn> [125 CE] they detected that two boxing men, in a fight for victory only, had agreed about the issue for a sum of money. For this misconduct a fine was inflicted, and of the images of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> that were made, one stands on the left of the entrance to the <pl id='Q4357227'>stadium</pl> and the other on the right. Of the boxers, the one bribed was called <prn id='Q24308851'>Didas</prn>, and the briber was <prn id='Q106785221'>Sarapammon</prn>. They were from the same district, the newest in <pl id='Q11768'>Egypt</pl>, called <prn id='Q42890017'>Arsinoites</prn>. </p>
<p id='5.21.16'><b>5.21.16</b> It is a wonder in any case if a man has so little respect for the god of <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> as to take or give a bribe in the contests; it is an even greater wonder that one of the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> themselves has fallen so low. But it is said that the <pl id='Q6536845'>Elean</pl> <prn id='Q106785086'>Damonicus</prn> did so fall at the <prn id='Q57337907'>hundred and ninety-second Olympiad</prn>. They say that collusion occurred between <prn id='Q20871651'>Polyctor</prn> the son of <prn id='Q106785086'>Damonicus</prn> and <prn id='Q106264700'>Sosander</prn> of Smyrna, of the same name as his father; these were competitors for the wrestling prize of wild-olive. <prn id='Q106785086'>Damonicus</prn>, it is alleged, being exceedingly ambitious that his son should win, bribed the father of <prn id='Q106264700'>Sosander</prn>. </p>
<p id='5.21.17'><b>5.21.17</b> When the transaction became known, the <prn id='Q1491624'>Hellanodikai</prn> imposed a fine, but instead of imposing it on the sons they directed their anger against the fathers, for that they were the real sinners. From this fine images were made. One is set up in the <pl id='Q6536845'>Elean</pl> gymnasium; the other is in the <pl id='Q2400346'>Altis</pl> in front of what is called the <pl id='Q19611482'>Painted Portico</pl>, because anciently there were pictures on the walls. Some call this portico the <pl id='Q19611482'>Echo Portico</pl>, because when a man has shouted his voice is repeated by the echo seven or even more times. </p>
<p id='5.21.18'><b>5.21.18</b> They say that a pancratiast of <pl id='Q87'>Alexandria</pl>, by name <prn id='Q106303123'>Sarapion</prn>, at the <prn id='Q57337918'>two hundred and first Olympiad</prn>, was so afraid of his antagonists that on the day before the pancratium was to be called on he ran away. This is the only occasion on record when any man, not to say a man of <pl id='Q11768'>Egypt</pl>, was fined for cowardice. </p>
<p id='5.22.1'><b>5.22.1</b> These were the causes for which I found that these images were made. There are also images of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> dedicated by States and by individuals. There is in the <pl id='Q2400346'>Altis</pl> an altar near the entrance leading to the <pl id='Q4357227'>stadium</pl>. On it the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> do not sacrifice to any of the gods, but it is customary for the trumpeters and heralds to stand upon it when they compete. By the side of this altar has been built a pedestal of bronze, and on it is an image of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, about six cubits in height, with a thunderbolt in either hand. It was dedicated by the people of <pl id='Q5199870'>Cynaetha</pl>. The figure of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> as a boy wearing the necklace is the votive offering of Cleolas, a <pl id='Q1412043'>Phliasian</pl>. </p>
<p id='5.22.2'><b>5.22.2</b> By the side of what is called the <prn id='Q1619976'>Hippodamium</prn> is a semicircular stone pedestal, and on it are <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, <prn id='Q184437'>Thetis</prn>, and <prn id='Q192107'>Day</prn> entreating <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> on behalf of her children. These are on the middle of the pedestal. There are <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn> and <prn id='Q506781'>Memnon</prn>, one at either edge of the pedestal, representing a pair of combatants in position. There are other pairs similarly opposed, foreigner against Greek: <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn> opposed to <prn id='Q729332'>Helenus</prn>, reputed to be the cleverest men in the respective armies; <prn id='Q167646'>Alexander</prn> and <prn id='Q171839'>Menelaus</prn>, in virtue of their ancient feud; <prn id='Q82732'>Aeneas</prn> and <prn id='Q208256'>Diomedes</prn>, and <prn id='Q736813'>Deiphobus</prn> and <prn id='Q172725'>Ajax</prn> son of <prn id='Q331327'>Telamon</prn>. </p>
<p id='5.22.3'><b>5.22.3</b> These are the work of <prn id='Q6707302'>Lycius</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q192211'>Myron</prn>, and were dedicated by the people of <pl id='Q505703'>Apollonia</pl> on the <pl id='Q37495'>Ionian Sea</pl>. There are also elegiac verses written in ancient characters under the feet of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>. “As memorials of <pl id='Q505703'>Apollonia</pl> have we been dedicated, which on the <pl id='Q37495'>Ionian Sea</pl> <prn id='Q3382132'>Phoebus</prn> founded, he of the unshorn locks. The <pl id='Q505703'>Apollonians</pl>, after taking the land of <pl id='Q454510'>Abantis</pl>, set up here These images with heaven's help, tithe from <pl id='Q3035310'>Thronium</pl>.” The land called <pl id='Q454510'>Abantis</pl> and the town of <pl id='Q3035310'>Thronium</pl> in it were a part of the <pl id='Q2551754'>Thesprotian</pl> mainland over against the <pl id='Q1054699'>Ceraunian</pl> mountains. </p>
<p id='5.22.4'><b>5.22.4</b> When the Greek fleet was scattered on the voyage home from <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl>, <pl id='Q3354839'>Locrians</pl> from <pl id='Q3035310'>Thronium</pl>, a city on the river Boagrius, and <pl id='Q305516'>Abantes</pl> from <pl id='Q173096'>Euboea</pl>, with eight ships altogether, were driven on the <pl id='Q1054699'>Ceraunian</pl> mountains. Settling here and founding the city of Thronium, by common agreement they gave the name of <pl id='Q454510'>Abantis</pl> to the land as far as they occupied it. Afterwards, however, they were conquered in war and expelled by the people of <pl id='Q505703'>Apollonia</pl>, their neighbors. <pl id='Q505703'>Apollonia</pl> was a colony of <pl id='Q3693378'>Corcyra</pl>, they say, and <pl id='Q3693378'>Corcyra</pl> of <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl>, and the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthians</pl> had their share of the spoils. </p>
<p id='5.22.5'><b>5.22.5</b> A little farther on is a <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> turned towards the rising sun; he holds an <prn id='Q2092297'>eagle</prn> in one hand and in the other a thunderbolt. On him are set spring flowers, with a crown of them on his head. It is an offering of the people of <pl id='Q1058770'>Metapontum</pl>. The artist was <prn id='Q11906858'>Aristonous</prn> of <pl id='Q191082'>Aegina</pl>, but we do not know when he lived nor who his teacher was. </p>
<p id='5.22.6'><b>5.22.6</b> The <pl id='Q1412043'>Phliasians</pl> also dedicated a <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, the daughters of <prn id='Q622781'>Asopus</prn>, and <pl id='Q2866756'>Asopus</pl> himself.

There is a legend about <prn id='Q644692'>Corcyra</prn> that she mated with <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, and the same thing is said by <prn id='Q134929'>Pindar</prn> of <prn id='Q2416381'>Thebe</prn> and <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>. </p>
<p id='5.22.7'><b>5.22.7</b> Men of <pl id='Q3830644'>Leontini</pl> have set up a <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, not at public expense but out of their private purse.

It was dedicated by <prn id='Q106784853'>Hippagoras</prn>, <prn id='Q106784860'>Phrynon</prn>, and <prn id='Q4687784'>Aenesidemus</prn>, who in my opinion was some other <prn id='Q4687784'>Aenesidemus</prn> and not the tyrant of <pl id='Q3830644'>Leontini</pl>. </p>
<p id='5.23.1'><b>5.23.1</b> As you pass by the entrance to the Council Chamber you see an image of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> standing with no inscription on it, and then on turning to the north another image of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>. This is turned towards the rising sun, and was dedicated by those Greeks who at <pl id='Q204636'>Plataea</pl> fought against the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl> under <prn id='Q155063'>Mardonius</prn>. On the right of the pedestal are inscribed the cities which took part in the engagement: first the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, after them the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, third the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthians</pl>, fourth the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl>, </p>

<p id='5.23.3'><b>5.23.3</b> Of these cities the following are at the present day uninhabited: <pl id='Q132564'>Mycenae</pl> and <pl id='Q217379'>Tiryns</pl> were destroyed by the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> after the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl> wars. The <pl id='Q21027705'>Ambraciots</pl> and <pl id='Q12873561'>Anactorians</pl>, colonists of <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl>, were taken away by the Roman emperor to help to found <pl id='Q943637'>Nicopolis</pl> near <pl id='Q216551'>Actium</pl>. The <pl id='Q999468'>Potidaeans</pl> twice suffered removal from their city, once at the hands of <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q313907'>Amyntas</prn>, and once before this at the hands of the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>. Afterwards, however, <prn id='Q207183'>Cassander</prn> restored the <pl id='Q999468'>Potidaeans</pl> to their homes, but the name of the city was changed from <pl id='Q999468'>Potidaea</pl> to <pl id='Q999468'>Cassandreia</pl> after the name of its founder. The image at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> dedicated by the Greeks was made by <prn id='Q4752423'>Anaxagoras</prn> of <pl id='Q191082'>Aegina</pl>. The name of this artist is omitted by the historians of <pl id='Q742538'>Plataea</pl>. </p>
<p id='5.23.4'><b>5.23.4</b> In front of this <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> there is a bronze stele, on which are the terms of the <prn id='Q787429'>Thirty-years Peace</prn> between the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> and the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>. The <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> made this peace after they had reduced <pl id='Q173096'>Euboea</pl> for the second time, in the third year of the <prn id='Q57337769'>eighty-third Olympiad</prn> [446 BCE], when <prn id='Q17115359'>Crison</prn> of <pl id='Q1111219'>Himera</pl> won the foot-race. One of the articles of the treaty is to the effect that although <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> has no part in the treaty between <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> and <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>, yet the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> and the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> may privately, if they wish, be at peace with each other. Such are the terms of this treaty. </p>
<p id='5.23.5'><b>5.23.5</b> There is yet another image of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> dedicated beside the chariot of <prn id='Q20493381'>Cleosthenes</prn>. This chariot I will describe later; the image of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> was dedicated by the <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarians</pl>, and made by the brothers <prn id='Q106783765'>Psylacus</prn> and <prn id='Q11939356'>Onaethus</prn> with the help of their sons. About their date, their nation and who taught them, I can tell you nothing. </p>
<p id='5.23.6'><b>5.23.6</b> By the chariot of <prn id='Q468608'>Gelon</prn> stands an ancient <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> holding a scepter which is said to be an offering of the <pl id='Q3787772'>Hyblaeans</pl>. There were two cities in <pl id='Q4951156'>Sicily</pl> called <prn id='Q106784276'>Hybla</prn>, one surnamed <pl id='Q3787772'>Gereatis</pl> and the other Greater, it being in fact the greater of the two. They still retain their old names, and are in the district of Catana. <pl id='Q13635068'>Greater Hybla</pl> is entirely uninhabited, but <pl id='Q3787772'>Gereatis</pl> is a village of Catana, with a sanctuary of the goddess <prn id='Q106784276'>Hyblaea</prn> which is held in honor by the <pl id='Q4951156'>Sicilians</pl>. The people of <pl id='Q3787772'>Gereatis</pl>, I think, brought the image to <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>. For <prn id='Q712572'>Philistus</prn>, the son of Archomenides, says that they were interpreters of portents and dreams, and more given to devotions than any other foreigners in <pl id='Q4951156'>Sicily</pl>. </p>
<p id='5.23.7'><b>5.23.7</b> Near the offering of the <pl id='Q3787772'>Hyblaeans</pl> has been made a pedestal of bronze with a <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> upon it, which I conjecture to be about eighteen feet high. The donors and sculptors are set forth in elegiac verse: <br>“The <pl id='Q2537130'>Cleitorians</pl> dedicated this image to the god, a tithe <br>From many cities that they had reduced by force. <br>The sculptors were <prn id='Q11906548'>Aristo</prn> and <prn id='Q20101916'>Telestas</prn>, <br>Own brothers and <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconians</pl>.” <br>I do not think that these <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconians</pl> were famous all over Greece, for had they been so the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> would have had something to say about them, and the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> more still, seeing that they were their fellow-citizens. </p>
<p id='5.24.1'><b>5.24.1</b> By the side of the altar of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q1805711'>Laoetas</prn> and <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> <prn id='Q1805711'>Laoetas</prn> is a <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> on a bronze pedestal. The people of <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl> gave it and <prn id='Q1951047'>Musus</prn> made it, whoever this <prn id='Q1951047'>Musus</prn> may have been. As you go from the Bouleuterion to the <pl id='Q197019'>great temple</pl> there stands on the left an image of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, crowned as it were with flowers, and with a thunderbolt set in his right hand. It is the work of <prn id='Q731204'>Ascarus</prn> of <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>, a pupil of <prn id='Q1723440'>Canachus</prn> of <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl>. The inscription on it says that it is a tithe from the war between <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl> and <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessaly</pl>. </p>
<p id='5.24.2'><b>5.24.2</b> If the <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessalians</pl> went to war with <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl> and dedicated the offering from <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocian</pl> plunder, this could not have been the so-called “Sacred War,” but must have been a war between the two states previous to the invasion of Greece by the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl> under their king. Not far from this is a <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, which, as is declared by the verse inscribed on it, was dedicated by the <pl id='Q1187304'>Psophidians</pl> for a success in war. </p>
<p id='5.24.3'><b>5.24.3</b> On the right of the great temple is a <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> facing the rising of the sun, twelve feet high and dedicated, they say, by the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, when they entered on a war with the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> after their second revolt. On it is an elegiac couplet: “Accept, king, son of <prn id='Q44204'>Cronus</prn>, <prn id='Q106460486'>Olympian</prn> <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, a lovely image, And have a heart propitious to the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. </p>
<p id='5.24.4'><b>5.24.4</b> We know of no Roman, either commoner or senator, who gave a votive offering to a Greek sanctuary before <prn id='Q445455'>Mummius</prn>, and he dedicated at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> a bronze <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> from the spoils of <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaia</pl>. It stands on the left of the offering of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> by the side of the first pillar on this side of the temple. The largest of the bronze images of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> in the <pl id='Q2400346'>Altis</pl> is twenty-seven feet high, and was dedicated by the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> themselves from the plunder of the war with the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl>. </p>
<p id='5.24.5'><b>5.24.5</b> Beside the <pl id='Q7161678'>Pelopium</pl> is a pillar of no great height with a small image of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> on it; one hand is outstretched. Opposite this are other offerings in a row, and likewise images of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> and <prn id='Q131588'>Ganymedes</prn>. <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>'s poem tells how <prn id='Q131588'>Ganymedes</prn> was carried off by the gods to be wine-bearer to <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, and how <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn> were given to <prn id='Q599482'>Tros</prn> in exchange for him. This offering was dedicated by the <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessalian</pl> <prn id='Q106783090'>Gnathis</prn> and made by <prn id='Q666603'>Aristocles</prn>, pupil and son of <prn id='Q88464846'>Cleoetas</prn>. </p>
<p id='5.24.6'><b>5.24.6</b> There is also another <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> represented as a beardless youth, which is among offerings of <prn id='Q1934135'>Micythus</prn>. The history of <prn id='Q1934135'>Micythus</prn>, his family, and why he dedicated so many offerings at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>, my narrative will presently set forth. A little farther on in a straight line from the image I have mentioned is another beardless image of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>. It was dedicated by the people of <pl id='Q779669'>Elaea</pl>, who live in the first city of <pl id='Q255325'>Aeolis</pl> you reach on descending from the plain of the <pl id='Q1737602'>Caicus</pl> to the sea. </p>
<p id='5.24.7'><b>5.24.7</b> Yet another image of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> comes next, and the inscription on it says that it was dedicated by the Chersonesians of <pl id='Q690575'>Cnidus</pl> from enemy spoils. On either side of the image of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> they have dedicated images of <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn> and of the river <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl> respectively. The greater part of the city of <pl id='Q690575'>Cnidus</pl> is built on the <pl id='Q193214'>Carian</pl> mainland, where are their most noteworthy possessions, but what is called Chersonnesus is an island lying near the mainland, to which it is joined by a bridge. </p>
<p id='5.24.8'><b>5.24.8</b> It is the inhabitants of this quarter who dedicated to <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> the offerings at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>, just as if <pl id='Q47611'>Ephesians</pl> living in what is called Coresus were to say that they had dedicated an offering independently of the <pl id='Q47611'>Ephesians</pl> as a body. There is also by the wall of the <pl id='Q2400346'>Altis</pl> a <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> turned towards the setting of the sun; it bears no inscription, but is said to be another offering of <prn id='Q445455'>Mummius</prn> made from the plunder of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaean</pl> war. </p>
<p id='5.24.9'><b>5.24.9</b> But the <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> in the Council Chamber is of all the images of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> the one most likely to strike terror into the hearts of sinners. He is surnamed <prn id='Q4892498'>Horcius</prn> (oath-god), and in each hand he holds a thunderbolt. Beside this image it is the custom for athletes, their fathers and their brothers, as well as their trainers, to swear an oath upon slices of <prn id='Q58697'>boar</prn>'s flesh that in nothing will they sin against the <prn id='Q188468'>Olympic games</prn>. The athletes take this further oath also, that for ten successive months they have strictly followed the regulations for training. </p>
<p id='5.24.10'><b>5.24.10</b> An oath is also taken by those who examine the boys, or the foals entering for races, that they will decide fairly and without taking bribes, and that they will keep secret what they learn about a candidate, whether accepted or not. I forgot to inquire what it is customary to do with the <prn id='Q58697'>boar</prn> after the oath of the athletes, though the ancient custom about victims was that no human being might eat of that on which an oath had been sworn. </p>
<p id='5.24.11'><b>5.24.11</b> <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> proves this point clearly. For the <prn id='Q58697'>boar</prn>, on the slices of which <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn> swore that verily <prn id='Q244318'>Briseis</prn> had not lain with him, <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> says was thrown by the herald into the sea. “He spake, and cut the <prn id='Q58697'>boar</prn>'s throat with ruthless bronze; And the <prn id='Q58697'>boar</prn> <prn id='Q1367860'>Talthybius</prn> swung and cast into the great depth Of the grey sea, to feed the fishes.” Such was the ancient custom. Before the feet of the <prn id='Q4892498'>Oath</prn>-god is a bronze plate, with elegiac verses inscribed upon it, the object of which is to strike fear into those who forswear themselves. </p>
<p id='5.25.1'><b>5.25.1</b> I have enumerated the images of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> within the <pl id='Q2400346'>Altis</pl> with the greatest accuracy. For the offering near the great temple, though supposed to be a likeness of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, is really <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn>. It was set up by a <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthian</pl>, not one of the old <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthians</pl>, but one of those settlers whom the Emperor planted in the city. I shall also mention those offerings which are of a different kind, and not representations of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>. The statues which have been set up, not to honor a deity, but to reward mere men, I shall include in my account of the athletes. </p>
<p id='5.25.2'><b>5.25.2</b> The <pl id='Q4023782'>Messenians</pl> on the Strait in accordance with an old custom used to send to <pl id='Q3429952'>Rhegium</pl> a chorus of thirty-five boys, and with it a trainer and a flautist, to a local festival of <pl id='Q3429952'>Rhegium</pl>. On one occasion a disaster befell them for not one of those sent out returned home alive, but the ship with the boys on board went to the bottom. </p>
<p id='5.25.3'><b>5.25.3</b> The sea in fact at this strait is the stormiest of seas; it is made rough by winds bringing waves from both sides, from the <pl id='Q13924'>Adriatic</pl> and the other sea, which is called the <pl id='Q38882'>Tyrrhenian</pl>, and even if there be no gale blowing, even then the strait of itself produces a very violent swell and strong currents. So many monsters swarm in the water that even the air over the sea is infected with their stench. Accordingly a shipwrecked man has not even a hope left of getting out of the strait alive. If it was here that disaster overtook the ship of <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn>, nobody could believe that he swam out alive to <pl id='Q913582'>Italy</pl>, were it not that the benevolence of the gods makes all things easy. </p>
<p id='5.25.4'><b>5.25.4</b> On this occasion the <pl id='Q4023782'>Messenians</pl> mourned for the loss of the boys, and one of the honors bestowed upon them was the dedication of bronze statues at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>, the group including the trainer of the chorus and the flautist. The old inscription declared that the offerings were those of the <pl id='Q4023782'>Messenians</pl> at the strait; but afterwards <prn id='Q210573'>Hippias</prn>, called “a sage” by the Greeks, composed the elegiac verses on them. The artist of the statues was <prn id='Q1451668'>Callon</prn> of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>. </p>
<p id='5.25.5'><b>5.25.5</b> At the headland of <pl id='Q4951156'>Sicily</pl> that looks towards <pl id='Q2370577'>Libya</pl> and the south, called <pl id='Q1034750'>Pachynum</pl>, there stands the city <pl id='Q962184'>Motye</pl>, inhabited by <pl id='Q2370577'>Libyans</pl> and <pl id='Q41642'>Phoenicians</pl>. Against these foreigners of <pl id='Q962184'>Motye</pl> war was waged by the <pl id='Q3607380'>Agrigentines</pl>, who, having taken from them plunder and spoils, dedicated at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> the bronze boys, who are stretching out their right hands in an attitude of prayer to the god. They are placed on the wall of the <pl id='Q2400346'>Altis</pl>, and I conjectured that the artist was <prn id='Q918382'>Calamis</prn>, a conjecture in accordance with the tradition about them. <pl id='Q4951156'>Sicily</pl> is inhabited by the following races: </p>
<p id='5.25.6'><b>5.25.6</b> Sicanians, <pl id='Q4951156'>Sicels</pl>, and <pl id='Q32579'>Phrygians</pl>; the first two crossed into it from <pl id='Q913582'>Italy</pl>, while the <pl id='Q32579'>Phrygians</pl> came from the river <pl id='Q2488636'>Scamander</pl> and the land of the <pl id='Q2454671'>Troad</pl>. The <pl id='Q41642'>Phoenicians</pl> and <pl id='Q2370577'>Libyans</pl> came to the island on a joint expedition, and are settlers from <pl id='Q6343'>Carthage</pl>. Such are the foreign races in <pl id='Q4951156'>Sicily</pl>. The Greeks settled there include <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn> and <pl id='Q620874'>Ionians</pl>, with a small proportion of <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> and of Attics. </p>
<p id='5.25.7'><b>5.25.7</b> On the same wall as the offerings of the <pl id='Q3607380'>Agrigentines</pl> are two nude statues of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> as a boy. One represents him shooting the <prn id='Q199438'>lion</prn> at <pl id='Q748108'>Nemea</pl>. This <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> and the <prn id='Q140'>lion</prn> with him were dedicated by <prn id='Q106783063'>Hippotion</prn> of <pl id='Q3981082'>Tarentum</pl>, the artist being <prn id='Q11938770'>Nicodamus</prn> of <pl id='Q11936450'>Maenalus</pl>. The other image was dedicated by <prn id='Q3615071'>Anaxippus</prn> of <pl id='Q3305786'>Mende</pl>, and was transferred to this place by the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>. Previously it stood at the end of the road that leads from <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> to <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>, called the Sacred Road. </p>
<p id='5.25.8'><b>5.25.8</b> There are also offerings dedicated by the whole <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaean</pl> race in common; they represent those who, when <prn id='Q159666'>Hector</prn> challenged any Greek to meet him in single combat, dared to cast lots to choose the champion. They stand, armed with spears and shields, near the great temple. Right opposite, on a second pedestal, is a figure of <prn id='Q193267'>Nestor</prn>, who has thrown the lot of each into the helmet. The number of those casting lots to meet <prn id='Q159666'>Hector</prn> is now only eight, for the ninth, the statue of <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn>, they say that <prn id='Q1413'>Nero</prn> carried to <pl id='Q18287233'>Rome</pl>, </p>
<p id='5.25.9'><b>5.25.9</b> but <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn>'s statue is the only one of the eight to have his name inscribed upon it; the writing is from right to left. The figure with the cock emblazoned on the shield is <prn id='Q570434'>Idomeneus</prn> the descendant of <prn id='Q23168'>Minos</prn>. The story goes that <prn id='Q570434'>Idomeneus</prn> was descended from the <prn id='Q134270'>Sun</prn>, the father of <prn id='Q203236'>Pasiphae</prn>, and that the cock is sacred to the <prn id='Q134270'>Sun</prn> and proclaims when he is about to rise. </p>
<p id='5.25.10'><b>5.25.10</b> An inscription too is written on the pedestal: “To <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> these images were dedicated by the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, Descendants of <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn> the godlike scion of <prn id='Q182101'>Tantalus</prn>.” Such is the inscription on the pedestal, but the name of the artist is written on the shield of <prn id='Q570434'>Idomeneus</prn>: “This is one of the many works of clever <prn id='Q635170'>Onatas</prn>, the <pl id='Q191082'>Aeginetan</pl>, whose sire was <prn id='Q1387790'>Micon</prn>.” </p>
<p id='5.25.11'><b>5.25.11</b> Not far from the offering of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> there is also a <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> fighting with the <prn id='Q134154'>Amazon</prn>, a woman on horseback, for her girdle. It was dedicated by EvagorasYY, a <pl id='Q4023782'>Zanclaean</pl> by descent, and made by <prn id='Q666618'>Aristocles</prn> of <pl id='Q1481525'>Cydonia</pl>. <prn id='Q666618'>Aristocles</prn> should be included amongst the most ancient sculptors, and though his date is uncertain, he was clearly born before <pl id='Q4023782'>Zancle</pl> took its present name of <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl>. </p>
<p id='5.25.12'><b>5.25.12</b> The <pl id='Q2409204'>Thasians</pl>, who are <pl id='Q41642'>Phoenicians</pl> by descent, and sailed from <pl id='Q58455019'>Tyre</pl>, and from <pl id='Q41642'>Phoenicia</pl> generally, together with <prn id='Q2608087'>Thasus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q392631'>Agenor</prn>, in search of <prn id='Q165170'>Europa</prn>, dedicated at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> a <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, the pedestal as well as the image being of bronze. The height of the image is ten cubits, and he holds a club in his right hand and a bow in his left. They told me in <pl id='Q2409204'>Thasos</pl> that they used to worship the same <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> as the <pl id='Q58455019'>Tyrians</pl>, but that afterwards, when they were included among the Greeks, they adopted the worship of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> the son of <prn id='Q206214'>Amphitryon</prn>. </p>
<p id='5.25.13'><b>5.25.13</b> On the offering of the <pl id='Q2409204'>Thasians</pl> at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> there is an elegiac couplet: “<prn id='Q635170'>Onatas</prn>, son of <prn id='Q1387790'>Micon</prn>, fashioned me, He who has his dwelling in <pl id='Q191082'>Aegina</pl>.” This <prn id='Q635170'>Onatas</prn>, though belonging to the <pl id='Q191082'>Aeginetan</pl> school of sculpture, I shall place after none of the successors of <prn id='Q134756'>Daedalus</prn> or of the <pl id='Q122443'>Attic</pl> school. </p>
<p id='5.26.1'><b>5.26.1</b> The Dorian <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> who received <pl id='Q782278'>Naupactus</pl> from the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> dedicated at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> the image of <prn id='Q165023'>Victory</prn> upon the pillar. It is the work of <prn id='Q545845'>Paeonius</prn> of <pl id='Q3305786'>Mende</pl>, and was made from the proceeds of enemy spoils, I think from the war with the <pl id='Q416070'>Acarnanians</pl> and <pl id='Q2016870'>Oeniadae</pl>. The <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> themselves declare that their offering came from their exploit with the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> in the island of <pl id='Q1303524'>Sphacteria</pl>, and that the name of their enemy was omitted through dread of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>; for, they say, they are not in the least afraid of <pl id='Q2016870'>Oeniadae</pl> and the <pl id='Q416070'>Acarnanians</pl>. </p>
<p id='5.26.2'><b>5.26.2</b> The offerings of <prn id='Q1934135'>Micythus</prn> I found were numerous and not together. Next after <prn id='Q2298655'>Iphitus</prn> of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>, and Echecheiria crowning <prn id='Q2298655'>Iphitus</prn>, come the following offerings of <prn id='Q1934135'>Micythus</prn>: <prn id='Q180222'>Amphitrite</prn>, <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> and <prn id='Q41419'>Hestia</prn>; the artist was <prn id='Q11924334'>Glaucus</prn> the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl>. Along the left side of the great temple <prn id='Q1934135'>Micythus</prn> dedicated other offerings: <prn id='Q45967'>Kore</prn>, daughter of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>, <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>, <prn id='Q131588'>Ganymedes</prn> and <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, the poets <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> and <prn id='Q44233'>Hesiod</prn>, then again deities, <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> and <prn id='Q202257'>Health</prn>. </p>
<p id='5.26.3'><b>5.26.3</b> Among the offerings of <prn id='Q1934135'>Micythus</prn> is <prn id='Q395257'>Agon</prn> (Struggle) carrying jumping-weights, the shape of which is as follows. They are half of a circle, not an exact circle but elliptical, and made so that the fingers pass through as they do through the handle of a shield. Such are the fashion of them. By the statue of <prn id='Q395257'>Agon</prn> are <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>, <prn id='Q174353'>Orpheus</prn> the Thracian, and an image of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> which I mentioned just now. They are the works of <prn id='Q16190885'>Dionysius</prn> of <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>. They say that <prn id='Q1934135'>Micythus</prn> set up other offerings also in addition to these, and that they formed part of the treasures taken away by <prn id='Q1413'>Nero</prn>. </p>
<p id='5.26.4'><b>5.26.4</b> The artists are said to have been <prn id='Q16190885'>Dionysius</prn> and <prn id='Q11924334'>Glaucus</prn>, who were <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> by birth, but the name of their teacher is not recorded. Their date is fixed by that of <prn id='Q1934135'>Micythus</prn>, who dedicated the works of art at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>. For <prn id='Q26825'>Herodotus</prn> in his history says that this <prn id='Q1934135'>Micythus</prn>, when <prn id='Q2473927'>Anaxilas</prn> was despot of <pl id='Q3429952'>Rhegium</pl>, became his slave and steward of his property afterwards, on the death of <prn id='Q2473927'>Anaxilas</prn>, he went away to <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl>. </p>
<p id='5.26.5'><b>5.26.5</b> The inscriptions on the offerings give Choerus as the father of <prn id='Q1934135'>Micythus</prn>, and as his fatherland the Greek cities of <pl id='Q3429952'>Rhegium</pl> and <pl id='Q4023782'>Messene</pl> on the Strait. The inscriptions say that he lived at <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl>, and he dedicated the offerings at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> in fulfillment of a vow made for the recovery of a son, who fell ill of a wasting disease. </p>
<p id='5.26.6'><b>5.26.6</b> Near to the greater offerings of <prn id='Q1934135'>Micythus</prn>, which were made by the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl> <prn id='Q11924334'>Glaucus</prn>, stands an image of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> with a helmet on her head and clad in an aegis. <prn id='Q11938770'>Nicodamus</prn> of <pl id='Q11936450'>Maenalus</pl> was the artist, but it was dedicated by the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>. Beside the <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> has been set up a <prn id='Q165023'>Victory</prn>. The <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineans</pl> dedicated it, but they do not mention the war in the inscription. <prn id='Q918382'>Calamis</prn> is said to have made it without wings in imitation of the <prn id='Q693222'>xoanon</prn> at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> called <pl id='Q384813'>Wingless</pl> <prn id='Q165023'>Victory</prn>. </p>
<p id='5.26.7'><b>5.26.7</b> By the smaller offerings of <prn id='Q1934135'>Micythus</prn>, that were made by <prn id='Q16190885'>Dionysius</prn>, are some of the exploits of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, including what he did to the <prn id='Q199438'>Nemean lion</prn>, the <prn id='Q170379'>Hydra</prn>, the <prn id='Q83496'>Hound of Hades</prn>, and the <prn id='Q334456'>boar</prn> by the river <pl id='Q3555227'>Erymanthus</pl>. These were brought to <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> by the people of <pl id='Q302511'>Heracleia</pl> when they had overrun the land of the <pl id='Q6762088'>Mariandynians</pl>, their foreign neighbors. <pl id='Q302511'>Heracleia</pl> is a city built on the <pl id='Q621672'>Euxine</pl> sea, a colony of <pl id='Q42307600'>Megara</pl>, though the people of <pl id='Q56259452'>Tanagra</pl> in <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl> joined in the settlement. </p>
<p id='5.27.1'><b>5.27.1</b> Opposite the offerings I have enumerated are others in a row; they face towards the south, and are very near to that part of the precinct which is sacred to <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn>. Among them are those dedicated by the <pl id='Q11936450'>Maenalian</pl> <prn id='Q106623461'>Phormis</prn>. He crossed to <pl id='Q4951156'>Sicily</pl> from <pl id='Q11936450'>Maenalus</pl> to serve <prn id='Q468608'>Gelon</prn> the son of <prn id='Q3809562'>Deinomenes</prn>. Distinguishing himself in the campaigns of <prn id='Q468608'>Gelon</prn> and afterwards of his brother <prn id='Q335634'>Hieron</prn>, he reached such a pitch of prosperity that he dedicated not only these offerings at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>, but also others dedicated to <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>. </p>
<p id='5.27.2'><b>5.27.2</b> The offerings at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> are two <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn> and two charioteers, a charioteer standing by the side of each of the <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn>. The first <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn> and man are by <prn id='Q16190885'>Dionysius</prn> of <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>, the second are the work of <prn id='Q11949828'>Simon</prn> of <pl id='Q191082'>Aegina</pl>. On the side of the first of the <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn> is an inscription, the first part of which is not metrical. It runs thus: “<prn id='Q106623461'>Phormis</prn> dedicated me, an <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadian</pl> of <pl id='Q11936450'>Maenalus</pl>, now of <pl id='Q4420718'>Syracuse</pl>. </p>
<p id='5.27.3'><b>5.27.3</b> This is the <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn> in which is, say the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>, the hippomanes (what maddens <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn>). It is plain to all that the quality of the <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn> is the result of magic skill. It is much inferior in size and beauty to all the <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn> standing within the <pl id='Q2400346'>Altis</pl>. Moreover, its tail has been cut off which makes the figure uglier still. But male <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn>, not only in spring but on any day, are at heat towards it. </p>
<p id='5.27.4'><b>5.27.4</b> In fact they rush into the <pl id='Q2400346'>Altis</pl>, breaking their tethers or escaping from their grooms, and they leap upon it much more madly than upon a living brood mare, even the most beautiful of them. Their hoofs slip off, but nevertheless they keep on neighing more and more, and leap with a yet more violent passion, until they are driven away by whips and sheer force. In no other way can they be separated from the bronze <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn>. </p>
<p id='5.27.5'><b>5.27.5</b> There is another marvel I know of, having seen it in <pl id='Q620765'>Lydia</pl>; it is different from the <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn> of <prn id='Q106623461'>Phormis</prn>, but like it not innocent of the magic art. The <pl id='Q620765'>Lydians</pl> surnamed <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl> have sanctuaries in the city named Hierocaesareia and at <pl id='Q5957170'>Hypaepa</pl>. In each sanctuary is a chamber, and in the chamber are ashes upon an altar. But the color of these ashes is not the usual color of ashes. </p>
<p id='5.27.6'><b>5.27.6</b> Entering the chamber a magician piles dry wood upon the altar; he first places a tiara upon his head and then sings to some god or other an invocation in a foreign tongue unintelligible to Greeks, reciting the invocation from a book. So it is without fire that the wood must catch, and bright flames dart from it. </p>
<p id='5.27.7'><b>5.27.7</b> So much for this subject. Among these offerings is <prn id='Q106623461'>Phormis</prn> himself opposed to an enemy, and next are figures of him fighting a second and again a third. On them it is written that the soldier fighting is <prn id='Q106623461'>Phormis</prn> of <pl id='Q11936450'>Maenalus</pl>, and that he who dedicated the offerings was <prn id='Q2065138'>Lycortas</prn> of <pl id='Q4420718'>Syracuse</pl>. Clearly this <prn id='Q2065138'>Lycortas</prn> dedicated them out of friendship for <prn id='Q106623461'>Phormis</prn>. These offerings of <prn id='Q2065138'>Lycortas</prn> are also called by the Greeks offerings of <prn id='Q106623461'>Phormis</prn>. </p>
<p id='5.27.8'><b>5.27.8</b> The <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> carrying the ram under his arm, with a helmet on his head, and clad in tunic and cloak, is not one of the offerings of <prn id='Q106623461'>Phormis</prn>, but has been given to the god by the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> of <pl id='Q12885741'>Pheneus</pl>. The inscription says that the artist was <prn id='Q635170'>Onatas</prn> of <pl id='Q191082'>Aegina</pl> helped by <prn id='Q56823038'>Calliteles</prn>, who I think was a pupil or son of <prn id='Q635170'>Onatas</prn>. Not far from the offering of the <pl id='Q12885741'>Pheneatians</pl> is another image, <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> with a herald's wand. An inscription on it says that <prn id='Q20002641'>Glaucias</prn>, a <pl id='Q3429952'>Rhegian</pl> by descent, dedicated it, and Gallon of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> made it. </p>
<p id='5.27.9'><b>5.27.9</b> Of the bronze <prn id='Q473194'>oxen</prn> one was dedicated by the <pl id='Q3693378'>Corcyraeans</pl> and the other by the <pl id='Q16562724'>Eretrians</pl>. <prn id='Q106623427'>Philesius</prn> of <pl id='Q16562724'>Eretria</pl> was the artist. Why the <pl id='Q3693378'>Corcyraeans</pl> dedicated the <prn id='Q473194'>ox</prn> at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> and another at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> will be explained in my account of <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl>. About the offering at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> I heard the following story. </p>
<p id='5.27.10'><b>5.27.10</b> Sitting under this <prn id='Q473194'>ox</prn> a little boy was playing with his head bent towards the ground. Suddenly lifting his head he broke it against the bronze, and died a few days later from the wound. So the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> were purposing to remove the <prn id='Q473194'>ox</prn> from out the <pl id='Q2400346'>Altis</pl> as being guilty of bloodshed. But the god at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> gave an oracle that they were to let the offering stay where it was, after performing upon it the purificatory rites that are customary among the Greeks for unintentional shedding of blood. </p>
<p id='5.27.11'><b>5.27.11</b> Under the plane trees in the <pl id='Q2400346'>Altis</pl>, just about in the center of the enclosure, there is a bronze trophy, with an inscription upon the shield of the trophy, to the effect that the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> raised it as a sign that they had beaten the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. It was in this battle that the warrior lost his life who was found lying in his armour when the roof of the <pl id='Q633572'>Heraeum</pl> was being repaired in my time. </p>
<p id='5.27.12'><b>5.27.12</b> The offering of the <pl id='Q3305786'>Mendeans</pl> in <pl id='Q41741'>Thrace</pl> came very near to beguiling me into the belief that it was a representation of a competitor in the pentathlum. It stands by the side of <prn id='Q19945338'>Anauchidas</prn> of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>, and it holds ancient jumping-weights. An elegiac couplet is written on its thigh: “To <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, king of the gods, as first-fruits was I placed here By the <pl id='Q3305786'>Mendeans</pl>, who reduced SipteYY by might of hand.” SipteYY seems to be a Thracian fortress and city. The <pl id='Q3305786'>Mendeans</pl> themselves are of Greek descent, coming from <pl id='Q620874'>Ionia</pl>, and they live inland at some distance from the sea that is by the city of <pl id='Q14800358'>Aenus</pl>. </p>
<p id='6.1.1'><b>6.1.1</b> BOOK 6 <br>After my description of the votive offerings I must now go on to mention the statues of racehorses and those of men, whether athletes or ordinary folk. Not all the <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> victors have had their statues erected; some, in fact, who have distinguished themselves, either at the games or by other exploits, have had no statue. </p>
<p id='6.1.2'><b>6.1.2</b> These I am forced to omit by the nature of my work, which is not a list of athletes who have won <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> victories, but an account of statues and of votive offerings generally. I shall not even record all those whose statues have been set up, as I know how many have before now won the crown of wild olive not by strength but by the chance of the lot. Those only will be mentioned who themselves gained some distinction, or whose statues happened to be better made than others. </p>
<p id='6.1.3'><b>6.1.3</b> On the right of the <pl id='Q633572'>temple of Hera</pl> is the statue of a wrestler, <prn id='Q21102793'>Symmachus</prn> the son of AeschylusYY. He was an <pl id='Q6536845'>Elean</pl> by birth. Beside him is <prn id='Q22919776'>Neolaidas</prn>, son of ProxenusYY, from <pl id='Q12885741'>Pheneus</pl> in <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl>, who won a victory in the boys' boxing-match. Next comes <prn id='Q632547'>Archedamus</prn>, son of XeniosYY, another <pl id='Q6536845'>Elean</pl> by birth, who like <prn id='Q21102793'>Symmachus</prn> overthrew wrestlers in the contest for boys. The statues of the athletes mentioned above were made by <prn id='Q450334'>Alypus</prn> of <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl>, pupil of <prn id='Q594770'>Naucydes</prn> of <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>. </p>
<p id='6.1.4'><b>6.1.4</b> The inscription on <prn id='Q22978065'>Cleogenes</prn> the son of A1916 declares that he was a native, and that he won a prize with a riding-horse from his own private stable. Hard by <prn id='Q22978065'>Cleogenes</prn> are set up <prn id='Q22978056'>Deinolochus</prn>, son of PyrrhusYY, and <prn id='Q7845047'>Troilus</prn>, son of AlcinousYY. These also were both <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> by birth, though their victories were not the same. <prn id='Q7845047'>Troilus</prn>, at the time that he was <prn id='Q1491624'>Hellanodikes</prn>, succeeded in winning victories in the chariot-races, one for a chariot drawn by a full-grown pair and another for a chariot drawn by foals. The date of his victories was the <prn id='Q57337793'>hundred and second Olympiad</prn> [372 BCE]. </p>
<p id='6.1.5'><b>6.1.5</b> After this the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> passed a law that in future no <prn id='Q1491624'>Hellanodikes</prn> was to compete in the chariot-races. The statue of <prn id='Q7845047'>Troilus</prn> was made by <prn id='Q192222'>Lysippus</prn>. The mother of <prn id='Q22978056'>Deinolochus</prn> had a dream, in which she thought that the son she clasped in her bosom had a crown on his head. For this reason <prn id='Q22978056'>Deinolochus</prn> was trained to compete in the games and outran the boys. The artist was <prn id='Q5131686'>Cleon</prn> of <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl>. </p>
<p id='6.1.6'><b>6.1.6</b> As for <prn id='Q267195'>Cynisca</prn>, daughter of <prn id='Q313731'>Archidamus</prn>, her ancestry and <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> victories, I have given an account thereof in my history of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> kings. By the side of the statue of <prn id='Q867342'>Troilus</prn> at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> has been made a basement of stone, whereon are a chariot and <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn>, a charioteer, and a statue of <prn id='Q267195'>Cynisca</prn> herself, made by <prn id='Q216822'>Apelles</prn>; there are also inscriptions relating to <prn id='Q267195'>Cynisca</prn>. </p>
<p id='6.1.7'><b>6.1.7</b> Next to <prn id='Q267195'>Cynisca</prn> also have been erected statues of <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. They gained victories in chariot-races. <prn id='Q23929460'>Anaxander</prn> was the first of his family to be proclaimed victor with a chariot, but the inscription on him declares that previously his paternal grandfather received the crown for the pentathlum. <prn id='Q23929460'>Anaxander</prn> is represented in an attitude of prayer to the god, while <prn id='Q7226232'>Polycles</prn>, who gained the surname of Polychalcus, likewise won a victory with a four-horse chariot, and his statue holds a ribbon in the right hand. </p>
<p id='6.1.8'><b>6.1.8</b> Beside him are two children; one holds a wheel and the other is asking for the ribbon. <prn id='Q7226232'>Polycles</prn>, as the inscription on him says, also won the chariot-race at <pl id='Q682558'>Pytho</pl>, the <pl id='Q16600469'>Isthmus</pl> and <pl id='Q748108'>Nemea</pl>. </p>
<p id='6.2.1'><b>6.2.1</b> The statue of a pancratiast was made by <prn id='Q192222'>Lysippus</prn>. The athlete was the first to win the pancratium not only from <pl id='Q25408797'>Stratus</pl> itself but from the whole of <pl id='Q416070'>Acarnania</pl>, and his name was <prn id='Q20860934'>Xenarces</prn> the son of Philandrides. Now after the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl> invasion the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> became keener breeders of <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn> than any other Greeks. For beside those I have already mentioned, the following horse-breeders from <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> have their statues set up after that of the <pl id='Q416070'>Acarnanian</pl> athlete <prn id='Q20860934'>Xenarces</prn>, <prn id='Q27599744'>Lycinus</prn>, <prn id='Q22162657'>Arcesilaus</prn>, and <prn id='Q20085401'>Lichas</prn> his son. </p>
<p id='6.2.2'><b>6.2.2</b> <prn id='Q20860934'>Xenarces</prn> succeeded in winning other victories, at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>, at <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> and at <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl>. <prn id='Q20493486'>Lycinus</prn> brought foals to <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>, and when one of them was disqualified, entered his foals for the race for full-grown <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn>, winning with them. He also dedicated two statues at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>, works of <prn id='Q192211'>Myron</prn> the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl>. As for <prn id='Q22162657'>Arcesilaus</prn> and his son <prn id='Q20085401'>Lichas</prn>, the father won two <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> victories; his son, because in his time the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> were excluded from the games, entered his chariot in the name of the <pl id='Q11225429'>Theban</pl> people, and with his own hands bound the victorious charioteer with a ribbon. For this offence he was scourged by the <prn id='Q1491624'>Hellanodikai</prn>, </p>
<p id='6.2.3'><b>6.2.3</b> and on account of this <prn id='Q20085401'>Lichas</prn> the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> invaded <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> in the reign of King <prn id='Q202826'>Agis</prn>, when a battle took place within the <pl id='Q2400346'>Altis</pl>. When the war was over <prn id='Q20085401'>Lichas</prn> set up the statue in this place, but the <pl id='Q6536845'>Elean</pl> records of <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> victors give as the name of the victor, not <prn id='Q20085401'>Lichas</prn>, but the <pl id='Q11225429'>Theban</pl> people. </p>
<p id='6.2.4'><b>6.2.4</b> Near <prn id='Q20085401'>Lichas</prn> stands an <pl id='Q6536845'>Elean</pl> diviner, <prn id='Q45805945'>Thrasybulus</prn>, son of Aeneas of the <prn id='Q5980707'>Iamid</prn> family, who divined for the <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineans</pl> in their struggle against the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> under <prn id='Q299479'>Agis</prn>, son of <prn id='Q889042'>Eudamidas</prn>, their king. I shall have more to say about this in my account of the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl>. On the statue of <prn id='Q45805945'>Thrasybulus</prn> is a spotted lizard crawling towards his right shoulder, and by his side lies a <prn id='Q144'>dog</prn>, obviously a sacrificial victim, cut open and with his liver exposed. </p>
<p id='6.2.5'><b>6.2.5</b> Divination by <prn id='Q2934'>kids</prn>, <prn id='Q7368'>lambs</prn> or calves has, we all know, been established among men from ancient times, and the <pl id='Q644636'>Cyprians</pl> have even discovered how to practise the art by means of pigs; but no peoples are wont to make any use of <prn id='Q144'>dogs</prn> in divining. So <prn id='Q45805945'>Thrasybulus</prn> apparently established a method of divination peculiar to himself, by means of the entrails of <prn id='Q144'>dogs</prn>. The diviners called <prn id='Q5980707'>Iamidae</prn> are descended from <prn id='Q1655431'>Iamus</prn>, who, <prn id='Q134929'>Pindar</prn> says in an ode, was a son of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> and received the gift of divination from him. </p>
<p id='6.2.6'><b>6.2.6</b> By the statue of <prn id='Q354403'>Thrasybulus</prn> stands <prn id='Q7807000'>Timosthenes</prn> of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>, winner of the foot-race for boys, and <prn id='Q21684157'>Antipater</prn> of <pl id='Q169460'>Miletus</pl>, son of Cleinopater, conqueror of the boy boxers. Men of <pl id='Q4420718'>Syracuse</pl>, who were bringing a sacrifice from <prn id='Q332750'>Dionysius</prn> to <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>, tried to bribe the father of <prn id='Q21684157'>Antipater</prn> to have his son proclaimed as a <pl id='Q4420718'>Syracusan</pl>. But <prn id='Q21684157'>Antipater</prn>, thinking naught of the tyrant's gifts, proclaimed himself a <pl id='Q169460'>Milesian</pl> and wrote upon his statue that he was of <pl id='Q169460'>Milesian</pl> descent and the first <pl id='Q620874'>Ionian</pl> to dedicate his statue at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>. </p>
<p id='6.2.7'><b>6.2.7</b> The artist who made this statue was <prn id='Q193422'>Polycleitus</prn>, while that of <prn id='Q7807000'>Timosthenes</prn> was made by <prn id='Q1378985'>Eutychides</prn> of <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl>, a pupil of <prn id='Q192222'>Lysippus</prn>. This <prn id='Q1378985'>Eutychides</prn> made for the Syrians on the <pl id='Q188871'>Orontes</pl> an image of <prn id='Q213440'>Fortune</prn>, which is highly valued by the natives. </p>
<p id='6.2.8'><b>6.2.8</b> In the <pl id='Q2400346'>Altis</pl> by the side of <prn id='Q7807000'>Timosthenes</prn> are statues of <prn id='Q20493498'>Timon</prn> and of his son <prn id='Q21296336'>Aesypus</prn>, who is represented as a child seated on a <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn>. In fact the boy won the horse-race, while <prn id='Q20493498'>Timon</prn> was proclaimed victor in the chariot-race. The statues of <prn id='Q20493498'>Timon</prn> and of his son were made by <prn id='Q3704612'>Daedalus</prn> of <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl>, who also made for the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> the trophy in the <pl id='Q2400346'>Altis</pl> commemorating the victory over the <pl id='Q5690'>Spartans</pl>. </p>
<p id='6.2.9'><b>6.2.9</b> The inscription on the <pl id='Q13580795'>Samian</pl> boxer says that his trainer MyconYY dedicated the statue and that the <pl id='Q13580795'>Samians</pl> are best among the <pl id='Q620874'>Ionians</pl> for athletes and at naval warfare; this is what the inscription says, but it tells us nothing at all about the boxer himself. </p>
<p id='6.2.10'><b>6.2.10</b> Beside this is the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> <prn id='Q20056716'>Damiscus</prn>, who won an <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> victory at the age of twelve. I was exceedingly surprised to learn that while the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> were in exile from the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl>, their luck at the <prn id='Q188468'>Olympic games</prn> failed. For with the exception of <prn id='Q20493437'>Leontiscus</prn> and <prn id='Q19720525'>Symmachus</prn>, who came from <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl> on the Strait, we know of no Messenian, either from <pl id='Q4951156'>Sicily</pl> or from <pl id='Q782278'>Naupactus</pl>, who won a victory at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>. Even these two are said by the <pl id='Q4951156'>Sicilians</pl> to have been not <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> but of old <pl id='Q4023782'>Zanclean</pl> blood. </p>
<p id='6.2.11'><b>6.2.11</b> However, when the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> came back to the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl> their luck in the <prn id='Q188468'>Olympic games</prn> came with them. For at the festival celebrated by the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> in the year after the settlement of <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl>, the foot-race for boys was won by this <prn id='Q20056716'>Damiscus</prn>, who afterwards won in the pentathlum both at <pl id='Q748108'>Nemea</pl> and at the <pl id='Q16600469'>Isthmus</pl>. </p>
<p id='6.3.1'><b>6.3.1</b> Nearest to <prn id='Q20056716'>Damiscus</prn> stands a statue of somebody; they do not give his name, but it was <prn id='Q168261'>Ptolemy</prn> son of <prn id='Q718154'>Lagus</prn> who set up the offering. In the inscription <prn id='Q168261'>Ptolemy</prn> calls himself a <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonian</pl>, though he was king of <pl id='Q11768'>Egypt</pl>. On <prn id='Q20851861'>Chaereas</prn> of <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl>, a boy boxer, is an inscription that he won a victory when a young man, and that his father was ChaeremonYY; the name of the artist who made the statue is also written, <prn id='Q101545531'>Asterion</prn> son of AeschylusYY. </p>
<p id='6.3.2'><b>6.3.2</b> After <prn id='Q20851861'>Chaereas</prn> are statues of a <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> boy <prn id='Q20056746'>Sophius</prn> and of <prn id='Q20056748'>Stomius</prn>, a man of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>. <prn id='Q20056746'>Sophius</prn> outran his boy competitors, and Stomius won a victory in the pentathlum at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> and three at the <prn id='Q527006'>Nemean games</prn>. The inscription on his statue adds that, when commander of the <pl id='Q6536845'>Elean</pl> cavalry, he set up trophies and killed in single combat the general of the enemy, who had challenged him. </p>
<p id='6.3.3'><b>6.3.3</b> The <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> say that the dead general was a native of <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl> in command of <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonian</pl> troops, and that they themselves with the force from <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl> attacked <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl> out of friendship to the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl>. So the attack of the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> and <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> against <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl> apparently took place after the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> disaster at <pl id='Q2606004'>Leuctra</pl>. </p>
<p id='6.3.4'><b>6.3.4</b> Next stands the statue of a boxer from <pl id='Q5860679'>Lepreus</pl> in <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>, whose name was <prn id='Q19690049'>Labax</prn> son of Euphron1, and also that of <prn id='Q21809800'>Aristodemus</prn>, son of Thrasis, a boxer from <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> itself, who also won two victories at <pl id='Q682558'>Pytho</pl>. The statue of <prn id='Q21809800'>Aristodemus</prn> is the work of <prn id='Q3704612'>Daedalus</prn> of <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl>, the pupil and son of <prn id='Q11940513'>Patrocles</prn>. </p>
<p id='6.3.5'><b>6.3.5</b> The statue of <prn id='Q22978057'>Hippus</prn> of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>, who won the boys' boxing-match, was made by <prn id='Q15623025'>Damocritus</prn> of <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl>, of the school of <pl id='Q122443'>Attic</pl> <prn id='Q1186159'>Critias</prn>, being removed from him by four generations of teachers.

<p id='6.3.6'><b>6.3.6</b> <prn id='Q21490746'>Cratinus</prn> of <pl id='Q18363976'>Aegeira</pl> in <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaia</pl> was the most handsome man of his time and the most skilful wrestler, and when he won the wrestling-match for boys the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> allowed him to set up a statue of his trainer as well. The statue was made by <prn id='Q1723987'>Cantharus</prn> of <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl>, whose father was <prn id='Q4721397'>Alexis</prn>, while his teacher was <prn id='Q1378985'>Eutychides</prn>. </p>
<p id='6.3.7'><b>6.3.7</b> The statue of <prn id='Q3362836'>Eupolemus</prn> of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> was made by <prn id='Q3704612'>Daedalus</prn> of <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl>. The inscription on it informs us that <prn id='Q3362836'>Eupolemus</prn> won the foot-race for men at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>, and that he also received two <pl id='Q682558'>Pythian</pl> crowns for the pentathlum and another at the <prn id='Q527006'>Nemean games</prn>. It is also said of <prn id='Q3362836'>Eupolemus</prn> that three <prn id='Q1491624'>Hellanodikai</prn> stood on the course, of whom two gave their verdict in favour of <prn id='Q3362836'>Eupolemus</prn> and one declared the winner to be LeonYY the <pl id='Q21027705'>Ambraciot</pl>.

<p id='6.3.8'><b>6.3.8</b> The statue of <prn id='Q3717869'>Oebotas</prn> was set up by the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> by the command of the <pl id='Q682558'>Delphic</pl> <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> in the <prn id='Q57337763'>eightieth Olympiad</prn> [460 BCE], but <prn id='Q3717869'>Oebotas</prn> won his victory in the footrace at the <prn id='Q57337661'>sixth Olympiad</prn> [756 BCE]. How, therefore, could <prn id='Q3717869'>Oebotas</prn> have taken part in the Greek victory at <pl id='Q204636'>Plataea</pl>? For it was in the <prn id='Q57337756'>seventy-fifth Olympiad</prn> that the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl> under <prn id='Q155063'>Mardonius</prn> suffered their disaster at <pl id='Q204636'>Plataea</pl> [479 BCE]. Now I am obliged to report the statements made by the Greeks, though I am not obliged to believe them all.

<p id='6.3.9'><b>6.3.9</b> The statue of <prn id='Q19997826'>Antiochus</prn> was made by <prn id='Q11938770'>Nicodamus</prn>.

For the <pl id='Q5860679'>Lepreans</pl> are not afraid of the <prn id='Q675181'>Isthmian games</prn> as the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> themselves are. For example, <prn id='Q5962287'>Hysmon</prn> of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>, whose statue stands near that of <prn id='Q19997826'>Antiochus</prn>, competed successfully in the pentathlum both at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> and at <pl id='Q748108'>Nemea</pl>, but clearly kept away, just like other <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>, from the <prn id='Q675181'>Isthmian games</prn>. </p>
<p id='6.3.10'><b>6.3.10</b> It is said that when <prn id='Q5962287'>Hysmon</prn> was still a boy he was attacked by a flux in his muscles, and it was in order that by hard exercise he might be a healthy man free from disease that he practised the pentathlum. So his training was also to make him win famous victories in the games. His statue is the work of <prn id='Q5131686'>Cleon</prn>, but he holds jumping-weights of an ancient pattern. </p>

<p id='6.3.16'><b>6.3.16</b> But when fortune changed again, and <prn id='Q363832'>Conon</prn> had won the naval action off <pl id='Q690575'>Cnidus</pl> and the mountain called Dorium, the <pl id='Q620874'>Ionians</pl> likewise changed their views, and there are to be seen statues in bronze of <prn id='Q363832'>Conon</prn> and of <prn id='Q713679'>Timotheus</prn> both in the <pl id='Q841207'>sanctuary</pl> of <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> in <pl id='Q13580795'>Samos</pl> and also in the sanctuary of the <pl id='Q43018'>Ephesian</pl> goddess at <pl id='Q47611'>Ephesus</pl>.

<p id='6.4.1'><b>6.4.1</b> Next to the statue of <prn id='Q143559'>Lysander</prn> is an <pl id='Q47611'>Ephesian</pl> boxer who beat the other boys, his competitors — his name was <prn id='Q12359885'>Athenaeus</prn>, — and also a man of <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl> who was a pancratiast, <prn id='Q16854237'>Sostratus</prn> surnamed Acrochersites. For he used to grip his antagonist by the fingers and bend them, and would not let go until he saw that his opponent had given in. </p>
<p id='6.4.2'><b>6.4.2</b> He won at the <pl id='Q748108'>Nemean</pl> and <prn id='Q675181'>Isthmian games</prn> combined twelve victories, three victories at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> and two at <pl id='Q682558'>Pytho</pl>.

<p id='6.4.3'><b>6.4.3</b> Beside <prn id='Q16854237'>Sostratus</prn> is a statue of <prn id='Q20493437'>Leontiscus</prn>, a man wrestler, a native of <pl id='Q4951156'>Sicily</pl> from <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl> on the Strait. He was crowned, they say, by the <prn id='Q182875'>Amphictyons</prn> and twice by the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>, and his mode of wrestling was similar to the pancratium of <prn id='Q16854237'>Sostratus</prn> the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonian</pl>. For they say that <prn id='Q20493437'>Leontiscus</prn> did not know how to throw his opponents, but won by bending their fingers. </p>
<p id='6.4.4'><b>6.4.4</b> The statue was made by <prn id='Q2705569'>Pythagoras</prn> of <pl id='Q3429952'>Rhegium</pl>, an excellent sculptor if ever there was one.

<p id='6.4.5'><b>6.4.5</b> The boy who is binding his head with a fillet must be mentioned in my account because of <prn id='Q177302'>Pheidias</prn> and his great skill as a sculptor, but we do not know whose portrait the statue is that <prn id='Q177302'>Pheidias</prn> made. <prn id='Q20165817'>Satyrus</prn> of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>, son of Lysianax, of the clan of the <prn id='Q5980707'>Iamidae</prn>, won five victories at <pl id='Q748108'>Nemea</pl> for boxing, two at <pl id='Q682558'>Pytho</pl>, and two at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>. The artist who made the statue was <prn id='Q1230857'>Silanion</prn>, an <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl>. <prn id='Q7226232'>Polycles</prn>, another sculptor of the <pl id='Q122443'>Attic</pl> school, a pupil of <prn id='Q9341091'>Stadieus</prn> the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl>, has made the statue of an <pl id='Q47611'>Ephesian</pl> boy pancratiast, <prn id='Q23072115'>Amyntas</prn> the son of <prn id='Q504744'>Hellanicus</prn>. </p>

He was buried at the public expense by the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, and his fate it was to lose his life on the field of battle. My statement is borne out by the inscription at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>: “In wrestling only I alone conquered twice the men at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> and at <pl id='Q682558'>Pytho</pl>, Thrice at <pl id='Q748108'>Nemea</pl>, and four times at the <pl id='Q16600469'>Isthmus</pl> near the sea; <prn id='Q3566616'>Chilon</prn> of <pl id='Q133123'>Patrae</pl>, son of <prn id='Q34601'>Chilon</prn>, whom the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaean</pl> folk Buried for my valour when I died in battle.” </p>
<p id='6.4.7'><b>6.4.7</b> Thus much is plain from the inscription. But the date of <prn id='Q192222'>Lysippus</prn>, who made the statue, leads me to infer about the war in which <prn id='Q3566616'>Chilon</prn> fell, that plainly either he marched to <pl id='Q13574678'>Chaeroneia</pl> with the whole of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, or else his personal courage and daring led him alone of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> to fight against the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> under <prn id='Q204760'>Antipater</prn> at the battle of <pl id='Q192980'>Lamia</pl> in <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessaly</pl>. </p>
<p id='6.4.8'><b>6.4.8</b> Next to <prn id='Q3566616'>Chilon</prn> two statues have been set up. One is that of a man named Molpion, who, says the inscription, was crowned by the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>. The other statue bears no inscription, but tradition says that it represents <prn id='Q868'>Aristotle</prn> from <pl id='Q846127'>Stageira</pl> in <pl id='Q41741'>Thrace</pl>, and that it was set up either by a pupil or else by some soldier aware of <prn id='Q868'>Aristotle</prn>'s influence with <prn id='Q204760'>Antipater</prn> and at an earlier date with <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn>. </p>
<p id='6.4.9'><b>6.4.9</b> <prn id='Q25482023'>Sodamas</prn> from <pl id='Q744631'>Assos</pl> in the <pl id='Q2454671'>Troad</pl>, a city at the foot of <pl id='Q1127771'>Ida</pl>, was the first of the <pl id='Q255325'>Aeolians</pl> in this district to win at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> the foot-race for boys. By the side of <prn id='Q25482023'>Sodamas</prn> stands <prn id='Q448580'>Archidamus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q271850'>Agesilaus</prn>, king of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. Before this <prn id='Q448580'>Archidamus</prn> no king, so far as I could learn, had his statue set up by the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, at least outside the boundaries of the country. They sent the statue of <prn id='Q448580'>Archidamus</prn> to <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> chiefly, in my opinion, on account of his death, because he met his end in a foreign land, and is the only king in <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> who is known to have missed burial. </p>
<p id='6.4.10'><b>6.4.10</b> I have spoken at greater length on this matter in my account of <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>. <prn id='Q20493453'>Euanthes</prn> of <pl id='Q615449'>Cyzicus</pl> won prizes for boxing, one among the men at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>, and also among the boys at the <pl id='Q748108'>Nemean</pl> and at the <prn id='Q675181'>Isthmian games</prn>. By the side of <prn id='Q20493453'>Euanthes</prn> is the statue of a horse-breeder and his chariot; mounted on the chariot is a young maid. The man's name is <prn id='Q26215867'>Lampus</prn>, and his native city was the last to be founded in <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl>, named after its founder <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn>, son of <prn id='Q313907'>Amyntas</prn>. </p>
<p id='6.4.11'><b>6.4.11</b> The statue of <prn id='Q20008312'>Cyniscus</prn>, the boy boxer from <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantinea</pl>, was made by <prn id='Q193422'>Polycleitus</prn>. <prn id='Q1350653'>Ergoteles</prn>, the son of Philanor, won two victories in the long foot-race at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>, and two at <pl id='Q682558'>Pytho</pl>, the <pl id='Q16600469'>Isthmus</pl> and <pl id='Q748108'>Nemea</pl>. The inscription on the statue states that he came originally from <pl id='Q1111219'>Himera</pl>; but it is said that this is incorrect, and that be was a <pl id='Q4752820'>Cretan</pl> from <pl id='Q173527'>Cnossus</pl>. Expelled from <pl id='Q173527'>Cnossus</pl> by a political party he came to <pl id='Q1111219'>Himera</pl>, was given citizenship and won many honors besides. It was accordingly natural for him to be proclaimed at the games as a native of <pl id='Q1111219'>Himera</pl>. </p>
<p id='6.5.1'><b>6.5.1</b> The statue on the high pedestal is the work of <prn id='Q192222'>Lysippus</prn>, and it represents the mightiest (μέγιστος) of all men except those called heroes and any other mortal race that may have existed before the heroes. But this man, <prn id='Q3141687'>Polydamas</prn> the son of <prn id='Q315822'>Nicias</prn>, is the mightiest of our own era. </p>
<p id='6.5.2'><b>6.5.2</b> <pl id='Q8777773'>Scotussa</pl>, the native city of <prn id='Q3141687'>Polydamas</prn>, has now no inhabitants, for <prn id='Q465694'>Alexander</prn> the tyrant of <pl id='Q1330631'>Pherae</pl> seized it in time of truce. It happened that an assembly of the citizens was being held, and those who were assembled in the theater the tyrant surrounded with targeteers and archers, and shot them all down; all the other grown men he massacred, selling the women and children as slaves in order to pay his mercenaries. </p>
<p id='6.5.3'><b>6.5.3</b> This disaster befell <pl id='Q8777773'>Scotussa</pl> when <prn id='Q108823649'>Phrasicleides was archon</prn> [371/0 BCE] at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, in the <prn id='Q57337793'>hundred and second Olympiad</prn>, when <prn id='Q17115203'>Damon</prn> of <pl id='Q602564'>Thurii</pl> was victor for the second time, and in the second year of this Olympiad. The people that escaped remained but for a while, for later they too were forced by their destitution to leave the city, when Heaven brought a second calamity in the war with <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl>. </p>
<p id='6.5.4'><b>6.5.4</b> Others have won glorious victories in the pancratium, but <prn id='Q3141687'>Polydamas</prn>, besides his prizes for the pancratium [408 BCE], has to his credit the following exploits of a different kind. The mountainous part of <pl id='Q41741'>Thrace</pl>, on this side the river <pl id='Q193904'>Nestus</pl>, which runs through the land of <pl id='Q38280948'>Abdera</pl>, breeds among other wild beasts <prn id='Q140'>lions</prn>, which once attacked the army of <prn id='Q129165'>Xerxes</prn>, and mauled the <prn id='Q7375'>camels</prn> carrying his supplies. </p>
<p id='6.5.5'><b>6.5.5</b> These <prn id='Q140'>lions</prn> often roam right into the land around Mount <pl id='Q80344'>Olympus</pl>, one side of which is turned towards <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl>, and the other towards <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessaly</pl> and the river <pl id='Q376328'>Peneius</pl>. Here on Mount <pl id='Q80344'>Olympus</pl> <prn id='Q3141687'>Polydamas</prn> slew a <prn id='Q140'>lion</prn>, a huge and powerful beast, without the help of any weapon. To this exploit he was impelled by an ambition to rival the labours of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, because <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> also, legend says, overthrew the <prn id='Q140'>lion</prn> at <pl id='Q748108'>Nemea</pl>. </p>
<p id='6.5.6'><b>6.5.6</b> In addition to this, <prn id='Q3141687'>Polydamas</prn> is remembered for another wonderful performance. He went among a herd of <prn id='Q830'>cattle</prn> and seized the biggest and fiercest <prn id='Q693690'>bull</prn> by one of its hind feet, holding fast the hoof in spite of the <prn id='Q693690'>bull</prn>'s leaps and struggles, until at last it put forth all its strength and escaped, leaving the hoof in the grasp of <prn id='Q3141687'>Polydamas</prn>. It is also said of him that he stopped a charioteer who was driving his chariot onwards at a great speed. Seizing with one hand the back of the chariot he kept a tight hold on both <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn> and driver. </p>
<p id='6.5.7'><b>6.5.7</b> <prn id='Q202236'>Dareius</prn>, the bastard son of <prn id='Q189689'>Artaxerxes</prn>, who with the support of the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl> common people put down <prn id='Q298631'>Sogdius</prn>, the legitimate son of <prn id='Q189689'>Artaxerxes</prn>, and ascended the throne in his stead, learning when he was king of the exploits of <prn id='Q3141687'>Polydamas</prn>, sent messengers with the promise of gifts and persuaded him to come before his presence at <pl id='Q180773'>Susa</pl>. There he challenged three of the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl> called Immortals to fight him — one against three — and killed them. Of his exploits enumerated, some are represented on the pedestal of the statue at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>, and others are set forth in the inscription. </p>
<p id='6.5.8'><b>6.5.8</b> But after all, the prophecy of <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> respecting those who glory in their strength was to be fulfilled also in the case of <prn id='Q3141687'>Polydamas</prn>, and he too was fated to perish through his own might. For <prn id='Q3141687'>Polydamas</prn> entered a cave with the rest of his boon companions. It was summer-time, and, as ill-luck would have it, the roof of the cave began to crack. It was obvious that it would quickly fall in, and could not hold out much longer. </p>
<p id='6.5.9'><b>6.5.9</b> Realizing the disaster that was coming, the others turned and ran away; but <prn id='Q3141687'>Polydamas</prn> resolved to remain, holding up his hands in the belief that he could prevent the falling in of the cave and would not be crushed by the mountain. Here <prn id='Q3141687'>Polydamas</prn> met his end. </p>
<p id='6.6.1'><b>6.6.1</b> Beside the statue of <prn id='Q3141687'>Polydamas</prn> at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> stand two <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> and one <pl id='Q122443'>Attic</pl> athlete. The statue of the <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantinean</pl>, <prn id='Q21993076'>Protolaus</prn> the son of Dialces, who won the boxing-match for boys, was made by <prn id='Q2705569'>Pythagoras</prn> of <pl id='Q3429952'>Rhegium</pl>; that of <prn id='Q20493517'>Narycidas</prn>, son of DamaretusYY, a wrestler from <pl id='Q7623270'>Phigalia</pl>, was made by <prn id='Q3704612'>Daedalus</prn> of <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl>; that of the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> <prn id='Q24081455'>Callias</prn>, a pancratiast, is by the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> painter <prn id='Q1387790'>Micon</prn>. <prn id='Q11938770'>Nicodamus</prn> the <pl id='Q11936450'>Maenalian</pl> made the statue of the <pl id='Q11936450'>Maenalian</pl> pancratiast <prn id='Q12762328'>Androsthenes</prn>, the son of Lochaeus, who won two victories among the men. </p>
<p id='6.6.2'><b>6.6.2</b> By these is set up a statue of <prn id='Q11921137'>Eucles</prn>, son of Callianax, a native of <pl id='Q13533316'>Rhodes</pl> and of the family of the <prn id='Q1208207'>Diagoridae</prn>. For he was the son of the daughter of <prn id='Q777201'>Diagoras</prn>, and won an <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> victory in the boxing-match for men. His statue is by <prn id='Q594770'>Naucydes</prn>. <prn id='Q1342867'>Polycleitus</prn> of <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>, not the artist who made the image of <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn>, but a pupil of <prn id='Q594770'>Naucydes</prn>, made the statue of a boy wrestler, <prn id='Q23015309'>Agenor</prn> of <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>. The statue was dedicated by the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocian</pl> Commonwealth, for <prn id='Q106301413'>Theopompus</prn>, the father of <prn id='Q23015309'>Agenor</prn>, was a state friend of their nation. </p>
<p id='6.6.3'><b>6.6.3</b> <prn id='Q11938770'>Nicodamus</prn>, the sculptor from <pl id='Q11936450'>Maenalus</pl>, made the statue of the boxer <prn id='Q21993039'>Damoxenidas</prn> of <pl id='Q11936450'>Maenalus</pl>. There stands also the statue of the <pl id='Q6536845'>Elean</pl> boy <prn id='Q21993044'>Lastratidas</prn>, who won the crown for wrestling. He won a victory at <pl id='Q748108'>Nemea</pl> also among the boys, and another among the beardless striplings. <prn id='Q21993068'>Paraballon</prn>, the father of Lastratidas, was first in the double foot-race, and he left to those coming after an object of ambition, by writing up in the <pl id='Q25535896'>gymnasium</pl> at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> the names of those who won <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> victories. </p>
<p id='6.6.4'><b>6.6.4</b> So much for these. But it would not be right for me to pass over the boxer <prn id='Q8846610'>Euthymus</prn>, his victories and his other glories. <prn id='Q8846610'>Euthymus</prn> was by birth one of the <pl id='Q913582'>Italian</pl> <pl id='Q3836325'>Locrians</pl>, who dwell in the region near the headland called Zephyrion, and he was called son of AstyclesYY. Local legend, however, makes him the son, not of this man, but of the river Caecinus, which divides <pl id='Q3354839'>Locris</pl> from the land of <pl id='Q3429952'>Rhegium</pl> and produces the marvel of the grasshoppers. For the grasshoppers within <pl id='Q3354839'>Locris</pl> as far as the Caecinus sing just like others, but across the Caecinus in the territory of <pl id='Q3429952'>Rhegium</pl> they do not utter a sound. </p>
<p id='6.6.5'><b>6.6.5</b> This river then, according to tradition, was the father of <prn id='Q8846610'>Euthymus</prn>, who, though he won the prize for boxing at the seventy-fourth <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> Festival, was not to be so successful at the next. For <prn id='Q1388775'>Theagenes</prn> of <pl id='Q2409204'>Thasos</pl>, wishing to win the prizes for boxing and for the pancratium at the same Olympiad, overcame <prn id='Q8846610'>Euthymus</prn> at boxing, though he had not the strength to gain the wild olive in the pancratium, because he was already exhausted in his fight with <prn id='Q8846610'>Euthymus</prn>. </p>
<p id='6.6.6'><b>6.6.6</b> Thereupon the <prn id='Q1491624'>Hellanodikai</prn> fined <prn id='Q1388775'>Theagenes</prn> a talent, to be sacred to the god, and a talent for the harm done to <prn id='Q8846610'>Euthymus</prn>, holding that it was merely to spite him that he entered for the boxing competition. For this reason they condemned him to pay an extra fine privately to <prn id='Q8846610'>Euthymus</prn>. At the <prn id='Q57337758'>seventy-sixth Olympiad</prn> <prn id='Q1388775'>Theagenes</prn> paid in full the money owed to the god, . . . and as compensation to <prn id='Q8846610'>Euthymus</prn> did not enter for the boxing-match. At this Olympiad, and also at the next following, <prn id='Q8846610'>Euthymus</prn> won the crown for boxing. His statue is the handiwork of <prn id='Q2705569'>Pythagoras</prn>, and is very well worth seeing. </p>
<p id='6.6.7'><b>6.6.7</b> On his return to <pl id='Q913582'>Italy</pl> <prn id='Q8846610'>Euthymus</prn> fought against the Hero1, the story about whom is as follows. <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn>, so they say, in his wanderings after the capture of <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl> was carried down by gales to various cities of <pl id='Q913582'>Italy</pl> and <pl id='Q4951156'>Sicily</pl>, and among them he came with his ships to <pl id='Q3983093'>Temesa</pl>. Here one of his <prn id='Q838767'>sailors</prn> got drunk and violated a maiden, for which offence he was stoned to death by the natives. </p>
<p id='6.6.8'><b>6.6.8</b> Now <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn>, it is said, cared nothing about his loss and sailed away. But the ghost of the stoned man never ceased killing without distinction the people of <pl id='Q3983093'>Temesa</pl>, attacking both old and young, until, when the inhabitants had resolved to flee from <pl id='Q913582'>Italy</pl> for good, the <prn id='Q220344'>Pythian priestess</prn> forbad them to leave <pl id='Q3983093'>Temesa</pl>, and ordered them to propitiate the <prn id='Q838767'>Hero</prn>, setting him a sanctuary apart and building a temple, and to give him every year as wife the fairest maiden in <pl id='Q3983093'>Temesa</pl>. </p>
<p id='6.6.9'><b>6.6.9</b> So they performed the commands of the god and suffered no more terrors from the ghost. But <prn id='Q8846610'>Euthymus</prn> happened to come to <pl id='Q3983093'>Temesa</pl> just at the time when the ghost was being propitiated in the usual way; learning what was going on he had a strong desire to enter the temple, and not only to enter it but also to look at the maiden. When he saw her he first felt pity and afterwards love for her. The girl swore to marry him if he saved her, and so <prn id='Q8846610'>Euthymus</prn> with his armour on awaited the onslaught of the ghost. </p>
<p id='6.6.10'><b>6.6.10</b> He won the fight, and the <prn id='Q838767'>Hero</prn> was driven out of the land and disappeared, sinking into the depth of the sea. <prn id='Q8846610'>Euthymus</prn> had a distinguished wedding, and the inhabitants were freed from the ghost for ever. I heard another story also about <prn id='Q8846610'>Euthymus</prn>, how that he reached extreme old age, and escaping again from death departed from among men in another way. <pl id='Q3983093'>Temesa</pl> is still inhabited, as I heard from a man who sailed there as a merchant. </p>
<p id='6.6.11'><b>6.6.11</b> This I heard, and I also saw by chance a picture dealing with the subject. It was a copy of an ancient picture. There were a stripling, Sybaris, a river, Calabrus, and a spring, Lyca. Besides, there were a hero-shrine and the city of <pl id='Q3983093'>Temesa</pl>, and in the midst was the ghost that <prn id='Q8846610'>Euthymus</prn> cast out. Horribly black in color, and exceedingly dreadful in all his appearance, he had a <prn id='Q18498'>wolf</prn>'s skin thrown round him as a garment. The letters on the picture gave his name as Lycas. </p>
<p id='6.7.1'><b>6.7.1</b> So much for the story of <prn id='Q8846610'>Euthymus</prn>. After his statue stands a runner in the foot-race, <prn id='Q21993078'>Pytharchus</prn> of <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantinea</pl>, and a boxer, <prn id='Q21993047'>Charmides</prn> of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>, both of whom won prizes in the contests for boys. When you have looked at these also you will reach the statues of the <pl id='Q13533316'>Rhodian</pl> athletes, <prn id='Q777201'>Diagoras</prn> and his family. These were dedicated one after the other in the following order. <prn id='Q11904135'>Acusilaus</prn>, who received a crown for boxing in the men's class; <prn id='Q1245027'>Dorieus</prn>, the youngest, who won the pancratium at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> on three successive occasions. Even before <prn id='Q1245027'>Dorieus</prn>, <prn id='Q11916515'>Damagetus</prn> beat all those who had entered for the pancratium. </p>
<p id='6.7.2'><b>6.7.2</b> These were brothers, being sons of <prn id='Q777201'>Diagoras</prn>, and by them is set up also a statue of <prn id='Q777201'>Diagoras</prn> himself, who won a victory for boxing in the men's class. The statue of <prn id='Q777201'>Diagoras</prn> was made by the <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarian</pl> <prn id='Q11916357'>Callicles</prn>, the son of the <prn id='Q15445359'>Theocosmus</prn> who made the image of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> at <pl id='Q42307600'>Megara</pl>. The sons too of the daughters of <prn id='Q777201'>Diagoras</prn> practised boxing and won <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> victories: in the men's class <prn id='Q24576408'>Eucles</prn>, son of Callianax and <prn id='Q547838'>Callipateira</prn>, daughter of <prn id='Q777201'>Diagoras</prn>; in the boys' class <prn id='Q24576441'>Peisirodus</prn>, whose mother dressed herself as a man and a trainer, and took her son herself to the <prn id='Q188468'>Olympic games</prn>. </p>
<p id='6.7.3'><b>6.7.3</b> This <prn id='Q24576441'>Peisirodus</prn> is one of the statues in the <pl id='Q2400346'>Altis</pl>, and stands by the father of his mother. The story goes that <prn id='Q777201'>Diagoras</prn> came to <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> in the company of his sons <prn id='Q11904135'>Acusilaus</prn> and <prn id='Q11916515'>Damagetus</prn>. The youths on defeating their father proceeded to carry him through the crowd, while the Greeks pelted him with flowers and congratulated him on his sons. The family of <prn id='Q777201'>Diagoras</prn> was originally, through the female line, <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl>, as he was descended from the daughter of <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn>. </p>
<p id='6.7.4'><b>6.7.4</b> <prn id='Q1245027'>Dorieus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q777201'>Diagoras</prn>, besides his <pl id='Q38888'>Olympian</pl> victories, won eight at the <pl id='Q16600469'>Isthmian</pl> and seven at the <prn id='Q527006'>Nemean games</prn>. He is also said to have won a <pl id='Q682558'>Pythian</pl> victory without a contest. He and <prn id='Q24576441'>Peisirodus</prn> were proclaimed by the herald as of <pl id='Q602564'>Thurii</pl>, for they had been pursued by their political enemies from <pl id='Q13533316'>Rhodes</pl> to <pl id='Q602564'>Thurii</pl> in <pl id='Q913582'>Italy</pl>. <prn id='Q1245027'>Dorieus</prn> subsequently returned to <pl id='Q13533316'>Rhodes</pl>. Of all men he most obviously showed his friendship with <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>, for he actually fought against the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> with his own ships, until he was taken prisoner by <pl id='Q122443'>Attic</pl> men-of-war and brought alive to <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>. </p>
<p id='6.7.5'><b>6.7.5</b> Before he was brought to them the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> were wroth with <prn id='Q1245027'>Dorieus</prn> and used threats against him; but when they met in the assembly and beheld a man so great and famous in the guise of a prisoner, their feeling towards him changed, and they let him go away without doing him any hurt, and that though they might with justice have punished him severely. </p>
<p id='6.7.6'><b>6.7.6</b> The death of <prn id='Q1245027'>Dorieus</prn> is told by <prn id='Q514262'>Androtion</prn> in his <prn id='Q11853325'>Atthis</prn>. He says that the great King's fleet was then at <pl id='Q608095'>Caunus</pl>, with <prn id='Q363832'>Conon</prn> in command, who persuaded the <pl id='Q13533316'>Rhodian</pl> people to leave the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> alliance and to join the great King and the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>. <prn id='Q1245027'>Dorieus</prn>, he goes on to say, was at the time away from home in the interior of the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl>, and having been caught by some <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> he was brought to <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>, convicted of treachery by the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> and sentenced to death. </p>
<p id='6.7.7'><b>6.7.7</b> If <prn id='Q514262'>Androtion</prn> tells the truth, he appears to me to wish to put the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> on a level with the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, because they too are open to the charge of precipitous action in their treatment of <prn id='Q2244996'>Thrasyllus</prn> and his fellow admirals at the battle of <pl id='Q23822737'>Arginusae</pl>. Such was the fame won by <prn id='Q777201'>Diagoras</prn> and his family. </p>
<p id='6.7.8'><b>6.7.8</b> <prn id='Q2647362'>Alcaenetus</prn> too, son of Theantus, a <pl id='Q5860679'>Leprean</pl>, himself and his sons won <pl id='Q38888'>Olympian</pl> victories. <prn id='Q2647362'>Alcaenetus</prn> was successful in the boxing contest for men, as at an earlier date he had been in the contest for boys. His sons, <prn id='Q21882793'>Hellanicus</prn> and <prn id='Q21993083'>Theantus</prn>, were proclaimed winners of the boys' boxing-match, <prn id='Q21882793'>Hellanicus</prn> at the <prn id='Q57337777'>eighty-ninth Olympiad</prn> and <prn id='Q21993083'>Theantus</prn> at the next. All have their statues set up at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>. </p>
<p id='6.7.9'><b>6.7.9</b> Next to the sons of <prn id='Q2647362'>Alcaenetus</prn> stand <prn id='Q20666059'>Gnathon</prn>, a <pl id='Q112302501'>Maenalian</pl> of <pl id='Q1227119'>Dipaea</pl>, and <prn id='Q20666062'>Lycinus</prn> of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>. These too succeeded in beating the boys at boxing at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>. The inscription on his statue says that <prn id='Q20666059'>Gnathon</prn> was very young indeed when he won his victory. The artist who made the statue was <prn id='Q11916357'>Callicles</prn> of <pl id='Q42307600'>Megara</pl>. </p>
<p id='6.7.10'><b>6.7.10</b> A man from <pl id='Q2359730'>Stymphalus</pl>, by name <prn id='Q11917784'>Dromeus</prn> (Runner), proved true to it in the long race, for he won two victories at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>, two at <pl id='Q682558'>Pytho</pl>, three at the <pl id='Q16600469'>Isthmus</pl> and five at <pl id='Q748108'>Nemea</pl>. He is said to have also conceived the idea of a flesh diet; up to this time athletes had fed on cheese from the basket. The statue of this athlete is by <prn id='Q2705569'>Pythagoras</prn>; the one next to it, representing <prn id='Q21685730'>Pythocles</prn>, a pentathlete of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>, was made by <prn id='Q1342867'>Polycleitus</prn>. </p>
<p id='6.8.1'><b>6.8.1</b> <prn id='Q3965190'>Socrates</prn> of <pl id='Q2068130'>Pellene</pl> won the boys' race, and <prn id='Q21198108'>Amertes</prn> of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> the wrestlers' match for boys at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>, besides beating all competitors in the men's wrestling match at <pl id='Q682558'>Pytho</pl>. It is not said who made the statue of <prn id='Q3965190'>Socrates</prn>, but that of Amertes is from the band of <prn id='Q64320'>Phradmon</prn> of <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>. <prn id='Q19999625'>Euanoridas</prn> of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> won the boys' wrestling-match both at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> and at <pl id='Q748108'>Nemea</pl>. When he was made an <prn id='Q1491624'>Hellanodikes</prn> he joined the ranks of those who have recorded at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> the names of the victors. </p>
<p id='6.8.2'><b>6.8.2</b> As to the boxer, by name <prn id='Q5211993'>Damarchus</prn>, an <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadian</pl> of <pl id='Q7139774'>Parrhasia</pl>, I cannot believe (except, of course, his <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> victory) what romancers say about him, how he changed his shape into that of a <prn id='Q18498'>wolf</prn> at the sacrifice of <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> either record this of him, otherwise it would have been recorded as well in the inscription at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>, which runs: “This statue was dedicated by <prn id='Q5211993'>Damarchus</prn>, son of Dinytas, <pl id='Q7139774'>Parrhasian</pl> by birth from <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl>.” </p>
<p id='6.8.3'><b>6.8.3</b> Here the inscription ends. <prn id='Q793597'>Eubotas</prn> of <pl id='Q44112'>Cyrene</pl>, when the Libyan oracle foretold to him his coming <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> victory for running, had his portrait statue made beforehand, and so was proclaimed victor and dedicated the statue on the same day. He is also said to have won the chariot-race at that Olympiad which, according to the account of the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>, was not genuine because the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> presided at it. </p>
<p id='6.8.4'><b>6.8.4</b> The statue of <prn id='Q707873'>Timanthes</prn> of <pl id='Q1774167'>Cleonae</pl>, who won the crown in the pancratium for men, was made by <prn id='Q192211'>Myron</prn> of <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, but <prn id='Q594770'>Naucydes</prn> made that of <prn id='Q26161689'>Baucis</prn> of <pl id='Q581494'>Troezen</pl>, who overthrew the men wrestlers. <prn id='Q707873'>Timanthes</prn>, they say, met his end through the following cause. On retiring from athletics he continued to test his strength by drawing a great bow every day. His practice with the bow was interrupted during a period when he was away from home. On his return, finding that he was no longer able to bend the bow, he lit a fire and threw himself alive on to it. In my view all such deeds, whether they have already occurred among men or will take place hereafter, ought to be regarded as acts of madness rather than of courage. </p>
<p id='6.8.5'><b>6.8.5</b> After <prn id='Q26161689'>Baucis</prn> are statues of <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadian</pl> athletes: <prn id='Q1378903'>Euthymenes</prn> from <pl id='Q11936450'>Maenalus</pl> itself, who won the men's and previously the boys' wrestling-match; <prn id='Q26215868'>Philip</prn>, an <pl id='Q60791680'>Azanian</pl> from <pl id='Q2010159'>Pellana</pl>, who beat the boys at boxing, and <prn id='Q20493410'>Critodamus</prn> from <pl id='Q2537130'>Cleitor</pl>, who like <prn id='Q26215868'>Philip</prn> was proclaimed victor in the boys' boxing match. The statue of <prn id='Q1378903'>Euthymenes</prn> for his victory over the boys was made by <prn id='Q450334'>Alypus</prn>; the statue of <prn id='Q20493410'>Damocritus</prn> [sic] was made by <prn id='Q5131686'>Cleon</prn>, and that of <prn id='Q26215868'>Philip</prn> the <pl id='Q60791680'>Azanian</pl> by <prn id='Q192211'>Myron</prn>. The story of <prn id='Q7249671'>Promachus</prn>, son of Dryon, a pancratiast of <pl id='Q2068130'>Pellene</pl>, will be included in my account of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>. </p>
<p id='6.8.6'><b>6.8.6</b> Not far from <prn id='Q7249671'>Promachus</prn> is set up the statue of <prn id='Q7804584'>Timasitheus</prn>, a <pl id='Q682558'>Delphian</pl> by birth, the work of <prn id='Q452536'>Ageladas</prn> of <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>. This athlete won in the pancratium two victories at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> and three at <pl id='Q682558'>Pytho</pl>. His achievements in war too are distinguished by their daring and by the good luck which attended all but the last, which caused his death. For when <prn id='Q529472'>Isagoras</prn> the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> captured the <pl id='Q131013'>Acropolis</pl> of the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> with a view to setting up a tyranny, <prn id='Q7804584'>Timasitheus</prn> took part in the affair, and, on being taken prisoner on the <pl id='Q131013'>Acropolis</pl>, was put to death by the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> for his sin against them. </p>
<p id='6.9.1'><b>6.9.1</b> <prn id='Q21685716'>Theognetus</prn> of <pl id='Q191082'>Aegina</pl> succeeded in winning the crown for the boys' wrestling-match, and <prn id='Q20101565'>Ptolichus</prn> of <pl id='Q191082'>Aegina</pl> made his statue. <prn id='Q20101565'>Ptolichus</prn> was a pupil of his father <prn id='Q16857373'>Synnoon</prn>, and he of <prn id='Q2114391'>Aristocles</prn> the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonian</pl>, a brother of <prn id='Q1723440'>Canachus</prn> and almost as famous an artist. Why <prn id='Q21685716'>Theognetus</prn> carries a cone of the cultivated pine and a pomegranate I could not conjecture; perhaps some of the <pl id='Q191082'>Aeginetans</pl> may have a local story about it. </p>
<p id='6.9.2'><b>6.9.2</b> After the statue of the man who the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> say had not his name recorded with the others because he was proclaimed winner of the trotting-race, stand <prn id='Q21296349'>Xenocles</prn> of <pl id='Q11936450'>Maenalus</pl>, who overthrew the boys at wrestling, and <prn id='Q21296346'>Alcetus</prn>, son of AlcinousYY, victor in the boys' boxing-match, who also was an <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadian</pl> from <pl id='Q2537130'>Cleitor</pl>. <prn id='Q5131686'>Cleon</prn> made the statue of <prn id='Q21296346'>Alcetus</prn>; that of <prn id='Q21296349'>Xenocles</prn> is by <prn id='Q1342867'>Polycleitus</prn>. </p>
<p id='6.9.3'><b>6.9.3</b> <prn id='Q20851768'>Aristeus</prn> of <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> himself won a victory in the long-race, while his father <prn id='Q20851858'>Cheimon</prn> won the wrestling-match. They stand near to each other, the statue of <prn id='Q20851768'>Aristeus</prn> being by <prn id='Q11802753'>Pantias</prn> of <pl id='Q748832'>Chios</pl>, the pupil of his father <prn id='Q11950699'>Sostratus</prn>. Besides the statue of <prn id='Q20851858'>Cheimon</prn> at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> there is another in the <pl id='Q1456939'>Temple of Peace</pl> at <pl id='Q18287233'>Rome</pl>, brought there from <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>. Both are in my opinion among the most glorious works of <prn id='Q594770'>Naucydes</prn>. It is also told how <prn id='Q20851858'>Cheimon</prn> overthrew at wrestling <prn id='Q20852760'>Taurosthenes</prn> of <pl id='Q191082'>Aegina</pl>, how <prn id='Q20852760'>Taurosthenes</prn> at the next Olympiad overthrew all who entered for the wrestling-match, and how a wraith like <prn id='Q20852760'>Taurosthenes</prn> appeared on that day in <pl id='Q191082'>Aegina</pl> and announced the victory. </p>
<p id='6.9.4'><b>6.9.4</b> The statue of <prn id='Q20851855'>Philles</prn> of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>, who won the boys' wrestling-match, was made by the <pl id='Q5690'>Spartan</pl> <prn id='Q106159035'>Cratinus</prn>. As regards the chariot of <prn id='Q468608'>Gelon</prn>, I did not come to the same opinion about it as my predecessors, who hold that the chariot is an offering of the <prn id='Q468608'>Gelon</prn> who became tyrant in <pl id='Q4951156'>Sicily</pl>. Now there is an inscription on the chariot that it was dedicated by <prn id='Q468608'>Gelon</prn> of <pl id='Q58008539'>Gela</pl>, son of <prn id='Q3809562'>Deinomenes</prn>, and the date of the victory of this <prn id='Q468608'>Gelon</prn> is the <prn id='Q57337754'>seventy-third Olympiad</prn>. </p>
<p id='6.9.5'><b>6.9.5</b> But the <prn id='Q468608'>Gelon</prn> who was tyrant of <pl id='Q4951156'>Sicily</pl> took possession of <pl id='Q4420718'>Syracuse</pl> when <prn id='Q108823468'>Hybrilides was archon</prn> [491/90 BCE] at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, in the second year of the <prn id='Q57337753'>seventy-second Olympiad</prn>, when <prn id='Q16615971'>Tisicrates</prn> of <pl id='Q13526919'>Croton</pl> won the foot-race. Plainly, therefore, he would have announced himself as of <pl id='Q4420718'>Syracuse</pl>, not <pl id='Q58008539'>Gela</pl>. The fact is that this <prn id='Q468608'>Gelon</prn> must be a private person, of the same name as the tyrant, whose father had the same name as the tyrant's father. It was <prn id='Q1010974'>Glaucias</prn> of <pl id='Q191082'>Aegina</pl> who made both the chariot and the portrait-statue of <prn id='Q468608'>Gelon</prn>. </p>
<p id='6.9.6'><b>6.9.6</b> At the Olympiad previous to this it is said that <prn id='Q1569690'>Cleomedes</prn> of <pl id='Q216768'>Astypalaea</pl> killed <prn id='Q106947247'>Iccus</prn> of <pl id='Q233576'>Epidaurus</pl> during a boxing-match. On being convicted by the <prn id='Q1491624'>Hellanodikai</prn> of foul play and being deprived of the prize he became mad through grief and returned to <pl id='Q216768'>Astypalaea</pl>. Attacking a school there of about sixty children he pulled down the pillar which held up the roof. </p>
<p id='6.9.7'><b>6.9.7</b> This fell upon the children, and <prn id='Q1569690'>Cleomedes</prn>, pelted with stones by the citizens, took refuge in the sanctuary of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>. He entered a chest standing in the sanctuary and drew down the lid. The <pl id='Q216768'>Astypalaeans</pl> toiled in vain in their attempts to open the chest. At last, however, they broke open the boards of the chest, but found no <prn id='Q1569690'>Cleomedes</prn>, either alive or dead. So they sent envoys to <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> to ask what had happened to <prn id='Q1569690'>Cleomedes</prn>. </p>
<p id='6.9.8'><b>6.9.8</b> The response given by the <prn id='Q220344'>Pythian priestess</prn> was, they say, as follows: “Last of heroes is <prn id='Q1569690'>Cleomedes</prn> of <pl id='Q216768'>Astypalaea</pl>; Honor him with sacrifices as being no longer a mortal.” So from this time have the <pl id='Q216768'>Astypalaeans</pl> paid honors to <prn id='Q1569690'>Cleomedes</prn> as to a hero. </p>
<p id='6.9.9'><b>6.9.9</b> By the side of the chariot of <prn id='Q468608'>Gelon</prn> is dedicated a statue of <prn id='Q23044971'>Philon</prn>, the work of the <pl id='Q191082'>Aeginetan</pl> <prn id='Q1010974'>Glaucias</prn>. About this <prn id='Q23044971'>Philon</prn> <prn id='Q273003'>Simonides</prn> the son of <prn id='Q106137910'>Leoprepes</prn> composed a very neat elegiac couplet: “My fatherland is <pl id='Q3693378'>Corcyra</pl>, and my name is <prn id='Q23044971'>Philon</prn>; I am the son of GlaucusYY, and I won two <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> victories for boxing.” There is also a statue of <prn id='Q21102780'>Agametor</prn> of <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineia</pl>, who beat the boys at boxing. </p>
<p id='6.10.1'><b>6.10.1</b> Next to those that I have enumerated stands <prn id='Q932708'>Glaucus</prn> of <pl id='Q13554032'>Carystus</pl>. Legend has it that he was by birth from <pl id='Q2857905'>Anthedon</pl> in <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl>, being descended from <prn id='Q385397'>Glaucus</prn> the sea-deity. This <pl id='Q13554032'>Carystian</pl> was a son of <prn id='Q106137545'>Demylus</prn>, and they say that to begin with he worked as a farmer. The ploughshare one day fell out of the plough, and he fitted it into its place, using his hand as a hammer; </p>
<p id='6.10.2'><b>6.10.2</b> <prn id='Q106137545'>Demylus</prn> happened to be a spectator of his son's performance, and thereupon brought him to <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> to box. There <prn id='Q932708'>Glaucus</prn>, inexperienced in boxing, was wounded by his antagonists, and when he was boxing with the last of them he was thought to be fainting from the number of his wounds. Then they say that his father called out to him, “Son, the plough touch.” So he dealt his opponent a more violent blow which forthwith brought him the victory. </p>
<p id='6.10.3'><b>6.10.3</b> He is said to have won other crowns besides, two at <pl id='Q682558'>Pytho</pl>, eight at the <pl id='Q748108'>Nemean</pl> and eight at the <prn id='Q675181'>Isthmian games</prn>. The statue of <prn id='Q932708'>Glaucus</prn> was set up by his son, while <prn id='Q1010974'>Glaucias</prn> of <pl id='Q191082'>Aegina</pl> made it. The statue represents a figure sparring, as <prn id='Q932708'>Glaucus</prn> was the best exponent of the art of all his contemporaries. When he died the <pl id='Q13554032'>Carystians</pl>, they say, buried him in the island still called the island of <prn id='Q932708'>Glaucus</prn>. </p>
<p id='6.10.4'><b>6.10.4</b> <prn id='Q20493414'>Damaretus</prn> of <pl id='Q3562285'>Heraea</pl>, his son and his grandson, each won two victories at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>. Those of <prn id='Q20493414'>Damaretus</prn> were gained at the <prn id='Q57337744'>sixty-fifth Olympiad</prn> (at which the race in full armour was instituted) and also at the one succeeding. His statue shows him, not only carrying the shield that modern competitors have, but also wearing a helmet on his head and greaves on his legs. In course of time the helmet and greaves were taken from the armour of competitors by both the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> and the Greeks generally. <prn id='Q20493479'>Theopompus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q20493414'>Damaretus</prn>, won his victories in the pentathlum, and his son <prn id='Q20493482'>Theopompus</prn> the second, named after his father, won his in the wrestling-match. </p>
<p id='6.10.5'><b>6.10.5</b> Who made the statue of <prn id='Q20493482'>Theopompus</prn> the wrestler we do not know, but those of his father and grandfather are said by the inscription to be by <prn id='Q1378788'>Eutelidas</prn> and <prn id='Q1088897'>Chrysothemis</prn>, who were <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>. It does not, however, declare the name of their teacher, but runs as follows: “<prn id='Q1378788'>Eutelidas</prn> and <prn id='Q1088897'>Chrysothemis</prn> made these works, <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>, who learnt their art from those who lived before.” <prn id='Q1056125'>Iccus</prn> the son of Nicolaidas of <pl id='Q3981082'>Tarentum</pl> won the <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> crown in the pentathlum, and afterwards is said to have become the best trainer of his day. </p>
<p id='6.10.6'><b>6.10.6</b> After <prn id='Q1056125'>Iccus</prn> stands <prn id='Q20493279'>Pantarces</prn> the <pl id='Q6536845'>Elean</pl>, beloved of <prn id='Q177302'>Pheidias</prn>, who beat the boys at wrestling. Next to <prn id='Q20493279'>Pantarces</prn> is the chariot of <prn id='Q20493381'>Cleosthenes</prn>, a man of <pl id='Q3567546'>Epidamnus</pl>. This is the work of <prn id='Q452536'>Ageladas</prn>, and it stands behind the <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> dedicated by the Greeks from the spoil of the battle of <pl id='Q204636'>Plataea</pl>. <prn id='Q20493381'>Cleosthenes</prn>' victory occurred at the <prn id='Q57337746'>sixty-sixth Olympiad</prn>, and together with the statues of his <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn> he dedicated a statue of himself and one of his charioteer. </p>
<p id='6.10.7'><b>6.10.7</b> There are inscribed the names of the <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn>, PhoenixYY and CoraxYY, and on either side are the <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn> by the yoke, on the right Cnacias, on the left Samus. This inscription in elegiac verse is on the chariot: <br>“<prn id='Q20493381'>Cleosthenes</prn>, son of Pontis, a native of <pl id='Q3567546'>Epidamnus</pl>, dedicated me <br>After winning with his <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn> a victory in the glorious games of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>.” </p>
<p id='6.10.8'><b>6.10.8</b> This <prn id='Q20493381'>Cleosthenes</prn> was the first of those who bred <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn> in Greece to dedicate his statue at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>. For the offering of <prn id='Q11921365'>Evagoras</prn> the <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconian</pl> consists of the chariot without a figure of <prn id='Q11921365'>Evagoras</prn> himself; the offerings of <prn id='Q210350'>Miltiades</prn> the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl>, which he dedicated at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>, I will describe in another part of my story. The <pl id='Q3567546'>Epidamnians</pl> occupy the same territory today as they did at first, but the modern city is not the ancient one, being at a short distance from it. The modern city is called <pl id='Q3567546'>Dyrrhachium</pl> from its founder. </p>
<p id='6.10.9'><b>6.10.9</b> <prn id='Q20493484'>Lycinus</prn> of <pl id='Q3562285'>Heraea</pl>, <prn id='Q20085423'>Epicradius</prn> of <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineia</pl>, <prn id='Q20085449'>Tellon</prn> of <pl id='Q7101662'>Oresthasion</pl>, and <prn id='Q20493264'>Agiadas</prn> of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> won victories in boys' matches; <prn id='Q20493484'>Lycinus</prn> for running, the rest of them for boxing. The artist who made the statue of <prn id='Q20085423'>Epicradius</prn> was <prn id='Q20101565'>Ptolichus</prn> of <pl id='Q191082'>Aegina</pl>; that of <prn id='Q20493264'>Agiadas</prn> was made by <prn id='Q106140399'>Serambus</prn>, also a native of <pl id='Q191082'>Aegina</pl>. The statue of <prn id='Q20493484'>Lycinus</prn> is the work of <prn id='Q5131686'>Cleon</prn>. Who made the statue of <prn id='Q20085449'>Tellon</prn> is not related. </p>
<p id='6.11.1'><b>6.11.1</b> Next to these are offerings of <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>, representing <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn> the son of <prn id='Q313907'>Amyntas</prn>, <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn> the son of <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn>, <prn id='Q184176'>Seleucus</prn> and <prn id='Q200401'>Antigonus</prn>. <prn id='Q200401'>Antigonus</prn> is on foot; the rest are on horseback. </p>
<p id='6.11.2'><b>6.11.2</b> Not far from the kings mentioned stands a <pl id='Q2409204'>Thasian</pl>, <prn id='Q1388775'>Theagenes</prn> the son of TimosthenYY. The <pl id='Q2409204'>Thasians</pl> say that TimosthenYY was not the father of <prn id='Q1388775'>Theagenes</prn>, but a priest of the <pl id='Q2409204'>Thasian</pl> <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, a phantom of whom in the likeness of TimosthenYY had intercourse with the mother of <prn id='Q1388775'>Theagenes</prn>. In his ninth year, they say, as he was going home from school, he was attracted by a bronze image of some god or other in the agora; so he caught up the image, placed it on one of his shoulders and carried it home. </p>
<p id='6.11.3'><b>6.11.3</b> The citizens were enraged at what he had done, but one of them, a respected man of advanced years, bade them not to kill the lad, and ordered him to carry the image from his home back again to the agora. This he did, and at once became famous for his strength, his feat being noised abroad throughout Greece. </p>
<p id='6.11.4'><b>6.11.4</b> The achievements of <prn id='Q1388775'>Theagenes</prn> at the <pl id='Q38888'>Olympian</pl> games have already — the most famous of them — been described in my story, how he beat <prn id='Q8846610'>Euthymus</prn> the boxer, and how he was fined by the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>. On this occasion the pancratium, it is said, was for the first time on record won without a contest, the victor being <prn id='Q11917785'>Dromeus</prn> of <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineia</pl>. At the Olympiad following this, <prn id='Q1388775'>Theagenes</prn> was the winner in the pancratium. </p>
<p id='6.11.5'><b>6.11.5</b> He also won three victories at <pl id='Q682558'>Pytho</pl>. These were for boxing, while nine prizes at <pl id='Q748108'>Nemea</pl> and ten at the <pl id='Q16600469'>Isthmus</pl> were won in some cases for the pancratium and in others for boxing. At <pl id='Q2089144'>Phthia</pl> in <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessaly</pl> he gave up training for boxing and the pancratium. He devoted himself to winning fame among the Greeks for his running also, and beat those who entered for the long race. His ambition was, I think, to rival <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn> by winning a prize for running in the fatherland of the swiftest of those who are called heroes. The total number of crowns that he won was one thousand four hundred. </p>
<p id='6.11.6'><b>6.11.6</b> When he departed this life, one of those who were his enemies while he lived came every night to the statue of <prn id='Q1388775'>Theagenes</prn> and flogged the bronze as though he were ill-treating <prn id='Q1388775'>Theagenes</prn> himself. The statue put an end to the outrage by falling on him, but the sons of the dead man prosecuted the statue for murder. So the <pl id='Q2409204'>Thasians</pl> dropped the statue to the bottom of the sea, adopting the principle of <prn id='Q28626'>Draco</prn>, who, when he framed for the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> laws to deal with homicide, inflicted banishment even on lifeless things, should one of them fall and kill a man. </p>
<p id='6.11.7'><b>6.11.7</b> But in course of time, when the earth yielded no crop to the <pl id='Q2409204'>Thasians</pl>, they sent envoys to <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>, and the god instructed them to receive back the exiles. At this command they received them back, but their restoration brought no remedy of the famine. So for the second time they went to the <prn id='Q220344'>Pythian priestess</prn>, saying that although they had obeyed her instructions the wrath of the gods still abode with them. </p>
<p id='6.11.8'><b>6.11.8</b> Whereupon the <prn id='Q220344'>Pythian priestess</prn> replied to them: “But you have forgotten your great <prn id='Q1388775'>Theagenes</prn>.” And when they could not think of a contrivance to recover the statue of <prn id='Q1388775'>Theagenes</prn>, fishermen, they say, after putting out to sea for a catch of fish caught the statue in their net and brought it back to land. The <pl id='Q2409204'>Thasians</pl> set it up in its original position, and are wont to sacrifice to him as to a god. </p>
<p id='6.11.9'><b>6.11.9</b> There are many other places that I know of, both among Greeks and among barbarians, where images of <prn id='Q1388775'>Theagenes</prn> have been set up, who cures diseases and receives honors from the natives. The statue of <prn id='Q1388775'>Theagenes</prn> is in the <pl id='Q2400346'>Altis</pl>, being the work of <prn id='Q1010974'>Glaucias</prn> of <pl id='Q191082'>Aegina</pl>. </p>
<p id='6.12.1'><b>6.12.1</b> Hard by is a bronze chariot with a man mounted upon it; race-<prn id='Q726'>horses</prn>, one on each side, stand beside the chariot, and on the <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn> are seated boys. They are memorials of <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> victories won by <prn id='Q335634'>Hiero</prn> the son of <prn id='Q3809562'>Deinomenes</prn>, who was tyrant of <pl id='Q4420718'>Syracuse</pl> after his brother <prn id='Q468608'>Gelo</prn>. But the offerings were not sent by <prn id='Q335634'>Hiero</prn>; it was <prn id='Q335634'>Hiero</prn>'s son <prn id='Q3707980'>Deinomenes</prn> who gave them to the god, <prn id='Q635170'>Onatas</prn> the <pl id='Q191082'>Aeginetan</pl> who made the chariot, and <prn id='Q918382'>Calamis</prn> who made the <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn> on either side and the boys on them. </p>
<p id='6.12.2'><b>6.12.2</b> By the chariot of <prn id='Q335634'>Hiero</prn> is a man of the same name as the son of <prn id='Q3809562'>Deinomenes</prn>.

After the death of <prn id='Q312326'>Agathocles</prn>, a former tyrant, tyranny again sprung up at <pl id='Q4420718'>Syracuse</pl> in the person of this <prn id='Q313675'>Hiero</prn>, who came to power in the second year of the <prn id='Q57337822'>hundred and twenty-sixth Olympiad</prn> [275 BCE], at which festival <prn id='Q27915430'>Idaeus</prn> of <pl id='Q44112'>Cyrene</pl> won the foot-race. </p>
<p id='6.12.3'><b>6.12.3</b> This <prn id='Q313675'>Hiero</prn> made an alliance with <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q403377'>Aeacides</prn>, sealing it by the marriage of <prn id='Q1073680'>Gelo</prn> his son and <prn id='Q12881713'>Nereis</prn> the daughter of <prn id='Q94848'>Pyrrhus</prn>. When the Romans went to war with <pl id='Q6343'>Carthage</pl> for the possession of <pl id='Q4951156'>Sicily</pl>, the <pl id='Q6343'>Carthaginians</pl> held more than half the island, and <prn id='Q313675'>Hiero</prn> sided with them at the beginning of the war. Shortly after, however, he changed over to the Romans, thinking that they were stronger, and firmer and more reliable friends. </p>
<p id='6.12.4'><b>6.12.4</b> He met his end at the hands of <prn id='Q11917214'>Deinomenes</prn>, a <pl id='Q4420718'>Syracusan</pl> by birth and an inveterate enemy of tyranny, who afterwards, when <prn id='Q1377877'>Hippocrates</prn> the brother of <prn id='Q1347118'>Epicydes</prn> had just come from <pl id='Q20108000'>Erbessus</pl> to <pl id='Q4420718'>Syracuse</pl> and was beginning to harangue the multitude, rushed at him with intent to kill him. But <prn id='Q1377877'>Hippocrates</prn> withstood him, and certain of the bodyguard over-powered and slew <prn id='Q11917214'>Deinomenes</prn>. The statues of <prn id='Q313675'>Hiero</prn> at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>, one on horseback and the other on foot, were dedicated by the sons of <prn id='Q313675'>Hiero</prn>, the artist being <prn id='Q11936716'>Micon</prn>, a <pl id='Q4420718'>Syracusan</pl>, the son of NiceratusYY. </p>
<p id='6.12.5'><b>6.12.5</b> After the likenesses of <prn id='Q313675'>Hiero</prn> stand <prn id='Q643609'>Areus</prn> the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> king, the son of <prn id='Q421190'>Acrotatus</prn>, and <prn id='Q317331'>Aratus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q2390163'>Cleinias</prn>, with another statue of <prn id='Q643609'>Areus</prn> on horseback. The statue of <prn id='Q317331'>Aratus</prn> was dedicated by the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthians</pl>, that of <prn id='Q643609'>Areus</prn> by the people of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>. </p>

The statue of <prn id='Q22583413'>Callon</prn> was made by <prn id='Q11916492'>Daippus</prn>; who made that of <prn id='Q22583409'>Hippomachus</prn> I do not know, but it is said that he overcame three antagonists without receiving a blow or any physical injury. </p>
<p id='6.12.7'><b>6.12.7</b> <prn id='Q19717044'>Theochrestus</prn> of <pl id='Q44112'>Cyrene</pl> bred <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn> after the traditional Libyan manner; he himself and before him his paternal grandfather of the same name won victories at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> with the four-horse chariot, while the father of <prn id='Q19717044'>Theochrestus</prn> won a victory at the <pl id='Q16600469'>Isthmus</pl>.

<p id='6.12.8'><b>6.12.8</b> The elegiac verses bear witness that <prn id='Q4692158'>Agesarchus</prn> of <pl id='Q16642811'>Triteia</pl>, the son of Haemostratus, won the boxing-match for men at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>, <pl id='Q748108'>Nemea</pl>, <pl id='Q682558'>Pytho</pl> and the <pl id='Q16600469'>Isthmus</pl>; they also declare that the <pl id='Q56760760'>Tritaeans</pl> are <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl>, but I found this statement to be untrue. For the founders of the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadian</pl> cities that attained to fame have well-known histories; while those that had all along been obscure because of their weakness were surely absorbed for this very reason into <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl>, being included in the decree then made by the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadian</pl> confederacy; </p>

However, one may assume that at the time of the inscription the <pl id='Q56760760'>Tritaeans</pl> were reckoned as <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl>, just as nowadays too certain of the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> themselves are reckoned as <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>. The statue of <prn id='Q4692158'>Agesarchus</prn> is the work of the sons of <prn id='Q3286930'>Polycles</prn>, of whom we shall give some account later on. </p>
<p id='6.13.1'><b>6.13.1</b> The statue of <prn id='Q705166'>Astylus</prn> of <pl id='Q13526919'>Crotona</pl> is the work of <prn id='Q2705569'>Pythagoras</prn>; this athlete won three successive victories at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>, in the short race and in the double race. But because on the two latter occasions he proclaimed himself a <pl id='Q4420718'>Syracusan</pl>, in order to please <prn id='Q335634'>Hiero</prn> the son of <prn id='Q3809562'>Deinomenes</prn>, the people of <pl id='Q13526919'>Crotona</pl> for this condemned his house to be a prison, and pulled down his statue set up by the temple of <pl id='Q3621968'>Lacinian</pl> <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn>. </p>
<p id='6.13.2'><b>6.13.2</b> There is also set up in <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> a slab recording the victories of <prn id='Q1074480'>Chionis</prn> the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl>. They show simplicity who have supposed that <prn id='Q1074480'>Chionis</prn> himself dedicated the slab, and not the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> people. Let us assume that, as the slab says, the race in armour had not yet been introduced; how could <prn id='Q1074480'>Chionis</prn> know whether the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> would at some future time add it to the list of events? But those are simpler still who say that the statue standing by the slab is a portrait of <prn id='Q1074480'>Chionis</prn>, it being the work of the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> <prn id='Q192211'>Myron</prn>. </p>
<p id='6.13.3'><b>6.13.3</b> Similar in renown to <prn id='Q1074480'>Chionis</prn> was <prn id='Q1336424'>Hermogenes</prn> of <pl id='Q464936'>Xanthus</pl>, a <pl id='Q620765'>Lydian</pl>, who won the wild olive eight times at three <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> festivals, and was surnamed <prn id='Q726'>Horse</prn> by the Greeks. <prn id='Q19636979'>Polites</prn> also you will consider a great marvel. This <prn id='Q19636979'>Polites</prn> was from <pl id='Q1054607'>Ceramus</pl> in <pl id='Q193214'>Caria</pl>, and showed at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> every excellence in running. For from the longest race, demanding the greatest stamina, he changed, after the shortest interval, to the shortest and quickest, and after winning a victory in the long race and immediately afterwards in the short race, he added on the same day a third victory in the double course. </p>
<p id='6.13.4'><b>6.13.4</b> <prn id='Q19636979'>Polites</prn> then in the second . . . and four, as they are grouped together by lot, and they do not start them all together for the race. The victors in each heat run again for the prize. So he who is crowned in the foot-race will be victorious twice. However, the most famous runner was <prn id='Q1066776'>Leonidas</prn> of <pl id='Q13533316'>Rhodes</pl>. He maintained his speed at its prime for four Olympiads, and won twelve victories for running. </p>
<p id='6.13.5'><b>6.13.5</b> Not far from the slab of <prn id='Q1074480'>Chionis</prn> at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> stands <prn id='Q20056696'>Scaeus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q521203'>Duris</prn>, a <pl id='Q13580795'>Samian</pl>, victor in the boys' boxing-match.

<p id='6.13.6'><b>6.13.6</b> By the side of the tyrant is a statue of <prn id='Q12875806'>Diallus</prn> the son of PollisYY, a <pl id='Q1379299'>Smyrnean</pl> by descent, and this <prn id='Q12875806'>Diallus</prn> declares that he was the first <pl id='Q620874'>Ionian</pl> to receive at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> a crown for the boys' pancratium. There are statues of <prn id='Q571969'>Thersilochus</prn> of <pl id='Q3693378'>Corcyra</pl> and of <prn id='Q21198115'>Aristion</prn> of <pl id='Q233576'>Epidaurus</pl>, the son of Theophiles, made by <prn id='Q193422'>Polycleitus</prn> the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl>; <prn id='Q21198115'>Aristion</prn> won a crown for the men's boxing, <prn id='Q571969'>Thersilochus</prn> for the boys'. </p>
<p id='6.13.7'><b>6.13.7</b> <prn id='Q19359640'>Bycelus</prn>, the first <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonian</pl> to win the boys' boxing-match, had his statue made by <prn id='Q1723440'>Canachus</prn> of <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl>, a pupil of the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl> <prn id='Q193422'>Polycleitus</prn>. By the side of <prn id='Q19359640'>Bycelus</prn> stands the statue of a man-at-arms, <prn id='Q88976791'>Mnaseas</prn> of <pl id='Q44112'>Cyrene</pl>, surnamed the Libyan; <prn id='Q2705569'>Pythagoras</prn> of <pl id='Q3429952'>Rhegium</pl> made the statue. To <prn id='Q27674526'>Agemachus</prn> of <pl id='Q615449'>Cyzicus</pl> from the mainland of <prn id='Q48'>Asia</prn> . . . the inscription on it shows that he was born at <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>. </p>
<p id='6.13.8'><b>6.13.8</b> <pl id='Q1233293'>Naxos</pl> was founded in <pl id='Q4951156'>Sicily</pl> by the <pl id='Q21235810'>Chalcidians</pl> on the <pl id='Q1137741'>Euripus</pl>. Of the city not even the ruins are now to be seen, and that the name of <pl id='Q1233293'>Naxos</pl> has survived to after ages must be attributed to <prn id='Q20056733'>Tisander</prn>, the son of Cleocritus. He won the men's boxing-match at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> four times; he had the same number of victories at <pl id='Q682558'>Pytho</pl>, but at this time neither the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthians</pl> nor the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> kept complete records of the victors at <pl id='Q748108'>Nemea</pl> and the <pl id='Q16600469'>Isthmus</pl>. </p>
<p id='6.13.9'><b>6.13.9</b> The mare of the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthian</pl> <prn id='Q20493497'>Pheidolas</prn> was called, the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthians</pl> relate, AuraYY (breeze), and at the beginning of the race she chanced to throw her rider. But nevertheless she went on running properly, turned round the post, and, when she heard the trumpet, quickened her pace, reached the <prn id='Q1491624'>Hellanodikai</prn> first, realized that she had won and stopped running. The <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> proclaimed <prn id='Q20493497'>Pheidolas</prn> the winner and allowed him to dedicate a statue of this mare. </p>
<p id='6.13.10'><b>6.13.10</b> The sons also of <prn id='Q20493497'>Pheidolas</prn> were winners in the horse-race, and the <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn> is represented on a slab with this inscription: <br>“The swift A1340 by one victory at the <pl id='Q16600469'>Isthmus</pl> and two here <br>Crowned the house of the sons of <prn id='Q20493497'>Pheidolas</prn>.” <br>But the inscription is at variance with the <pl id='Q6536845'>Elean</pl> records of <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> victors. These records give a victory to the sons of <prn id='Q20493497'>Pheidolas</prn> at the <prn id='Q57337749'>sixty-eighth Olympiad</prn> [508 BCE] but at no other. </p>
<p id='6.13.11'><b>6.13.11</b> You may take my statements as accurate. There are statues to <prn id='Q1752691'>Agathinus</prn>, son of ThrasybulYY, and to <prn id='Q20493472'>Telemachus</prn>, both men of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>. <prn id='Q20493472'>Telemachus</prn> won the race for four-horse chariots; the statue of <prn id='Q1752691'>Agathinus</prn> was dedicated by the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> of <pl id='Q2068130'>Pellene</pl>. The <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> people dedicated a statue of <prn id='Q3622700'>Aristophon</prn>, the son of Lysinus, who won the men's pancratium at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>. </p>
<p id='6.14.1'><b>6.14.1</b> <prn id='Q22694981'>Pherias</prn> of <pl id='Q191082'>Aegina</pl>, whose statue stands by the side of <prn id='Q21296344'>Aristophon</prn> the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl>, at the <prn id='Q57337760'>seventy-eighth Olympiad</prn> was considered very young, and, being judged to be as yet unfit to wrestle, was debarred from the contest. Out at the next Olympiad he was admitted to the boys' wrestling-match and won it. What happened to this <prn id='Q22694981'>Pherias</prn> was different, in fact the exact opposite of what happened at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> to <prn id='Q24353062'>Nicasylus</prn> of <pl id='Q13533316'>Rhodes</pl>. </p>
<p id='6.14.2'><b>6.14.2</b> Being eighteen years of age he was not allowed by the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> to compete in the boys' wrestling-match, but won the men's match and was proclaimed victor. He was afterwards proclaimed victor at <pl id='Q748108'>Nemea</pl> also and at the <pl id='Q16600469'>Isthmus</pl>. But when he was twenty years old he met his death before he returned home to <pl id='Q13533316'>Rhodes</pl>. The feat of the <pl id='Q13533316'>Rhodian</pl> wrestler at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> was in my opinion surpassed by <prn id='Q11906743'>Artemidorus</prn> of <pl id='Q462630'>Tralles</pl>. He failed in the boys' pancratium at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>, the reason of his failure being his extreme youth. </p>
<p id='6.14.3'><b>6.14.3</b> When, however, the time arrived for the contest held by the <pl id='Q620874'>Ionians</pl> of Smyrna, his strength had so increased that he beat in the pancratium on the same day those who had competed with him at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>, after the boys the beardless youths as they are called, and thirdly the pick of the men. His match with the beardless youths was the outcome, they say, of a trainer's encouragement; he fought the men because of the insult of a man pancratiast. <prn id='Q11906743'>Artemidorus</prn> won an <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> victory among the men at the <prn id='Q57337935'>two hundred and twelfth Olympiad</prn>. </p>
<p id='6.14.4'><b>6.14.4</b> Next to the statue of <prn id='Q24353062'>Nicasylus</prn> is a small bronze <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn>, which <prn id='Q24037819'>Crocon</prn> of <pl id='Q16562724'>Eretria</pl> dedicated when he won a crown with a racehorse. Near the <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn> is <prn id='Q19945345'>Telestas</prn> of <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl>, who won the boys' boxing-match. The artist who represented <prn id='Q19945345'>Telestas</prn> was <prn id='Q1230857'>Silanion</prn>. </p>
<p id='6.14.5'><b>6.14.5</b> The statue of <prn id='Q338948'>Milo</prn> the son of DiotimusYY was made by <prn id='Q15804436'>Dameas</prn>, also a native of <pl id='Q13526919'>Crotona</pl>. <prn id='Q338948'>Milo</prn> won six victories for wrestling at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>, one of them among the boys; at <pl id='Q682558'>Pytho</pl> he won six among the men and one among the boys. He came to <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> to wrestle for the seventh time, but did not succeed in mastering <prn id='Q7804584'>Timasitheus</prn>, a fellow-citizen who was also a young man, and who refused, moreover, to come to close quarters with him. </p>
<p id='6.14.6'><b>6.14.6</b> It is further stated that <prn id='Q338948'>Milo</prn> carried his own statue into the <pl id='Q2400346'>Altis</pl>. His feats with the pomegranate and the quoit are also remembered by tradition. He would grasp a pomegranate so firmly that nobody could wrest it from him by force, and yet he did not damage it by pressure. He would stand upon a greased quoit, and make fools of those who charged him and tried to push him from the quoit. He used to perform also the following exhibition feats. </p>
<p id='6.14.7'><b>6.14.7</b> He would tie a cord round his forehead as though it were a ribbon or a crown. Holding his breath and filling with blood the veins on his head, he would break the cord by the strength of these veins. It is said that he would let down by his side his right arm from the shoulder to the elbow, and stretch out straight the arm below the elbow, turning the thumb upwards, while the other fingers lay in a row. In this position, then, the little finger was lowest, but nobody could bend it back by pressure. </p>
<p id='6.14.8'><b>6.14.8</b> They say that he was killed by wild beasts. The story has it that he came across in the land of <pl id='Q13526919'>Crotona</pl> a tree-trunk that was drying up; wedges were inserted to keep the trunk apart. <prn id='Q338948'>Milo</prn> in his pride thrust his hands into the trunk, the wedges slipped, and <prn id='Q338948'>Milo</prn> was held fast by the trunk until the <prn id='Q18498'>wolves</prn> — a beast that roves in vast packs in the land of <pl id='Q13526919'>Crotona</pl> — made him their prey. </p>
<p id='6.14.9'><b>6.14.9</b> Such was the fate that overtook <prn id='Q338948'>Milo</prn>. <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q403377'>Aeacides</prn>, who was king on the <pl id='Q2551754'>Thesprotian</pl> mainland and performed many remarkable deeds, as I have related in my account of the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, had his statue dedicated by <prn id='Q45805945'>Thrasybulus</prn> of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>. Beside <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn> is a little man holding flutes, carved in relief upon a slab. This man won <pl id='Q682558'>Pythian</pl> victories next after <prn id='Q3944390'>Sacadas</prn> of <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>. </p>

It is also clear that at the <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> Festival he fluted six times for the pentathlum. For these reasons the slab at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> was erected in honor of <prn id='Q11941764'>Pythocritus</prn>, with the inscription on it: “This is the monument of the flute-player <prn id='Q11941764'>Pythocritus</prn>, the son of CallinicuYY.

This statue was dedicated at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> by EumolpusYY, as he himself says, the grandson of Deicrates who married the sister of <prn id='Q179785'>Gorgias</prn>. </p>
<p id='6.17.8'><b>6.17.8</b> This <prn id='Q179785'>Gorgias</prn> was a son of Charmantides, and is said to have been the first to revive the study of rhetoric, which had been altogether neglected, in fact almost forgotten by mankind. They say that <prn id='Q179785'>Gorgias</prn> won great renown for his eloquence at the <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> assembly, and also when he accompanied <prn id='Q931271'>Tisias</prn> on an embassy to <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>. Yet <prn id='Q931271'>Tisias</prn> improved the art of rhetoric, in particular he wrote the most persuasive speech of his time to support the claim of a <pl id='Q4420718'>Syracusan</pl> woman to a property. </p>
<p id='6.17.9'><b>6.17.9</b> However, <prn id='Q179785'>Gorgias</prn> surpassed his fame at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>; indeed <prn id='Q456945'>Jason</prn>, the tyrant of <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessaly</pl>, placed him before <prn id='Q732715'>Polycrates</prn>, who was a shining light of the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> school. <prn id='Q179785'>Gorgias</prn>, they say, lived to be one hundred and five years old. <pl id='Q3830644'>Leontini</pl> was once laid waste by the <pl id='Q4420718'>Syracusans</pl>, but in my time was again inhabited. </p>
<p id='6.18.1'><b>6.18.1</b> There is also a bronze statue of <prn id='Q20010918'>Cratisthenes</prn> of <pl id='Q44112'>Cyrene</pl>, and on the chariot stand <prn id='Q165023'>Victory</prn> and <prn id='Q20010918'>Cratisthenes</prn> himself. It is thus plain that his victory was in the chariot-race. The story goes that <prn id='Q20010918'>Cratisthenes</prn> was the son of <prn id='Q20120438'>Mnaseas</prn> the runner, surnamed the Libyan by the Greeks. His offerings at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> are the work of <prn id='Q2705569'>Pythagoras</prn> of <pl id='Q3429952'>Rhegium</pl>. </p>
<p id='6.18.2'><b>6.18.2</b> Here too I remember discovering the statue of <prn id='Q221787'>Anaximenes</prn>, who wrote a universal history of ancient Greece, including the exploits of <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn> the son of <prn id='Q313907'>Amyntas</prn> and the subsequent deeds of <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn>. His honor at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> was due to the people of <pl id='Q1229422'>Lampsacus</pl>. <prn id='Q221787'>Anaximenes</prn> bequeathed to posterity the following anecdotes about himself. <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn>, no meek and mild person but a most passionate monarch, he circumvented by the following artifice. </p>
<p id='6.18.3'><b>6.18.3</b> The people of <pl id='Q1229422'>Lampsacus</pl> favoured the cause of the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl> king, or were suspected of doing so, and <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn>, boiling over with rage against them, threatened to treat them with utmost rigor. As their wives, their children, and their country itself were in great danger, they sent <prn id='Q221787'>Anaximenes</prn> to intercede for them, because he was known to <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn> himself and had been known to <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn> before him. <prn id='Q221787'>Anaximenes</prn> approached, and when <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn> learned for what cause he had come, they say that he swore by the gods of Greece, whom he named, that he would verily do the opposite of what <prn id='Q221787'>Anaximenes</prn> asked. </p>
<p id='6.18.4'><b>6.18.4</b> Thereupon <prn id='Q221787'>Anaximenes</prn> said, “Grant me, O king, this favour. Enslave the women and children of the people of <pl id='Q1229422'>Lampsacus</pl>, raze the whole city even to the ground, and burn the sanctuaries of their gods.” Such were his words; and <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn>, finding no way to counter the trick, and bound by the compulsion of his oath, unwillingly pardoned the people of <pl id='Q1229422'>Lampsacus</pl>. </p>
<p id='6.18.5'><b>6.18.5</b> <prn id='Q221787'>Anaximenes</prn> is also known to have retaliated on a personal enemy in a very clever but very ill-natured way. He had a natural aptitude for rhetoric and for imitating the style of rhetoricians. Having a quarrel with <prn id='Q4318'>Theopompus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q106515594'>Damasistratus</prn>, he wrote a treatise abusing <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> and <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> alike. He imitated the style of <prn id='Q4318'>Theopompus</prn> with perfect accuracy, inscribed his name upon the book and sent it round to the cities. Though <prn id='Q221787'>Anaximenes</prn> was the author of the treatise, hatred of <prn id='Q4318'>Theopompus</prn> grew throughout the length of Greece. </p>
<p id='6.18.6'><b>6.18.6</b> Moreover, <prn id='Q221787'>Anaximenes</prn> was the first to compose extemporary speeches, though I cannot believe that he was the author of the epic on <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn>. <prn id='Q7563949'>Sotades</prn> at the <prn id='Q57337790'>ninety-ninth Olympiad</prn> [384 BCE] was victorious in the long race and proclaimed a <pl id='Q4752820'>Cretan</pl>, as in fact he was. But at the next Olympiad [380 BCE] he made himself an <pl id='Q47611'>Ephesian</pl>, being bribed to do so by the <pl id='Q47611'>Ephesian</pl> people. For this act he was banished by the <pl id='Q4752820'>Cretans</pl>. </p>
<p id='6.18.7'><b>6.18.7</b> The first athletes to have their statues dedicated at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> were <prn id='Q23016423'>Praxidamas</prn> of <pl id='Q191082'>Aegina</pl>, victorious at boxing at the <prn id='Q57337735'>fifty-ninth Olympiad</prn> [544 BCE], and <prn id='Q20493342'>Rexibius</prn> the <pl id='Q3354839'>Opuntian</pl>, a successful pancratiast at the <prn id='Q57337738'>sixty-first Olympiad</prn> [536 BCE]. These statues stand near the pillar of <prn id='Q847890'>Oenomaus</prn>, and are made of wood, Rexibius of figwood and the <pl id='Q191082'>Aeginetan</pl> of cypress, and his statue is less decayed than the other. </p>
<p id='6.19.1'><b>6.19.1</b> There is in the <pl id='Q2400346'>Altis</pl> to the north of the <pl id='Q633572'>Heraeum</pl> a terrace of conglomerate, and behind it stretches Mount <pl id='Q1250184'>Cronios</pl>. On this terrace are the <pl id='Q7836783'>treasuries</pl>, just as at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> certain of the Greeks have made treasuries for <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>. There is at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> a treasury called the <pl id='Q2231808'>treasury</pl> of the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl>, dedicated by <prn id='Q11937048'>Myron</prn>, who was tyrant of <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl>. </p>
<p id='6.19.2'><b>6.19.2</b> <prn id='Q11937048'>Myron</prn> built it to commemorate a victory in the chariot-race at the <prn id='Q57337701'>thirty-third Olympiad</prn> [648 BCE]. In the <pl id='Q2231808'>treasury</pl> he made two chambers, one <prn id='Q192664'>Dorian</prn> and one in the <prn id='Q189548'>Ionic</prn> style. I saw that they were made of bronze; whether the bronze is <pl id='Q320416'>Tartessian</pl>, as the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> declare, I do not know. </p>
<p id='6.19.3'><b>6.19.3</b> They say that <pl id='Q14309'>Tartessus</pl> is a river in the land of the <pl id='Q1203967'>Iberians</pl>, running down into the sea by two mouths, and that between these two mouths lies a <pl id='Q320416'>city</pl> of the same name. The river, which is the largest in <pl id='Q1203967'>Iberia</pl>, and tidal, those of a later day called <pl id='Q14309'>Baetis</pl>, and there are some who think that <pl id='Q320416'>Tartessus</pl> was the ancient name of <prn id='Q5045811'>Carpia</prn>, a city of the <pl id='Q1203967'>Iberians</pl>. </p>
<p id='6.19.4'><b>6.19.4</b> On the smaller of the chambers at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> are inscriptions, which inform us that the weight of the bronze is five hundred talents, and that the dedicators were <prn id='Q11937048'>Myron</prn> and the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonian</pl> people. In this chamber are kept three quoits, being used for the contest of the pentathlum. There is also a bronze-plated shield, adorned with paintings on the inner side, and along with the shield are a helmet and greaves. An inscription on the armour says that they were dedicated by the <pl id='Q2358920'>Myanians</pl> as first-fruits to <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>. Various conjectures have been made as to who these <pl id='Q2358920'>Myanians</pl> were. </p>
<p id='6.19.5'><b>6.19.5</b> I happened to remember that <prn id='Q41683'>Thucydides</prn> in his history mentions various cities of the <pl id='Q3354839'>Locrians</pl> near <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl>, and among them the <pl id='Q2358920'>Myonians</pl>. So the <pl id='Q2358920'>Myanians</pl> on the shield are in my opinion the same folk as the <pl id='Q2358920'>Myonians</pl> on the <pl id='Q3354839'>Locrian</pl> mainland. The letters on the shield are a little distorted, a fault due to the antiquity of the votive offering. </p>
<p id='6.19.6'><b>6.19.6</b> There are placed here other offerings worthy to be recorded, the sword of <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn> with its hilt of gold, and the ivory horn of <prn id='Q107785'>Amaltheia</prn>, an offering of <prn id='Q210350'>Miltiades</prn> the son of <prn id='Q14278582'>Cimon</prn>, who was the first of his house to rule in the Thracian <pl id='Q192860'>Chersonesus</pl>. On the horn is an inscription in old <pl id='Q122443'>Attic</pl> characters: “To <prn id='Q106460486'>Olympian</prn> <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> was I dedicated by the men of <pl id='Q192860'>Chersonesus</pl> After they had taken the fortress of AratusYY. Their leader was <prn id='Q210350'>Miltiades</prn>.” There stands also a box-wood image of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> with its head plated with gold. The inscription says that it was dedicated by the <pl id='Q3836325'>Locrians</pl> who live near the Zephyrion Cape, and that the artist was <prn id='Q16587572'>Patrocles</prn> of <pl id='Q13526919'>Crotona</pl>, the son of CatillusYY. </p>
<p id='6.19.7'><b>6.19.7</b> Next to the <pl id='Q2231808'>treasury</pl> of the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl> is the <pl id='Q106953399'>treasury</pl> of the <pl id='Q6343'>Carthaginians</pl>, the work of <prn id='Q1651076'>Pothaeus</prn>, <prn id='Q581912'>Antiphilus</prn> and <prn id='Q16218374'>Megacles</prn>. In it are votive offerings — a huge image of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> and three linen breast-plates, dedicated by <prn id='Q468608'>Gelo</prn> and the <pl id='Q4420718'>Syracusans</pl> after overcoming the <pl id='Q41642'>Phoenicians</pl> in either a naval or a land battle. </p>

These too are of cedar-wood, and are works of <prn id='Q11951483'>Theocles</prn>, son of Hegylus. The inscription on the heavens says that his son helped him to make it. The <prn id='Q206187'>Hesperides</prn> (they were removed by the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>) were even in my time in the <pl id='Q633572'>Heraeum</pl>; the <pl id='Q106956826'>treasury</pl> was made for the <pl id='Q3567546'>Epidamnians</pl> by <prn id='Q106963283'>Pyrrhus</prn> and his sons LacratesYY and HermonYY. </p>
<p id='6.19.9'><b>6.19.9</b> The <pl id='Q220583'>Sybarites</pl> too built a <pl id='Q106956848'>treasury</pl> adjoining <pl id='Q106956846'>that</pl> of the <pl id='Q23725'>Byzantines</pl>. Those who have studied the history of <pl id='Q913582'>Italy</pl> and of the <pl id='Q913582'>Italian</pl> cities say that <pl id='Q3974286'>Lupiae</pl>, situated between <pl id='Q103155084'>Brundusium</pl> and Hydrus, has changed its name, and was Sybaris in ancient times.

<p id='6.19.12'><b>6.19.12</b> The <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarians</pl> who are neighbors of <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl> built a <pl id='Q96392534'>treasury</pl> and dedicated in it offerings, small cedar-wood figures inlaid with gold, representing the fight of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> with <prn id='Q391379'>Achelous</prn>.

<p id='6.20.3'><b>6.20.3</b> In the front part of the <pl id='Q107010633'>temple</pl>, for it is built in two parts, is an altar of <prn id='Q94066'>Eileithyia</prn> and an entrance for the public; in the inner part <prn id='Q1432941'>Sosipolis</prn> is worshipped, and no one may enter it except the woman who tends the god, and she must wrap her head and face in a white veil. Maidens and matrons wait in the sanctuary of <prn id='Q94066'>Eileithyia</prn> chanting a hymn; they burn all manner of incense to the god, but it is not the custom to pour libations of wine. An oath is taken by <prn id='Q1432941'>Sosipolis</prn> on the most important occasions. </p>
<p id='6.20.4'><b>6.20.4</b> The story is that when the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> had invaded the land of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>, and the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> were set in array against them, a woman came to the <pl id='Q6536845'>Elean</pl> generals, holding a baby to her breast, who said that she was the mother of the child but that she gave him, because of dreams, to fight for the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>. The <pl id='Q6536845'>Elean</pl> officers believed that the woman was to be trusted, and placed the child before the army naked. </p>
<p id='6.20.5'><b>6.20.5</b> When the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> came on, the child turned at once into a <prn id='Q2102'>snake</prn>. Thrown into disorder at the sight, the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> turned and fled, and were attacked by the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>, who won a very famous victory, and so call the god <prn id='Q1432941'>Sosipolis</prn>. On the spot where after the battle the <prn id='Q2102'>snake</prn> seemed to them to go into the ground they made the <pl id='Q107010633'>sanctuary</pl>. With him the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> resolved to worship <prn id='Q94066'>Eileithyia</prn> also, because this goddess to help them brought her son forth unto men. </p>
<p id='6.20.6'><b>6.20.6</b> The tomb of the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> who were killed in the battle is on the hill across the <pl id='Q647970'>Cladeus</pl> to the west. Near to the <pl id='Q107010633'>sanctuary</pl> of <prn id='Q94066'>Eileithyia</prn> are the remains of the <pl id='Q107031180'>sanctuary</pl> of <prn id='Q423622'>Heavenly Aphrodite</prn>, and there too they sacrifice upon the altars. </p>
<p id='6.20.7'><b>6.20.7</b> There is within the <pl id='Q2400346'>Altis</pl> by the processional entrance the <pl id='Q1619976'>Hippodameion</pl>, as it is called, about a quarter of an acre of ground surrounded by a wall. Into it once every year the women may enter, who sacrifice to <prn id='Q328354'>Hippodameia</prn>, and do her honor in other ways. The story is that <prn id='Q328354'>Hippodameia</prn> withdrew to <pl id='Q502897'>Midea</pl> in <pl id='Q12649101'>Argolis</pl>, because <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn> was very angry with her over the death of <prn id='Q1043413'>Chrysippus</prn>. The <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> declare that subsequently, because of an oracle, they brought the bones of <prn id='Q328354'>Hippodameia</prn> to <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>. </p>
<p id='6.20.8'><b>6.20.8</b> At the end of the statues which they made from the fines levied on athletes, there is the entrance called the Krypte (Hidden) Entrance. Through it <prn id='Q1491624'>Hellanodikai</prn> and competitors are wont to enter the <pl id='Q4357227'>stadium</pl>. Now the <pl id='Q4357227'>stadium</pl> is an embankment of earth, and on it is a seat for the presidents of the games. Opposite the <prn id='Q1491624'>Hellanodikai</prn> is an altar of white marble; </p>
<p id='6.20.9'><b>6.20.9</b> seated on this altar a woman looks on at the <prn id='Q188468'>Olympic games</prn>, the priestess of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> <prn id='Q1061538'>Chamyne</prn>, which office the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> bestow from time to time on different women. Maidens are not debarred from looking on at the games. At the end of the <pl id='Q4357227'>stadium</pl>, where is the starting-place for the runners, there is, the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> say, the <pl id='Q107031178'>tomb</pl> of <prn id='Q272047'>Endymion</prn>. </p>
<p id='6.20.10'><b>6.20.10</b> When you have passed beyond the <pl id='Q4357227'>stadium</pl>, at the point where the <prn id='Q1491624'>Hellanodikai</prn> sit, is a place set apart for the horse-races, and also the <pl id='Q19602775'>starting-place</pl> for the <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn>. The starting-place is in the shape of the prow of a ship, and its prow is turned towards the course. At the point where the prow adjoins the <pl id='Q107031177'>Stoa</pl> of <prn id='Q394350'>Agnaptus</prn> it broadens and a bronze <prn id='Q7369'>dolphin</prn> on a rod has been made at the very point of the ram. </p>
<p id='6.20.11'><b>6.20.11</b> Each side of the <place id='376216BOHi'>starting-place</place> is more than four hundred feet in length, and in the sides are built stalls. These stalls are assigned by lot to those who enter for the races. Before the chariots or race-<prn id='Q726'>horses</prn> is stretched a cord as a barrier. An altar of unburnt brick, plastered on the outside, is made at every Olympiad as near as possible to the center of the prow, </p>
<p id='6.20.12'><b>6.20.12</b> and a bronze <prn id='Q2092297'>eagle</prn> stands on the altar with his wings stretched out to the fullest extent. The man appointed to start the racing sets in motion the mechanism in the altar, and then the <prn id='Q2092297'>eagle</prn> has been made to jump upwards, so as to become visible to the spectators, while the <prn id='Q7369'>dolphin</prn> falls to the ground. </p>
<p id='6.20.13'><b>6.20.13</b> First on either side the barriers are withdrawn by the porch of <prn id='Q394350'>Agnaptus</prn>, and the <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn> standing thereby run off first. As they run they reach those to whom the second station has been allotted, and then are withdrawn the barriers at the second station. The same thing happens to all the <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn> in turn, until at the ram of the prow they are all abreast. After this it is left to the charioteers to display their skill and the <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn> their speed. </p>
<p id='6.20.14'><b>6.20.14</b> It was <prn id='Q88464846'>Cleoetas</prn> who originally devised the method of starting, and he appears to have been proud of the discovery, as on the statue at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> he wrote the inscription: “Who first invented the method of starting the <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn> at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>, He made me, <prn id='Q88464846'>Cleoetas</prn> the son of <prn id='Q666599'>Aristocles</prn>.” It is said that after <prn id='Q88464846'>Cleoetas</prn> some further device was added to the mechanism by AristeideYY. </p>
<p id='6.20.15'><b>6.20.15</b> The <pl id='Q19602775'>race-course</pl> has one side longer than the other, and on the longer side, which is a bank, there stands, at the passage through the bank, <pl id='Q107031181'>Taraxippus</pl>, the terror of the <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn>. It has the shape of a round altar, and as they run along the <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn> are seized, as soon as they reach this point, by a great fear without any apparent reason. The fear leads to disorder; the chariots generally crash and the charioteers are injured. Consequently the charioteers offer sacrifice, and pray that <prn id='Q770627'>Taraxippus</prn> may show himself propitious to them. </p>
<p id='6.20.16'><b>6.20.16</b> The Greeks differ in their view of <pl id='Q107031181'>Taraxippus</pl>. Some hold that it is the tomb of an original inhabitant who was skilled in horsemanship; they call him Olenius, and say that after him was named the <pl id='Q11939304'>Olenian</pl> rock in the land of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>. Others say that <prn id='Q12875832'>Dameon</prn>, son of <prn id='Q3624035'>Phlius</prn>, who took part in the expedition of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> against <prn id='Q207663'>Augeas</prn> and the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>, was killed along with his charger by <prn id='Q3699000'>Cteatus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q423424'>Actor</prn>, and that man and <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn> were buried in the same tomb. </p>
<p id='6.20.17'><b>6.20.17</b> There is also a story that <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn> made here an empty mound in honor of <prn id='Q615912'>Myrtilus</prn>, and sacrificed to him in an effort to calm the anger of the murdered man, naming the mound <prn id='Q770627'>Taraxippus</prn> (Frightener of <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn>) because the mares of <prn id='Q847890'>Oenomaus</prn> were frightened by the trick of <prn id='Q615912'>Myrtilus</prn>. Some say that it is <prn id='Q847890'>Oenomaus</prn> himself who harms the racers in the course. I have also heard some attach the blame to <prn id='Q2647407'>Alcathus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q1178970'>Porthaon</prn>. Killed by <prn id='Q847890'>Oenomaus</prn> because he wooed <prn id='Q328354'>Hippodameia</prn>, <prn id='Q2647407'>Alcathus</prn>, they say, here got his portion of earth; having been unsuccessful on the course, he is a spiteful and hostile deity to chariot-drivers. </p>
<p id='6.20.18'><b>6.20.18</b> A man of <pl id='Q11768'>Egypt</pl> said that <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn> received something from <prn id='Q242835'>Amphion</prn> the <pl id='Q11225429'>Theban</pl> and buried it where is what they call <pl id='Q107031181'>Taraxippus</pl>, adding that it was the buried thing which frightened the mares of <prn id='Q847890'>Oenomaus</prn>, as well as those of every charioteer since. This <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptian</pl> thought that <prn id='Q242835'>Amphion</prn> and the Thracian <prn id='Q174353'>Orpheus</prn> were clever magicians, and that it was through their enchantments that the beasts came to <prn id='Q174353'>Orpheus</prn>, and the stones came to <prn id='Q242835'>Amphion</prn> for the building of the wall. The most probable of the stories in my opinion makes <prn id='Q770627'>Taraxippus</prn> a surname of  <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> <prn id='Q20100719'>Hippios</prn>. </p>
<p id='6.20.19'><b>6.20.19</b> There is another <prn id='Q770627'>Taraxippus</prn> at the <pl id='Q16600469'>Isthmus</pl>, namely <prn id='Q1232714'>Glaucus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q102561'>Sisyphus</prn>. They say that he was killed by his <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn>, when <prn id='Q416384'>Acastus</prn> held his contests in honor of his father. At <pl id='Q748108'>Nemea</pl> of the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> there was no hero who harmed the <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn>, but above the turning-point of the chariots rose a rock, red in color, and the flash from it terrified the <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn>, just as though it had been fire. But the <prn id='Q770627'>Taraxippus</prn> at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> is much worse for terrifying the <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn>. On one <pl id='Q19602775'>turning-post</pl> is a bronze statue of <prn id='Q328354'>Hippodameia</prn> carrying a ribbon, and about to crown <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn> with it for his victory. </p>
<p id='6.21.1'><b>6.21.1</b> The other side of the course is not a bank of earth but a low hill. At the foot of the hill has been built a <pl id='Q97446599'>sanctuary</pl> to <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> surnamed <prn id='Q1061538'>Chamyne</prn>. Some are of opinion that the name is old, signifying that here the earth gaped for the chariot of <prn id='Q41410'>Hades</prn> and then closed up once more. Others say that <prn id='Q106255950'>Chamynus</prn> was a man of <pl id='Q922329'>Pisa</pl> who opposed <prn id='Q16509266'>Pantaleon</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q106114419'>Omphalion</prn> and despot at <pl id='Q922329'>Pisa</pl>, when he plotted to revolt from <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>; <prn id='Q16509266'>Pantaleon</prn>, they say, put him to death, and from his property was built the <pl id='Q97446599'>sanctuary</pl> to <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>. </p>
<p id='6.21.2'><b>6.21.2</b> In place of the old images of <prn id='Q45967'>Kore</prn> and of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> new ones of <pl id='Q1125206'>Pentelic</pl> marble were dedicated by <prn id='Q311879'>Herodes</prn> the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl>. In the <pl id='Q25535896'>gymnasium</pl> at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> it is customary for pentathletes and runners to practise, and in the open has been made a basement of stone. Originally there stood on the basement a trophy to commemorate a victory over the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl>. There is also another enclosure, less than this, to the left of the entrance to the <pl id='Q25535896'>gymnasium</pl>, and the athletes have their wrestling-schools here. Adjoining the wall of the eastern porch of the <pl id='Q25535896'>gymnasium</pl> are the dwellings of the athletes, turned towards the southwest. </p>
<p id='6.21.3'><b>6.21.3</b> On the other side of the <pl id='Q647970'>Cladeus</pl> is the <pl id='Q107031179'>tomb</pl> of <prn id='Q847890'>Oenomaus</prn>, a mound of earth with a stone wall built round it, and above the tomb are ruins of buildings in which <prn id='Q847890'>Oenomaus</prn> is said to have stabled his mares. The boundaries which now separate <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl> and <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> originally separated <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl> from <pl id='Q922329'>Pisa</pl>, and are thus situated. On crossing the river <pl id='Q3555227'>Erymanthus</pl> at what is called the ridge of <prn id='Q3474266'>Saurus</prn> are the <pl id='Q107031186'>tomb</pl> of <prn id='Q3474266'>Saurus</prn> and a <pl id='Q107031184'>sanctuary</pl> of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, now in ruins. The story is that <prn id='Q3474266'>Saurus</prn> used to do mischief to travellers and to dwellers in the neighborhood until he received his punishment at the hands of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>. </p>
<p id='6.21.4'><b>6.21.4</b> At this ridge which has the same name as the robber, a river, falling into the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl> from the south, just opposite the <pl id='Q3555227'>Erymanthus</pl>, is the boundary between the land of <pl id='Q922329'>Pisa</pl> and <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl>; it is called the <pl id='Q15148060'>Diagon</pl>. Forty stades beyond the ridge of <prn id='Q3474266'>Saurus</prn> is a <pl id='Q107031185'>temple</pl> of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>, surnamed Demaenetus1 after the founder. It too is in ruins.

<p id='6.21.6'><b>6.21.6</b> In this district is a hill rising to a sharp peak, on which are the ruins of the city of <pl id='Q5505071'>Phrixa</pl>, as well as a temple of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> surnamed <pl id='Q1481525'>Cydonian</pl>. This temple is not entire, but the altar is still there. The <pl id='Q107031182'>sanctuary</pl> was founded for the goddess, they say, by <prn id='Q16663935'>Clymenus</prn>, a descendant of <pl id='Q83659'>Idaean</pl> <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, and he came from <pl id='Q1481525'>Cydonia</pl> in <pl id='Q4752820'>Crete</pl> and from the river A923.

<p id='6.21.7'><b>6.21.7</b> Going on from this point you come to the water of <pl id='Q15148064'>Parthenia</pl>, and by the river is the grave of the mares of <prn id='Q31320071'>Marmax</prn>. The story has it that this <prn id='Q31320071'>Marmax</prn> was the first suitor of <prn id='Q328354'>Hippodameia</prn> to arrive, and that he was killed by <prn id='Q847890'>Oenomaus</prn> before the others; that the names of his mares were PartheniaYY and Eripha; that <prn id='Q847890'>Oenomaus</prn> slew the mares after <prn id='Q31320071'>Marmax</prn>, but granted burial to them also, and that the river received the name <pl id='Q15148064'>Parthenia</pl> from the mare of <prn id='Q31320071'>Marmax</prn>. </p>
<p id='6.21.8'><b>6.21.8</b> There is another river called <pl id='Q16327010'>Harpinates</pl>, and not far from the river are, among the other ruins of a city <pl id='Q5663572'>Harpina</pl>, its altars.

Now <prn id='Q847890'>Oenomaus</prn>, they say, laid them in the ground near one another with no token of respect. But afterwards <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn> raised a high monument to them all, to honor them and to please <prn id='Q328354'>Hippodameia</prn>. I think too that <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn> wanted a memorial to tell posterity the number and character of the men vanquished by <prn id='Q847890'>Oenomaus</prn> before <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn> himself conquered him. </p>

The people of <pl id='Q922329'>Pisa</pl> brought of themselves disaster on their own heads by their hostility to the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>, and by their keenness to preside over the <prn id='Q188468'>Olympic games</prn> instead of them. At the <prn id='Q57337665'>eighth Olympiad</prn> [748 BCE] they brought in <prn id='Q29529739'>Pheidon</prn> of <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>, the most overbearing of the Greek tyrants, and held the games along with him, while at the <prn id='Q57337702'>thirty-fourth Olympiad</prn> [644 BCE] the people of <pl id='Q922329'>Pisa</pl>, with their king <prn id='Q724307'>Pantaleon</prn> the son of <prn id='Q106114419'>Omphalion</prn>, collected an army from the neighborhood, and held the <prn id='Q188468'>Olympic games</prn> instead of the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>. </p>
<p id='6.22.3'><b>6.22.3</b> These Olympiads, as well as the hundred and fourth, which was held by the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl>, are called “Non-Olympiads” by the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>, who do not include them in a list of Olympiads. At the <prn id='Q57337720'>forty-eighth Olympiad</prn> [588 BCE], <prn id='Q1158742'>Damophon</prn> the son of <prn id='Q16509266'>Pantaleon</prn> gave the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> reasons for suspecting that he was intriguing against them, but when they invaded the land of <pl id='Q922329'>Pisa</pl> with an army he persuaded them by prayers and oaths to return quietly home again. </p>
<p id='6.22.4'><b>6.22.4</b> When <prn id='Q106259489'>Pyrrhus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q16509266'>Pantaleon</prn>, succeeded his brother <prn id='Q1158742'>Damophon</prn> as king, the people of <pl id='Q922329'>Pisa</pl> of their own accord made war against <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>, and were joined in their revolt from the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> by the people of <pl id='Q111086985'>Macistus</pl> and <pl id='Q733291'>Scillus</pl>, which are in <pl id='Q472032'>Triphylia</pl>, and by the people of <pl id='Q3565717'>Dyspontium</pl>, another vassal community. The last were closely related to the people of <pl id='Q922329'>Pisa</pl>, and it was a tradition of theirs that their founder had been <prn id='Q60219568'>Dysponteus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q847890'>Oenomaus</prn>. It was the fate of <pl id='Q922329'>Pisa</pl>, and of all her allies, to be destroyed by the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>. </p>
<p id='6.22.5'><b>6.22.5</b> Of <pl id='Q7263101'>Pylus</pl> in the land of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> the ruins are to be seen on the mountain road from <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> to <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>, the distance between <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> and <pl id='Q7263101'>Pylus</pl> being eighty stades. This <pl id='Q7263101'>Pylus</pl> was founded, as I have already said, by a <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarian</pl> called <prn id='Q3411223'>Pylon</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q2980787'>Cleson</prn>. Destroyed by <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> and refounded by the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>, the city was doomed in time to be without inhabitants. Beside it the river <pl id='Q15135283'>Ladon</pl> flows into the <pl id='Q1233866'>Peneius</pl>. </p>
<p id='6.22.6'><b>6.22.6</b> The <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> declare that there is a reference to this <pl id='Q7263101'>Pylus</pl> in the passage of <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>: “And he was descended from the river <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl>, that in broad stream flows through the land of the <pl id='Q7263101'>Pylians</pl>.” The <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> convinced me that they are right. For the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl> does flow through this district, and the passage cannot refer to another Pylus. For the land of the Pylians over against the island <pl id='Q1303524'>Sphacteria</pl> simply cannot in the nature of things be crossed by the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl>, and, moreover, we know of no city in <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl> named Pylus. </p>
<p id='6.22.7'><b>6.22.7</b> Distant from <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> about fifty stades is <pl id='Q26721041'>Heracleia</pl>, a village of the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>, and beside it is a river <pl id='Q211852'>Cytherus</pl>. A spring flows into the river, and there is a <pl id='Q107031254'>sanctuary</pl> of nymphs near the spring. Individually the names of the nymphs are Calliphaeia, Synallasis, Pegaea and Iasis, but their common surname is the <prn id='Q15820363'>Ionides</prn>. Those who bathe in the spring are cured of all sorts of aches and pains. They say that the nymphs are named after <prn id='Q106253142'>Ion</prn>, the son of Gargettus, who migrated to this place from <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>. </p>
<p id='6.22.8'><b>6.22.8</b> If you wish to go to <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> through the plain, you will travel one hundred and twenty stades to <pl id='Q12880141'>Letrini</pl>, and one hundred and eighty from <pl id='Q12880141'>Letrini</pl> to <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>. Originally <pl id='Q12880141'>Letrini</pl> was a town, and <prn id='Q106262972'>Letreus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn> was its founder; but in my time were left a few buildings, with an image of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> <prn id='Q21153616'>Alpheiaea</prn> in a <pl id='Q107031188'>temple</pl>. </p>
<p id='6.22.9'><b>6.22.9</b> Legend has it that the goddess received the surname for the following reason. <prn id='Q911084'>Alpheius</prn> fell in love with <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, and then, realizing that persuasive entreaties would not win the goddess as his bride, he dared to plot violence against her. <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> was holding at <pl id='Q12880141'>Letrini</pl> an all-night revel with the nymphs who were her playmates, and to it came <prn id='Q911084'>Alpheius</prn>. But <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> had a suspicion of the plot of <prn id='Q911084'>Alpheius</prn>, and smeared with mud her own face and the faces of the nymphs with her. So <prn id='Q911084'>Alpheius</prn>, when he joined the throng, could not distinguish <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> from the others, and, not being able to pick her out, went away without bringing off his attempt. </p>
<p id='6.22.10'><b>6.22.10</b> The people of <pl id='Q12880141'>Letrini</pl> called the goddess Alpheian because of the love of <prn id='Q911084'>Alpheius</prn> for her. But the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>, who from the first had been friends of <pl id='Q12880141'>Letrini</pl>, transferred to that city the worship of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> <prn id='Q60297614'>Elaphiaea</prn> established amongst themselves, and held that they were worshipping <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> <prn id='Q21153616'>Alpheiaea</prn>, and so in time the Alpheiaean goddess came to be named <prn id='Q60297614'>Elaphiaea</prn>. </p>
<p id='6.22.11'><b>6.22.11</b> The <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>, I think, called <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> <prn id='Q60297614'>Elaphiaea</prn> from the hunting of the deer (elaphos). But they themselves say that <prn id='Q60297640'>Elaphius</prn> was the name of a native woman by whom <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> was reared. About six stades distant from <pl id='Q12880141'>Letrini</pl> is a lake that never dries up, being just about three stades across. </p>
<p id='6.23.1'><b>6.23.1</b> One of the noteworthy things in <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> is an old <pl id='Q107031194'>gymnasium</pl>. In this gymnasium the athletes are wont to go through the training through which they must pass before going to <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>. High plane-trees grow between the tracks inside a wall. The whole of this enclosure is called Xystus, because an exercise of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q206214'>Amphitryon</prn>, was to scrape up (anaxuein) each day all the thistles that grew there. </p>
<p id='6.23.2'><b>6.23.2</b> The track for the competing runners, called by the natives the Sacred Track, is separate from that on which the runners and pentathletes practise. In the <pl id='Q107031194'>gymnasium</pl> is the place called Plethrium. In it the <prn id='Q1491624'>Hellanodikai</prn> match the competitors according to age and skill; it is for wrestling that they match them. </p>
<p id='6.23.3'><b>6.23.3</b> There are also in the <pl id='Q107031194'>gymnasium</pl> altars of the gods, of <pl id='Q83659'>Idaean</pl> <prn id='Q107040833'>Heracles</prn>, surnamed <prn id='Q107040833'>Parastates</prn> (Standing By), of <prn id='Q121973'>Eros</prn>, of the deity called by <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> and <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> alike <prn id='Q572133'>Anteros</prn> (love returned), of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> and of her daughter. <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn> has no altar, only a cenotaph raised to him because of an oracle. On an appointed day at the beginning of the festival, when the course of the sun is sinking towards the west, the <pl id='Q6536845'>Elean</pl> women do honor to <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn>, especially by bewailing him. </p>
<p id='6.23.4'><b>6.23.4</b> There is another enclosed gymnasium, but smaller, adjoining the larger one and called Square because of its shape. Here the athletes practise wrestling, and here, when they have no more wrestling to do, they are matched in contests with the softer gloves. There is also dedicated here one of the images made in honor of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> out of the fines imposed upon <prn id='Q106264700'>Sosander</prn> of Smyrna and upon <prn id='Q20871651'>Polyctor</prn> of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>. </p>
<p id='6.23.5'><b>6.23.5</b> There is also a third enclosed gymnasium, called <prn id='Q106996700'>Maltho</prn> from the softness of its floor, and reserved for the youths for the whole time of the festival. In a corner of the <prn id='Q106996700'>Maltho</prn> is a bust of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> as far as the shoulders, and in one of the wrestling-schools is a relief showing <prn id='Q121973'>Eros</prn> and <prn id='Q572133'>Anteros</prn>, as he is called. <prn id='Q121973'>Eros</prn> holds a palm-branch, and <prn id='Q572133'>Anteros</prn> is trying to take the palm from him. </p>
<p id='6.23.6'><b>6.23.6</b> On each side of the entrance to the <prn id='Q106996700'>Maltho</prn> stands an image of a boy boxer. He was by birth, so the Guardian of the Laws at <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> told me, from <pl id='Q87'>Alexandria</pl> beyond the island <pl id='Q43244'>Pharos</pl>, and his name was <prn id='Q21704621'>Sarapion</prn>; arriving at <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> when the townsfolk were suffering from famine he supplied them with food. For this reason these honors were paid him here. The time of his crown at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> and of his benefaction to the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> was the <prn id='Q57337943'>two hundred and seventeenth Olympiad</prn> [89 CE]. </p>
<p id='6.23.7'><b>6.23.7</b> In this gymnasium is also the <pl id='Q6536845'>Elean</pl> bouleuterion (council house), where take place exhibitions of extempore speeches and recitations of written works of all kinds. It is called Lalichmium, after the man who dedicated it. About it are dedicated shields, which are for show and not made to be used in war. </p>
<p id='6.23.8'><b>6.23.8</b> The way from the gymnasium to the baths passes through the Street of Silence and beside the <pl id='Q107031199'>sanctuary</pl> of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> <prn id='Q107012410'>Philomeirax</prn>. The goddess is so surnamed because she is neighbor to the gymnasium; the street received, they say, the name of Silence for the following reason. Men of the army of <prn id='Q575252'>Oxylus</prn> were sent to spy out what was happening in <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>. On the way they exhorted each other, when they should be near the wall, themselves to keep a strict silence, but to listen attentively if perchance they might learn aught from the people in the town. These men by this street reached the town unobserved, and after hearing all they wished they went back again to the <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolians</pl>. So the street received its name from the silence of the spies. </p>
<p id='6.24.1'><b>6.24.1</b> One of the two ways from the gymnasium leads to the <pl id='Q106996940'>agora</pl>, and to what is called the <pl id='Q107031195'>Hellanodikaion</pl>; it is above the <pl id='Q107031198'>grave</pl> of <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn>, and by it the <prn id='Q1491624'>Hellanodikai</prn> are wont to go to the gymnasium. They enter before sunrise to match the runners, and at midday for the pentathlum and for such contests as are called heavy. </p>
<p id='6.24.2'><b>6.24.2</b> The <pl id='Q106996940'>agora</pl> of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> is not after the fashion of the cities of <pl id='Q620874'>Ionia</pl> and of the Greek cities near <pl id='Q620874'>Ionia</pl>; it is built in the older manner, with porticoes separated from each other and with streets through them. The modern name of the <pl id='Q106996940'>agora</pl> is Hippodromus, and the natives train their <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn> there. Of the porticoes the southern is in the <prn id='Q192664'>Doric</prn> style, and it is divided by the pillars into three parts. In it the <prn id='Q1491624'>Hellanodikai</prn> generally spend the day. </p>
<p id='6.24.3'><b>6.24.3</b> At the pillars they also cause altars to be made to <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, and in the open <pl id='Q106996940'>agora</pl> are the altars, in number not many; for, their construction being improvised, they are without difficulty taken to pieces. As you enter the <pl id='Q106996940'>agora</pl> at this portico the <pl id='Q107031195'>Hellanodikaion</pl> is on your left, parallel to the end of the portico. What separates it from the <pl id='Q106996940'>agora</pl> is a street. In this <pl id='Q107031195'>Hellanodikaion</pl> dwell for ten consecutive months the <prn id='Q1491624'>Hellanodikai</prn> elect, who are instructed by the Nomophylakes (Guardians of the Law) as to their duties at the festival. </p>
<p id='6.24.4'><b>6.24.4</b> Near to the stoa with the <pl id='Q107031195'>Hellanodikaion</pl> is another <pl id='Q107031196'>stoa</pl>, between the two being one street. The <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> call it the <pl id='Q107031196'>Corcyrean</pl>, because, they say, the <pl id='Q3693378'>Corcyreans</pl> landed in their country and carried off part of the booty, but they themselves took many times as much booty from the land of the <pl id='Q3693378'>Corcyreans</pl>, and built the stoa from the tithe of the spoils. </p>
<p id='6.24.5'><b>6.24.5</b> The <pl id='Q107031196'>stoa</pl> is in the <prn id='Q192664'>Doric</prn> style and double, having its pillars both on the side towards the <pl id='Q106996940'>agora</pl> and on the side away from it. Down the center of it the roof is supported, not by pillars, but by a wall, beside which on either side have been dedicated statues. On the side of the <pl id='Q107031196'>stoa</pl> towards the <pl id='Q106996940'>agora</pl> stands a statue of <prn id='Q192313'>Pyrrhon</prn>, son of Pistocrates, a sophist who never brought himself to make a definite admission on any matter. The <pl id='Q107031197'>tomb</pl> also of <prn id='Q192313'>Pyrrhon</prn> is not far from the town of the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>. The name of the place is <prn id='Q60791311'>Petra</prn>, and it is said that <prn id='Q60791311'>Petra</prn> was a deme in ancient times. </p>
<p id='6.24.6'><b>6.24.6</b> The most notable things that the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> have in the open part of the <pl id='Q106996940'>agora</pl> are a <pl id='Q107031201'>temple</pl> and image of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> Akesios (Healer). The meaning of the name would appear to be exactly the same as that of <prn id='Q4721374'>Alexikakos</prn> (Averter of Evil), the name current among the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>. In another part are the stone images of Helios and Selene (sun and moon); from the head of the moon project horns, from the head of the sun, his rays. There is also a <pl id='Q107031200'>sanctuary</pl> to the <prn id='Q184353'>Graces</prn>; the images are of wood, with their clothes gilded, while their faces, hands and feet are of white marble. One of them holds a rose, the middle one a knucklebone (or die), and the third a small branch of myrtle. </p>
<p id='6.24.7'><b>6.24.7</b> The reason for their holding these things may be guessed to be this. The rose and the myrtle are sacred to <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> and connected with the story of <prn id='Q163920'>Adonis</prn>, while the <prn id='Q184353'>Graces</prn> are of all deities the nearest related to <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>. As for the knucklebone, it is the plaything of youths and maidens, who have nothing of the ugliness of old age. On the right of the <prn id='Q184353'>Graces</prn> is an image of <prn id='Q121973'>Eros</prn>, standing on the same pedestal. </p>
<p id='6.24.8'><b>6.24.8</b> Here there is also a <pl id='Q107031206'>temple</pl> of <prn id='Q464091'>Silenus</prn>, which is sacred to <prn id='Q464091'>Silenus</prn> alone, and not to him in common with <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>. <prn id='Q2391464'>Methe</prn> (Drunkenness) is offering him wine in a cup. That the <prn id='Q464091'>Silenuses</prn> are a mortal race you may infer especially from their graves, for there is a tomb of a <prn id='Q464091'>Silenus</prn> in the land of the <prn id='Q7325'>Hebrews</prn>, and of another at <pl id='Q18986'>Pergamus</pl>. </p>
<p id='6.24.9'><b>6.24.9</b> In the <pl id='Q106996940'>agora</pl> of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> I saw something else, a low structure in the form of a temple. It has no walls, the roof being supported by pillars made of oak. The natives agree that it is a tomb, but they do not remember whose it is. If the old man I asked spoke the truth, it would be the tomb of <prn id='Q575252'>Oxylus</prn>. </p>
<p id='6.24.10'><b>6.24.10</b> There is also in the <pl id='Q106996940'>agora</pl> a building for the women called the Sixteen, where they weave the robe for <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn>. Adjoining the <pl id='Q106996940'>agora</pl> is an old <pl id='Q107031203'>temple</pl> surrounded by pillars; the roof has fallen down, and I found no image in the temple. It is dedicated to the Roman emperors. </p>
<p id='6.25.1'><b>6.25.1</b> Behind the <pl id='Q107031196'>stoa</pl> built from the spoils of <pl id='Q3693378'>Corcyra</pl> is a <pl id='Q107031202'>temple</pl> of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>, the precinct being in the open, not far from the temple. The goddess in the <pl id='Q107031202'>temple</pl> they call Heavenly; she is of ivory and gold, the work of <prn id='Q177302'>Pheidias</prn>, and she stands with one foot upon a tortoise. The precinct of the other <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> is surrounded by a wall, and within the precinct has been made a basement, upon which sits a bronze image of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> upon a bronze he-<prn id='Q2934'>goat</prn>. It is a work of <prn id='Q309579'>Scopas</prn>, and the <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> is named Common. The meaning of the tortoise and of the he-<prn id='Q2934'>goat</prn> I leave to those who care to guess. </p>
<p id='6.25.2'><b>6.25.2</b> The sacred enclosure of <prn id='Q41410'>Hades</prn> and its <pl id='Q107031204'>temple</pl> (for the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> have these among their possessions) are opened once every year, but not even on this occasion is anybody permitted to enter except the priest. The following is the reason why the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> worship <prn id='Q41410'>Hades</prn>; they are the only men we know of so to do. It is said that, when <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> was leading an expedition against <pl id='Q7263101'>Pylus</pl> in <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>, <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> was one of his allies. Now among those who came to fight on the side of the <pl id='Q7263101'>Pylians</pl> was <prn id='Q41410'>Hades</prn>, because of his enmity toward <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> and being held in honor at <pl id='Q7263101'>Pylus</pl>. </p>
<p id='6.25.3'><b>6.25.3</b> <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> is quoted in support of the story, who says in the <prn id='Q8275'>Iliad</prn>: <br>“And among them huge <prn id='Q41410'>Hades</prn> suffered a wound from a swift arrow, <br>When the same man, the son of aegis-bearing <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, <br>Hit him in <pl id='Q7263101'>Pylus</pl> among the dead, and gave him over to pains.” <br>If in the expedition of <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn> and <prn id='Q171839'>Menelaus</prn> against <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl> <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> was according to <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> an ally of the Greeks, it cannot be unnatural for the same poet to hold that <prn id='Q41410'>Hades</prn> helped the <pl id='Q7263101'>Pylians</pl>. At any rate it was in the belief that the god was their friend but the enemy of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> that the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> made the <pl id='Q107031204'>sanctuary</pl> for him. The reason why they are wont to open it only once each year is, I suppose, because men too go down only once to <pl id='Q1521549'>Hades</pl>. </p>
<p id='6.25.4'><b>6.25.4</b> The <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> have also a <pl id='Q107031207'>sanctuary</pl> of <prn id='Q213440'>Fortune</prn>. In a portico of the sanctuary has been dedicated a colossal image, made of gilded wood except the face, hands and feet, which are of white marble. Here <prn id='Q1432941'>Sosipolis</prn> too is worshipped in a small shrine on the left of the <pl id='Q107031207'>sanctuary</pl> of <prn id='Q213440'>Fortune</prn>. The god is painted according to his appearance in a dream: in age a boy, wrapped in a star-spangled robe, and in one hand holding the horn of <prn id='Q107785'>Amaltheia</prn>. </p>
<p id='6.25.5'><b>6.25.5</b> In the most thickly-populated part of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> is a statue of bronze no taller than a tall man; it represents a beardless youth with his legs crossed, leaning with both hands upon a spear. They cast about it a garment of wool, one of flax and one of fine linen. </p>
<p id='6.25.6'><b>6.25.6</b> This image was said to be of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, and to have been worshipped in ancient times at <pl id='Q3558588'>Samicum</pl> in <pl id='Q472032'>Triphylia</pl>. Transferred to <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> it received still greater honor, but the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> call it Satrap and not <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, having learned the name Satrap, which is a surname of <prn id='Q849438'>Corybas</prn>, after the enlargement of <pl id='Q133123'>Patrae</pl>. </p>
<p id='6.26.1'><b>6.26.1</b> Between the <pl id='Q106996940'>agora</pl> and the <prn id='Q107477417'>Menius</prn> is an old theater and a shrine of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>. The image is the work of <prn id='Q105290'>Praxiteles</prn>. Of the gods the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> worship <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> with the greatest reverence, and they assert that the god attends their festival, the <prn id='Q106113886'>Thyia</prn>. The <pl id='Q107031205'>place</pl> where they hold the festival they name the <prn id='Q106113886'>Thyia</prn> is about eight stades from the city. Three pots are brought into the building by the priests and set down empty in the presence of the citizens and of any strangers who may chance to be in the country. The doors of the building are sealed by the priests themselves and by any others who may be so inclined. </p>
<p id='6.26.2'><b>6.26.2</b> On the morrow they are allowed to examine the seals, and on going into the building they find the pots filled with wine. I did not myself arrive at the time of the festival, but the most respected <pl id='Q6536845'>Elean</pl> citizens, and with them strangers also, swore that what I have said is the truth. The <pl id='Q62944263'>Andrians</pl> too assert that every other year at their feast of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> wine flows of its own accord from the sanctuary. If the Greeks are to be believed in these matters, one might with equal reason accept what the <pl id='Q410453'>Ethiopians</pl> above <pl id='Q29888'>Syene</pl> say about the table of the sun. </p>
<p id='6.26.3'><b>6.26.3</b> On the <pl id='Q106997152'>acropolis</pl> of the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> is a <pl id='Q107042178'>sanctuary</pl> of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>. The <prn id='Q107043394'>image</prn> is of ivory and gold. They say that the goddess is the work of <prn id='Q177302'>Pheidias</prn>. On her helmet is an image of a cock, this bird being very ready to fight. The bird might also be considered as sacred to <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> <prn id='Q1350313'>Ergane</prn> (the worker). </p>
<p id='6.26.4'><b>6.26.4</b> <pl id='Q56650616'>Cyllene</pl> is one hundred and twenty stades distant from <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>; it faces <pl id='Q4951156'>Sicily</pl> and affords ships a suitable anchorage. It is the port of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>, and received its name from a man of <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl>. <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> does not mention <pl id='Q56650616'>Cyllene</pl> in the list of the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>, but in a later part of the poem he has shown that <pl id='Q56650616'>Cyllene</pl> was one of the towns he knew. </p>
<p id='6.26.5'><b>6.26.5</b> “<prn id='Q1205276'>Polydamas</prn> stripped <prn id='Q7110065'>Otus</prn> of <pl id='Q56650616'>Cyllene</pl>, Comrade of <prn id='Q2300199'>Phyleides</prn> (Meges son of Phyleus) and ruler of the great-souled <pl id='Q12872855'>Epeans</pl>.” In <pl id='Q56650616'>Cyllene</pl> is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>, and one of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>. But the image of <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn>, most devoutly worshipped by the inhabitants, is the male member upright on the pedestal. </p>
<p id='6.26.6'><b>6.26.6</b> The land of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> is fruitful, being especially suited to the growth of fine flax. Now while hemp and flax, both the ordinary and the fine variety, are sown by those whose soil is suited to grow it, the threads from which the <pl id='Q210258'>Seres</pl> make the dresses are produced from no bark, but in a different way as follows. There is in the land of the <pl id='Q210258'>Seres</pl> an insect which the Greeks call ser, though the <pl id='Q210258'>Seres</pl> themselves give it another name. </p>
<p id='6.26.7'><b>6.26.7</b> Its size is twice that of the largest beetle, but in other respects it is like the <prn id='Q1357'>spiders</prn> that spin under trees, and furthermore it has, like the <prn id='Q1357'>spider</prn>, eight feet. These creatures are reared by the <pl id='Q210258'>Seres</pl>, who build them houses adapted for winter and for summer. The product of the creatures, a clue of fine thread, is found rolled round their feet. </p>
<p id='6.26.8'><b>6.26.8</b> They keep them for four years, feeding them on millet, but in the fifth year, knowing that they have no longer to live, they give them green reed to eat. This of all foods the creature likes best; so it stuffs itself with the reed till it bursts with surfeit, and after it has thus died they find inside it the greater part of the thread. Seria is known to be an island lying in a recess of the <pl id='Q1363807'>Red Sea</pl>. </p>
<p id='6.26.9'><b>6.26.9</b> But I have heard that it is not the <pl id='Q1363807'>Red Sea</pl>, but a river called Ser, that makes this island, just as in <pl id='Q11768'>Egypt</pl> the Delta is surrounded by the <pl id='Q3392'>Nile</pl> and by no sea. Such another island is Seria said to be. These <pl id='Q210258'>Seres</pl> themselves are of <pl id='Q410453'>Aethiopian</pl> race, as are the inhabitants of the neighboring islands, Abasa and SacaeaYY. Some say, however, that they are not <pl id='Q410453'>Ethiopians</pl> but a mongrel race of <pl id='Q845909'>Scythians</pl> and <pl id='Q17055962'>Indians</pl>. </p>
<p id='6.26.10'><b>6.26.10</b> Such are the accounts that are given. As you go from <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> to <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaia</pl> you come after one hundred and fifty-seven stades to the river <pl id='Q3362574'>Larisus</pl>, and in modern days this river forms the boundary between <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> and <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaia</pl>, though of old the boundary was Cape <pl id='Q15056188'>Araxus</pl> on the coast. </p>
<p id='7.1.1'><b>7.1.1</b> BOOK 7 <br>The land between <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> and <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonia</pl>, reaching down to the eastern sea, is now called <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaia</pl> after the inhabitants, but of old was called <pl id='Q2790451'>Aegialus</pl> and those who lived in it <pl id='Q2790451'>Aegialians</pl>. According to the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl> the name is derived from <prn id='Q1422648'>Aegialeus</prn>, who was king in what is now <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonia</pl>; others say that it is from the land, the greater part of which is coast (aigialos). </p>
<p id='7.1.2'><b>7.1.2</b> Later on, after the death of <prn id='Q336428'>Hellen</prn>, <prn id='Q514746'>Xuthus</prn> was expelled from <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessaly</pl> by the rest of the sons of <prn id='Q336428'>Hellen</prn>, who charged him with having appropriated some of the ancestral property. But he fled to <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, where he was deemed worthy to wed the daughter of <prn id='Q301219'>Erechtheus</prn>, by whom he had sons, <prn id='Q607170'>Achaeus</prn> and <prn id='Q853462'>Ion</prn>. On the death of <prn id='Q301219'>Erechtheus</prn> <prn id='Q514746'>Xuthus</prn> was appointed judge to decide which of his sons should succeed him. He decided that <prn id='Q974346'>Cecrops</prn>, the eldest of them, should be king, and was accordingly banished from the land by the rest of the sons of <prn id='Q301219'>Erechtheus</prn>. </p>
<p id='7.1.3'><b>7.1.3</b> He reached <pl id='Q2790451'>Aegialus</pl>, made his home there, and there died. Of his sons, <prn id='Q607170'>Achaeus</prn> with the assistance of allies from <pl id='Q2790451'>Aegialus</pl> and <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> returned to <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessaly</pl> and recovered the throne of his fathers: <prn id='Q853462'>Ion</prn>, while gathering an army against the <pl id='Q2790451'>Aegialians</pl> and <prn id='Q3565937'>Selinus</prn> their king, received a message from <prn id='Q3565937'>Selinus</prn>, who offered to give him in marriage <prn id='Q20100712'>Helice</prn>, his only child, as well as to adopt him as his son and successor. </p>
<p id='7.1.4'><b>7.1.4</b> It so happened that the proposal found favour with <prn id='Q853462'>Ion</prn>, and on the death of <prn id='Q3565937'>Selinus</prn> he became king of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Aegialians</pl>. He called the city he founded in <pl id='Q2790451'>Aegialus</pl> <pl id='Q1432654'>Helice</pl> after his wife, and called the inhabitants Ionians after himself. This, however, was not a change of name, but an addition to it, for the folk were named <pl id='Q2790451'>Aegialian</pl> Ionians. The original name clung to the land even longer than to the people; for at any rate in the list of the allies of <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn>, <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> is content to mention the ancient name of the land: Throughout all <pl id='Q2790451'>Aegialus</pl> and about wide <pl id='Q1432654'>Helice</pl>.” 2.575 </p>
<p id='7.1.5'><b>7.1.5</b> At that time in the reign of <prn id='Q853462'>Ion</prn> the <pl id='Q11918833'>Eleusinians</pl> made war on the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, and these having invited <prn id='Q853462'>Ion</prn> to be their leader in the war, he met his death in <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl>, his tomb being in the deme of <pl id='Q18015506'>Potamus</pl>. The descendants of <prn id='Q853462'>Ion</prn> became rulers of the <pl id='Q620874'>Ionians</pl>, until they themselves as well as the people were expelled by the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>. The <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> at that time had themselves been expelled from <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl> and <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> by the <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn>. </p>
<p id='7.1.6'><b>7.1.6</b> The history of the <pl id='Q620874'>Ionians</pl> in relation to the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> I will give as soon as I have explained the reason why the inhabitants of <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl> and <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> were the only <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesians</pl> to be called <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> before the return of the <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn>. <prn id='Q3621412'>Archander</prn> and <prn id='Q12874093'>Architeles</prn>, sons of <prn id='Q607170'>Achaeus</prn>, came from <pl id='Q2089144'>Phthiotis</pl> to <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>, and after their arrival became sons-in-law of <prn id='Q210883'>Danaus</prn>, <prn id='Q12874093'>Architeles</prn> marrying <prn id='Q787120'>Automate</prn> and <prn id='Q3621412'>Archander</prn> <prn id='Q15208184'>Scaea</prn>. A very clear proof that they settled in <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> is the fact that <prn id='Q3621412'>Archander</prn> named his son <prn id='Q123333787'>Metanastes</prn> (Settler). </p>
<p id='7.1.7'><b>7.1.7</b> When the sons of <prn id='Q607170'>Achaeus</prn> came to power in <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> and <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl>, the inhabitants of these towns came to be called <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>. The name <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> was common to them; the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> had the special name of <prn id='Q190582'>Danai</prn>. On the occasion referred to, being expelled by the <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn> from <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> and <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl>, the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> themselves and their king <prn id='Q2803572'>Tisamenus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q192407'>Orestes</prn>, sent heralds to the <pl id='Q620874'>Ionians</pl>, offering to settle among them without warfare. But the kings of the <pl id='Q620874'>Ionians</pl> were afraid that, if the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> united with them, <prn id='Q2803572'>Tisamenus</prn> would be chosen king of the combined people because of his manliness and noble lineage. </p>
<p id='7.1.8'><b>7.1.8</b> The <pl id='Q620874'>Ionians</pl> rejected the proposal of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> and came out to fight them; in the battle <prn id='Q2803572'>Tisamenus</prn> was killed, the <pl id='Q620874'>Ionians</pl> were overcome by the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, fled to <pl id='Q1432654'>Helice</pl>, where they were besieged, and afterwards were allowed to depart under a truce. The body of <prn id='Q2803572'>Tisamenus</prn> was buried in <pl id='Q1432654'>Helice</pl> by the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, but afterwards at the command of the <prn id='Q682558'>Delphic oracle</prn> the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> carried his bones to <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>, and in my own day his grave still existed in the place where the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> take the dinner called Pheiditia. </p>
<p id='7.1.9'><b>7.1.9</b> The <pl id='Q620874'>Ionians</pl> went to <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl>, and they were allowed to settle there by the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> and their king <prn id='Q1255043'>Melanthus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q3564602'>Andropompus</prn>, I suppose for the sake of <prn id='Q853462'>Ion</prn> and his achievements when he was commander-in-chief of the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>. Another account is that the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> suspected that the <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn> would not keep their hands off them, and received the <pl id='Q620874'>Ionians</pl> to strengthen themselves rather than for any good-will they felt towards the <pl id='Q620874'>Ionians</pl>. </p>
<p id='7.2.1'><b>7.2.1</b> A few years afterwards <prn id='Q1463103'>Medon</prn> and <prn id='Q16516576'>Neileus</prn>, the oldest of the sons of <prn id='Q1052888'>Codrus</prn>, quarrelled about the rule, and <prn id='Q16516576'>Neileus</prn> refused to allow <prn id='Q1463103'>Medon</prn> to rule over him, because he was lame in one foot. The disputants agreed to refer the matter to the <prn id='Q682558'>Delphic oracle</prn>, and the <prn id='Q220344'>Pythian priestess</prn> gave the kingdom of <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> to <prn id='Q1463103'>Medon</prn>. So <prn id='Q16516576'>Neileus</prn> and the rest of the sons of <prn id='Q1052888'>Codrus</prn> set out to found a colony, taking with them any <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> who wished to go with them, but the greatest number of their company was composed of <pl id='Q620874'>Ionians</pl>. </p>
<p id='7.2.2'><b>7.2.2</b> This was the third expedition sent out from Greece under kings of a race different from that of the common folk. The earliest was when <prn id='Q504076'>Iolaus</prn> of <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>, the nephew of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, led the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> and <pl id='Q1141295'>Thespians</pl> to <pl id='Q3760293'>Sardinia</pl>. One generation before the <pl id='Q620874'>Ionians</pl> set sail from <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> and <prn id='Q1065225'>Minyans</prn> who had been expelled from <pl id='Q192483'>Lemnos</pl> by the <pl id='Q14472556'>Pelasgians</pl> were led by the <pl id='Q11225429'>Theban</pl> <prn id='Q603759'>Theras</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q784528'>Autesion</prn>, to the island now called after him, but formerly named <pl id='Q433004'>Calliste</pl>. </p>
<p id='7.2.3'><b>7.2.3</b> The third occasion was the expedition to which I have referred, when the sons of <prn id='Q1052888'>Codrus</prn> were appointed leaders of the <pl id='Q620874'>Ionians</pl>, although they were not of <prn id='Q853462'>Ion</prn>'s lineage, but were, through <prn id='Q1052888'>Codrus</prn> and <prn id='Q1255043'>Melanthus</prn>, <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> of <pl id='Q2047396'>Pylus</pl>, and, on their mother's side, <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>. Those who shared in the expedition of the <pl id='Q620874'>Ionians</pl> were the following among the Greeks: some <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> under <prn id='Q7186285'>Philotas</prn>, a descendant of <prn id='Q254381'>Peneleus</prn>; <prn id='Q1065225'>Minyans</prn> of <pl id='Q543895'>Orchomenus</pl>, because they were related to the sons of <prn id='Q1052888'>Codrus</prn>. </p>
<p id='7.2.4'><b>7.2.4</b> There also took part all the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> except the <pl id='Q75459'>Delphians</pl>, and with them <pl id='Q305516'>Abantes</pl> from <pl id='Q173096'>Euboea</pl>. Ships for the voyage were given to the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> by PhilogeneYY and <prn id='Q66125114'>Damon</prn>, <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> and sons of Euctemon1, who themselves led the colony. When they landed in <prn id='Q48'>Asia</prn> they divided, the different parties attacking the different cities on the coast, and <prn id='Q16516576'>Neileus</prn> with his party made for <pl id='Q169460'>Miletus</pl>. </p>
<p id='7.2.5'><b>7.2.5</b> The <pl id='Q169460'>Milesians</pl> themselves give the following account of their earliest history. For two generations, they say, their land was called Anactoria, during the reigns of AnaxYY, an aboriginal, and of <prn id='Q10420712'>Asterius</prn> his son; but when <prn id='Q2470261'>Miletus</prn> landed with an army of <pl id='Q4752820'>Cretans</pl> both the land and the city changed their name to <pl id='Q169460'>Miletus</pl>. <prn id='Q2470261'>Miletus</prn> and his men came from <pl id='Q4752820'>Crete</pl>, fleeing from <prn id='Q23168'>Minos</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q165170'>Europa</prn>; the <pl id='Q193214'>Carians</pl>, the former inhabitants of the land, united with the <pl id='Q4752820'>Cretans</pl>. But to resume. </p>
<p id='7.2.6'><b>7.2.6</b> When the <pl id='Q620874'>Ionians</pl> had overcome the ancient <pl id='Q169460'>Milesians</pl> they killed every male, except those who escaped at the capture of the city, but the wives of the <pl id='Q169460'>Milesians</pl> and their daughters they married.

The sanctuary of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> at <pl id='Q671358'>Didymi</pl>, and his oracle, are earlier than the immigration of the <pl id='Q620874'>Ionians</pl>, while the cult of <pl id='Q43018'>Ephesian</pl> <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> is far more ancient still than their coming. </p>
<p id='7.2.7'><b>7.2.7</b> <prn id='Q134929'>Pindar</prn>, however, it seems to me, did not learn everything about the goddess, for he says that this sanctuary was founded by the <prn id='Q134154'>Amazons</prn> during their campaign against <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> and <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>. It is a fact that the women from the <pl id='Q684421'>Thermodon</pl>, as they knew the <pl id='Q43018'>sanctuary</pl> from of old, sacrificed to the <pl id='Q43018'>Ephesian</pl> goddess both on this occasion and when they had fled from <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>; some of them earlier still, when they had fled from <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>, having come to the sanctuary as suppliants. However, it was not by the <prn id='Q134154'>Amazons</prn> that the sanctuary was founded, but by <prn id='Q21548796'>Coresus</prn>, an aboriginal, and Ephesus, who is thought to have been a son of the river <pl id='Q922382'>Cayster</pl>, and from <pl id='Q47611'>Ephesus</pl> the city received its name. </p>
<p id='7.2.8'><b>7.2.8</b> The inhabitants of the land were partly <pl id='Q375221'>Leleges</pl>, a branch of the <pl id='Q193214'>Carians</pl>, but the greater number were <pl id='Q620765'>Lydians</pl>. In addition there were others who dwelt around the sanctuary for the sake of its protection, and these included some women of the race of the <prn id='Q134154'>Amazons</prn>. But <prn id='Q512545'>Androclus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q1052888'>Codrus</prn> (for he it was who was appointed king of the <pl id='Q620874'>Ionians</pl> who sailed against <pl id='Q47611'>Ephesus</pl>) expelled from the land the <pl id='Q375221'>Leleges</pl> and <pl id='Q620765'>Lydians</pl> who occupied the upper city. Those, however, who dwelt around the sanctuary had nothing to fear; they exchanged oaths of friendship with the <pl id='Q620874'>Ionians</pl> and escaped warfare. <prn id='Q512545'>Androclus</prn> also took <pl id='Q13580795'>Samos</pl> from the <pl id='Q13580795'>Samians</pl>, and for a time the <pl id='Q47611'>Ephesians</pl> held <pl id='Q13580795'>Samos</pl> and the adjacent islands. </p>

<p id='7.3.8'><b>7.3.8</b> The cities of <pl id='Q536598'>Clazomenae</pl> and <pl id='Q428732'>Phocaea</pl> were not inhabited before the <pl id='Q620874'>Ionians</pl> came to <prn id='Q48'>Asia</prn>.

This <prn id='Q18276393'>Procles</prn> was descended from <prn id='Q853462'>Ion</prn>, son of <prn id='Q514746'>Xuthus</prn>.

<p id='7.4.3'><b>7.4.3</b> The <pl id='Q13580795'>Samians</pl> fled and some of them made their home in an island near <pl id='Q41741'>Thrace</pl>, and as a result of their settling there the name of the island was changed from Dardania to <pl id='Q38283593'>Samothrace</pl>.

<p id='7.4.4'><b>7.4.4</b> Some say that the <pl id='Q841207'>sanctuary</pl> of <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> in <pl id='Q13580795'>Samos</pl> was established by those who sailed in the <prn id='Q317932'>Argo</prn>, and that these brought the image from <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>. But the <pl id='Q13580795'>Samians</pl> themselves hold that the goddess was born in the island by the side of the river <pl id='Q25123205'>Imbrasus</pl> under the withy that even in my time grew in the <pl id='Q841207'>Heraeum</pl>. That this sanctuary is very old might be inferred especially by considering the image; for it is the work of an <pl id='Q191082'>Aeginetan</pl>, <prn id='Q3963012'>Smilis</prn>, the son of EuclidesYY. This <prn id='Q3963012'>Smilis</prn> was a contemporary of <prn id='Q134756'>Daedalus</prn>, though of less repute. </p>
<p id='7.4.5'><b>7.4.5</b> <prn id='Q134756'>Daedalus</prn> belonged to the royal <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> clan called the <prn id='Q33195778'>Metionidae</prn>, and he was rather famous among all men not only for his art but also for his wandering and his misfortunes. For he killed his sister's son, and knowing the customs of his city he went into exile of his own accord to <prn id='Q23168'>Minos</prn> in <pl id='Q4752820'>Crete</pl>. There he made images for <prn id='Q23168'>Minos</prn> and for the daughters of <prn id='Q23168'>Minos</prn>, as <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> sets forth in the <prn id='Q8275'>Iliad</prn> 5 </p>
<p id='7.4.6'><b>7.4.6</b> but being condemned by <prn id='Q23168'>Minos</prn> on some charge he was thrown into prison along with his son.

Thereby he became the cause of war between <pl id='Q4951156'>Sicilians</pl> and <pl id='Q4752820'>Cretans</pl>, because when <prn id='Q23168'>Minos</prn> demanded him back, <prn id='Q1559958'>Cocalus</prn> refused to give him up. He was so much admired by the daughters of <prn id='Q1559958'>Cocalus</prn> for his artistic skill that to please him these women actually plotted against <prn id='Q23168'>Minos</prn> to put him to death. </p>
<p id='7.4.7'><b>7.4.7</b> It is plain that the renown of <prn id='Q134756'>Daedalus</prn> spread over all <pl id='Q4951156'>Sicily</pl> and even over the greater part of <pl id='Q913582'>Italy</pl>.

<p id='7.4.8'><b>7.4.8</b> . . . <prn id='Q162163'>Ion</prn> the tragic poet says in his history that <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> came to the island when it was uninhabited; that there he had intercourse with a nymph, and that when she was in her pains there was a fall of snow (chion), and that accordingly <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> called his son <prn id='Q1074481'>Chios</prn>. <prn id='Q162163'>Ion</prn> also says that <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> had intercourse with another nymph, by whom he had <prn id='Q392412'>Agelus</prn> and <prn id='Q18816354'>Melas</prn>; that in course of time <prn id='Q937216'>Oenopion</prn> too sailed with a fleet from <pl id='Q4752820'>Crete</pl> to <pl id='Q748832'>Chios</pl>, accompanied by his sons <prn id='Q107392615'>Talus</prn>, <prn id='Q12877329'>Euanthes</prn>, <prn id='Q18816354'>Melas</prn>, <prn id='Q106322045'>Salagus</prn> and <prn id='Q754714'>Athamas</prn>. </p>
<p id='7.4.9'><b>7.4.9</b> <pl id='Q193214'>Carians</pl> too came to the island, in the reign of <prn id='Q937216'>Oenopion</prn>, and <pl id='Q305516'>Abantes</pl> from <pl id='Q173096'>Euboea</pl>. <prn id='Q937216'>Oenopion</prn> and his sons were succeeded by <prn id='Q117705470'>Amphiclus</prn>, who because of an oracle from <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> came from <pl id='Q107586662'>Histiaea</pl> in <pl id='Q173096'>Euboea</pl>. Three generations from <prn id='Q117705470'>Amphiclus</prn>, <prn id='Q12872397'>Hector</prn>, who also had made himself king, made war on those <pl id='Q305516'>Abantes</pl> and <pl id='Q193214'>Carians</pl> who lived in the island, slew some in battle, and forced others to surrender and depart. </p>
<p id='7.4.10'><b>7.4.10</b> When the <pl id='Q748832'>Chians</pl> were rid of war, it occurred to <prn id='Q12872397'>Hector</prn> that they ought to unite with the <pl id='Q620874'>Ionians</pl> in sacrificing at <pl id='Q1310950'>Panionium</pl>. It is said that the <pl id='Q620874'>Ionian</pl> confederacy gave him a tripod as a prize for valor. Such was the account of the <pl id='Q748832'>Chians</pl> that I found given by <prn id='Q162163'>Ion</prn>. However, he gives no reason why the <pl id='Q748832'>Chians</pl> are classed with the <pl id='Q620874'>Ionians</pl>. </p>
<p id='7.5.1'><b>7.5.1</b> <pl id='Q1379299'>Smyrna</pl>, one of the twelve <pl id='Q255325'>Aeolian</pl> cities, built on that site which even now they call the old city, was seized by <pl id='Q620874'>Ionians</pl> who set out from <pl id='Q1142488'>Colophon</pl> and displaced the <pl id='Q255325'>Aeolians</pl>; subsequently, however, the <pl id='Q620874'>Ionians</pl> allowed the <pl id='Q1379299'>Smyrnaeans</pl> to take their place in the general assembly at <pl id='Q1310950'>Panionium</pl>. The modern city was founded by <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn>, in accordance with a vision in a dream. </p>
<p id='7.5.2'><b>7.5.2</b> It is said that <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn> was hunting on Mount Pagus, and that after the hunt was over he came to a sanctuary of the Nemeses, and found there a spring and a plane-tree in front of the sanctuary, growing over the water. While he slept under the plane-tree it is said that the Nemeses appeared and bade him found a city there and to remove into it the <pl id='Q1379299'>Smyrnaeans</pl> from the old city. </p>
<p id='7.5.3'><b>7.5.3</b> So the <pl id='Q1379299'>Smyrnaeans</pl> sent ambassadors to <pl id='Q1933754'>Clarus</pl> to make inquiries about the circumstance, and the god made answer: “Thrice, yes, four times blest will those men be Who shall dwell in Pagus beyond the sacred <pl id='Q7337631'>Meles</pl>.” So they migrated of their own free will, and believe now in two Nemeses instead of one, saying that their mother is <prn id='Q131203'>Night</prn>, while the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> say that the father of the goddess in <pl id='Q1768553'>Rhamnus</pl> is <prn id='Q161419'>Ocean</prn>. </p>
<p id='7.5.4'><b>7.5.4</b> The land of the <pl id='Q620874'>Ionians</pl> has the finest possible climate, and sanctuaries such as are to be found nowhere else. First because of its size and wealth is that of the <pl id='Q43018'>Ephesian</pl> goddess, and then come two unfinished sanctuaries of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, the one in <pl id='Q671358'>Branchidae</pl>, in <pl id='Q169460'>Milesian</pl> territory, and the one at <pl id='Q1933754'>Clarus</pl> in the land of the <pl id='Q1142488'>Colophonians</pl>. Besides these, two temples in <pl id='Q620874'>Ionia</pl> were burnt down by the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl>, the one of <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> in <pl id='Q13580795'>Samos</pl> and that of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> at <pl id='Q428732'>Phocaea</pl>. Damaged though they are by fire, I found them a wonder. </p>
<p id='7.5.5'><b>7.5.5</b> You would be delighted too with the sanctuary of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> at <pl id='Q723091'>Erythrae</pl> and with the temple of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> at <pl id='Q142819'>Priene</pl>, the latter because of its image and the former on account of its age. The image is like neither the <pl id='Q191082'>Aeginetan</pl>, as they are called, nor yet the most ancient <pl id='Q122443'>Attic</pl> images; it is absolutely <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptian</pl>, if ever there was such. There was a wooden raft, on which the god set out from <pl id='Q58455019'>Tyre</pl> in <pl id='Q41642'>Phoenicia</pl>. The reason for this we are not told even by the <pl id='Q723091'>Erythraeans</pl> themselves. </p>
<p id='7.5.6'><b>7.5.6</b> They say that when the raft reached the <pl id='Q37495'>Ionian Sea</pl> it came to rest at the cape called Mesate (Middle) which is on the mainland, just midway between the harbor of the <pl id='Q723091'>Erythraeans</pl> and the island of <pl id='Q748832'>Chios</pl>. When the raft rested off the cape the <pl id='Q723091'>Erythraeans</pl> made great efforts, and the <pl id='Q748832'>Chians</pl> no less, both being keen to land the image on their own shores. </p>
<p id='7.5.7'><b>7.5.7</b> At last a man of <pl id='Q723091'>Erythrae</pl> (his name was <prn id='Q2338787'>Phormio</prn>) who gained a living by the sea and by catching fish, but had lost his sight through disease, saw a vision in a dream to the effect that the women of <pl id='Q723091'>Erythrae</pl> must cut off their locks, and in this way the men would, with a rope woven from the hair, tow the raft to their shores. The women of the citizens absolutely refused to obey the dream; </p>
<p id='7.5.8'><b>7.5.8</b> but the Thracian women, both the slaves and the free who lived there, offered themselves to be shorn. And so the men of <pl id='Q723091'>Erythrae</pl> towed the raft ashore. Accordingly no women except Thracian women are allowed within the sanctuary of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, and the hair rope is still kept by the natives. The same people say that the fisherman recovered his sight and retained it for the rest of his life. </p>
<p id='7.5.9'><b>7.5.9</b> There is also in <pl id='Q723091'>Erythrae</pl> a temple of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> <prn id='Q107090895'>Polias</prn> and a huge wooden image of her sitting on a throne; she holds a distaff in either hand and wears a firmament on her head. That this image is the work of <prn id='Q2327459'>Endoeus</prn> we inferred, among other signs, from the workmanship, and especially from the white marble images of <prn id='Q184353'>Graces</prn> and <prn id='Q201411'>Seasons</prn> that stand in the open before the entrance. A sanctuary too of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> was made by the Smyrnaeans in my time between Mount Coryphe and a sea into which no other water flows. </p>
<p id='7.5.10'><b>7.5.10</b> <pl id='Q620874'>Ionia</pl> has other things to record besides its sanctuaries and its climate. There is, for instance, in the land of the <pl id='Q47611'>Ephesians</pl> the river Cenchrius, the strange mountain of Pion and the spring Halitaea. The land of <pl id='Q169460'>Miletus</pl> has the spring <prn id='Q855426'>Biblis</prn>, of whose love the poets have sung. In the land of <pl id='Q1142488'>Colophon</pl> is the grove of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, of ash-trees, and not far from the grove is the river Ales, the coldest river in <pl id='Q620874'>Ionia</pl>. </p>
<p id='7.5.11'><b>7.5.11</b> In the land of <pl id='Q302905'>Lebedus</pl> are baths, which are both wonderful and useful. <pl id='Q17586'>Teos</pl>, too, has baths at Cape MacriaYY, some in the clefts of the rock, filled by the tide, others made to display wealth. The <pl id='Q536598'>Clazomenians</pl> have baths (incidentally they worship <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn>) and a cave called the cave of the mother of PyrrhusYY; they tell a legend about PyrrhusYY the shepherd. </p>
<p id='7.5.12'><b>7.5.12</b> The <pl id='Q723091'>Erythraeans</pl> have a district called Chalcis, from which their third tribe takes its name, and in Chalcis is a cape stretching into the sea, and on it are sea baths, the most useful baths in <pl id='Q620874'>Ionia</pl>. The <pl id='Q1379299'>Smyrnaeans</pl> have the river <pl id='Q7337631'>Meles</pl>, with its lovely water, and at its springs is the grotto, where they say that <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> composed his poems. </p>
<p id='7.5.13'><b>7.5.13</b> One of the sights of <pl id='Q748832'>Chios</pl> is the grave of <prn id='Q937216'>Oenopion</prn>, about whose exploits they tell certain legends. The <pl id='Q13580795'>Samians</pl> have on the road to the <pl id='Q841207'>Heraeum</pl> the tomb of <prn id='Q7320035'>Rhadine</prn> and Leontichus1, and those who are crossed in love are wont to go to the tomb and pray. <pl id='Q620874'>Ionia</pl>, in fact, is a land of wonders that are but little inferior to those of Greece. </p>
<p id='7.6.1'><b>7.6.1</b> When the <pl id='Q620874'>Ionians</pl> were gone the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> divided their land among themselves and settled in their cities. These were twelve in number, at least such as were known to all the Greek world; <pl id='Q1231662'>Dyme</pl>, the nearest to <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>, after it <pl id='Q11939304'>Olenus</pl>, <pl id='Q3562963'>Pharae</pl>, <pl id='Q56760760'>Triteia</pl>, <pl id='Q2148349'>Rhypes</pl>, <pl id='Q60790078'>Aegium</pl>, <pl id='Q12879058'>Ceryneia</pl>, <pl id='Q3555318'>Bura</pl>, <pl id='Q1432654'>Helice</pl> also and <pl id='Q16737279'>Aegae</pl>, <pl id='Q18363976'>Aegeira</pl> and <pl id='Q2068130'>Pellene</pl>, the last city on the side of <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonia</pl>. In them, which had previously been inhabited by <pl id='Q620874'>Ionians</pl>, settled the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> and their princes. </p>
<p id='7.6.2'><b>7.6.2</b> Those who held the greatest power among the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> were the sons of <prn id='Q2803572'>Tisamenus</prn>, <prn id='Q107389778'>Daimenes</prn>, <prn id='Q15206133'>Sparton</prn>, <prn id='Q15206082'>Tellis</prn> and <prn id='Q15206125'>Leontomenes</prn>; his eldest son, <prn id='Q42709229'>Cometes</prn>, had already crossed with a fleet to <prn id='Q48'>Asia</prn>. These then at the time held sway among the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> along with <prn id='Q1158255'>Damasias</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q1336476'>Penthilus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q192407'>Orestes</prn>, who on his father's side was cousin to the sons of <prn id='Q2803572'>Tisamenus</prn>. Equally powerful with the chiefs already mentioned were two <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> from <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl>, <prn id='Q3563956'>Preugenes</prn> and his son, whose name was <prn id='Q12883286'>Patreus</prn>. The <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> allowed them to found a city in their territory, and to it was given the name <pl id='Q133123'>Patrae</pl> from <prn id='Q12883286'>Patreus</prn>. </p>
<p id='7.6.3'><b>7.6.3</b> The wars of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> were as follow. In the expedition of <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn> to <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl> they furnished, while still dwelling in <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl> and <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>, the largest contingent in the Greek army. When the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl> under <prn id='Q129165'>Xerxes</prn> attacked Greece the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> it is clear had no part in the advance of <prn id='Q44228'>Leonidas</prn> to <pl id='Q194450'>Thermopylae</pl>, nor in the naval actions fought by the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> with <prn id='Q179552'>Themistocles</prn> off <pl id='Q173096'>Euboea</pl> and at <pl id='Q178850'>Salamis</pl>, and they are not included in the <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconian</pl> or in the <pl id='Q122443'>Attic</pl> list of allies. </p>
<p id='7.6.4'><b>7.6.4</b> They were absent from the action at <pl id='Q204636'>Plataea</pl>, for otherwise the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> would surely have had their name inscribed on the offering of the Greeks at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>. My view is that they stayed at home to guard their several fatherlands, while because of the <prn id='Q42937'>Trojan War</prn> they scorned to be led by <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn> of <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl>. This became plain in course of time. For when later on the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> began the war with the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> were eager for the alliance with <pl id='Q133123'>Patrae</pl>, and were no less well disposed towards <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>. </p>
<p id='7.6.5'><b>7.6.5</b> Of the wars waged afterwards by the confederate Greeks, the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> took part in the battle of <pl id='Q13574678'>Chaeroneia</pl> against the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> under <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn>, but they say that they did not march out into <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessaly</pl> to what is called the <pl id='Q192980'>Lamian</pl> war, for they had not yet recovered from the reverse in <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl>. The local guide at <pl id='Q133123'>Patrae</pl> used to say that the wrestler <prn id='Q34601'>Chilon</prn> was the only <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaean</pl> who took part in the action at <pl id='Q192980'>Lamia</pl>. </p>
<p id='7.6.6'><b>7.6.6</b> I myself know that <prn id='Q107092424'>Adrastus</prn>, a <pl id='Q620765'>Lydian</pl>, helped the Greeks as a private individual, although the <pl id='Q620765'>Lydian</pl> commonwealth held aloof. A likeness of this <prn id='Q107092424'>Adrastus</prn> in bronze was dedicated in front of the sanctuary of <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl> <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> by the <pl id='Q620765'>Lydians</pl>, who wrote an inscription to the effect that <prn id='Q107092424'>Adrastus</prn> died fighting for the Greeks against <prn id='Q347164'>Leonnatus</prn>. </p>
<p id='7.6.7'><b>7.6.7</b> The march to <pl id='Q194450'>Thermopylae</pl> against the army of the Gauls was left alone by all the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesians</pl> alike; for, as the barbarians had no ships, the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesians</pl> anticipated no danger from the Gauls, if only they walled off the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthian</pl> <pl id='Q215200'>Isthmus</pl> from the sea at <pl id='Q1811299'>Lechaeum</pl> to the other sea at <pl id='Q111565756'>Cenchreae</pl>. </p>
<p id='7.6.8'><b>7.6.8</b> This was the policy of all the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesians</pl> at this time. But when the Gauls had somehow crossed in ships to <prn id='Q48'>Asia</prn>, the condition of the Greeks was as follows. No Greek state was preeminent in strength. For the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> were still prevented from recovering their former prosperity by the reverse at <pl id='Q2606004'>Leuctra</pl> combined with the union of the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> at <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl> and the settlement of <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> on their border. </p>
<p id='7.6.9'><b>7.6.9</b> <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> had been brought so low by <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn> that when, a few years later, <prn id='Q207183'>Cassander</prn> brought back her people, they were too weak even to hold their own. The <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> had indeed the goodwill of Greece, especially for their later exploits, but they never found it possible to recover from the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonian</pl> war. </p>
<p id='7.7.1'><b>7.7.1</b> When the Greeks no longer took concerted action, but each state acted for itself alone, the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> enjoyed their greatest power. For except <pl id='Q2068130'>Pellene</pl> no <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaean</pl> city had at any time suffered from tyranny, while the disasters of war and of pestilence touched <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaia</pl> less than any other part of Greece. So we have what was called the <prn id='Q244796'>Achaean League</prn>, and the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> had a concerted policy and carried out concerted actions. </p>
<p id='7.7.2'><b>7.7.2</b> As a place of assembly they resolved to have <pl id='Q60790078'>Aegium</pl>, for, after <pl id='Q1432654'>Helice</pl> had been swallowed up by the sea, <pl id='Q60790078'>Aegium</pl> from of old surpassed in reputation the other cities of <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaia</pl>, while at the time it enjoyed great power. Of the remaining Greeks the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl> were the first to join the <prn id='Q244796'>Achaean League</prn>, and after the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl> there entered it yet other <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesians</pl>, some forthwith and others after an interval. Some too who lived outside the <pl id='Q215200'>Isthmus</pl> were persuaded to join the <prn id='Q244796'>Achaean League</prn> by its unbroken growth in power. </p>
<p id='7.7.3'><b>7.7.3</b> Alone among the Greeks the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> were the bitter enemies of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> and openly carried on war against them. <pl id='Q2068130'>Pellene</pl>, a city of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, was captured by <prn id='Q299479'>Agis</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q889042'>Eudamidas</prn>, who was king at <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>; but he was immediately driven out by the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl> under <prn id='Q317331'>Aratus</prn>. <prn id='Q310811'>Cleomenes</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q173795'>Leonidas</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q930518'>Cleonymus</prn>, king of the other royal house, won a decisive victory at <pl id='Q1231662'>Dyme</pl> over the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl> under <prn id='Q317331'>Aratus</prn>, who attacked him, and afterwards concluded a peace with the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> and <prn id='Q108816'>Antigonus</prn>. </p>
<p id='7.7.4'><b>7.7.4</b> This <prn id='Q108816'>Antigonus</prn> at the time ruled over the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl>, being the guardian of <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q313847'>Demetrius</prn>, who was still a boy. He was also a cousin of <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn>, whose mother he had taken to wife. With this <prn id='Q108816'>Antigonus</prn> then and the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> <prn id='Q310811'>Cleomenes</prn> made peace, and immediately broke all the oaths he had sworn by reducing to slavery <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl>, the city of the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl>. Because of <prn id='Q310811'>Cleomenes</prn> and his treachery the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> suffered the reverse at <pl id='Q59431661'>Sellasia</pl>, where they were defeated by the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> under <prn id='Q108816'>Antigonus</prn>. In my account of <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl> I shall again have occasion to mention <prn id='Q310811'>Cleomenes</prn>. </p>
<p id='7.7.5'><b>7.7.5</b> When <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q313847'>Demetrius</prn>, reached man's estate, and <prn id='Q108816'>Antigonus</prn> without reluctance handed over the sovereignty of the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl>, he struck fear into the hearts of all the Greeks. He copied <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q313907'>Amyntas</prn>, who was not his ancestor but really his master, especially by flattering those who were willing to betray their country for their private advantage. At banquets he would give the right hand of friendship offering cups filled not with wine but with deadly poison, a thing which I believe never entered the head of <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn> the son of <prn id='Q313907'>Amyntas</prn>, but poisoning sat very lightly on the conscience of <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn> the son of <prn id='Q313847'>Demetrius</prn>. </p>
<p id='7.7.6'><b>7.7.6</b> He also occupied with garrisons three towns to be used as bases against Greece, and in his insolent contempt for the Greek people he called these cities the keys of Greece. To watch <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl> <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl> was fortified with its acropolis; to watch <pl id='Q173096'>Euboea</pl>, the <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotians</pl> and the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl>, <pl id='Q21235810'>Chalcis</pl> on the <pl id='Q1137741'>Euripus</pl>; against the <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessalians</pl> themselves and the <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolian</pl> people <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn> occupied <pl id='Q60790367'>Magnesia</pl> at the foot of Mount <pl id='Q1334825'>Pelium</pl>. The <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> especially and the <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolians</pl> he harried with continual attacks and raids of bandits. </p>
<p id='7.7.7'><b>7.7.7</b> Already, in my account of <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl> I have described the alliances of Greeks and barbarians with the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> against <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn>, and how the weakness of their allies urged the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> to seek help from <pl id='Q18287233'>Rome</pl>. A short time before, the Romans had sent a force ostensibly to help the <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolians</pl> against <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn>, but really more to spy on the condition of <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl>. </p>
<p id='7.7.8'><b>7.7.8</b> At the appeal of <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> the Romans despatched an army under <prn id='Q91121881'>Otilius</prn>, to give him the name by which he was best known. For the Romans differ from the Greeks in their being called, not by the names of their fathers, but by three names at least, if not more, given to each man. <prn id='Q91121881'>Otilius</prn> had received orders from the Romans to protect <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> and <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolians</pl> from war with <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn>. </p>
<p id='7.7.9'><b>7.7.9</b> <prn id='Q91121881'>Otilius</prn> carried out his orders up to a point, but displeased the Romans in certain of his acts. <pl id='Q107586662'>Hestiaea</pl> in <pl id='Q173096'>Euboea</pl> and <pl id='Q4774674'>Anticyra</pl> in <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl>, which had been compelled to submit to <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn>, he utterly destroyed. It was, I think, for this reason that the senate, when they heard the news, sent <prn id='Q349222'>Flamininus</prn> to succeed <prn id='Q91121881'>Otilius</prn> in his command. </p>
<p id='7.8.1'><b>7.8.1</b> On his arrival <prn id='Q349222'>Flamininus</prn> sacked <pl id='Q16562724'>Eretria</pl>, defeating the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> who were defending it. He then marched against <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl>, which was held by <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn> with a garrison, and sat down to besiege it, while at the same time he sent to the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> and bade them come to <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl> with an army, if they desired to be called allies of <pl id='Q18287233'>Rome</pl> and at the same time to show their goodwill to Greece. </p>
<p id='7.8.2'><b>7.8.2</b> But the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> greatly blamed <prn id='Q349222'>Flamininus</prn> himself, and <prn id='Q91121881'>Otilius</prn> before him, for their savage treatment of ancient Greek cities which had done the Romans no harm, and were subject to the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> against their will. They foresaw too that the Romans were coming to impose their domination both on <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> and on the rest of Greece, merely in fact to take the place of <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn> and the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl>. At the meeting of the League many opposite views were put forward, but at last the Roman party prevailed, and the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> joined <prn id='Q349222'>Flamininus</prn> in besieging <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl>. </p>
<p id='7.8.3'><b>7.8.3</b> On being delivered from the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthians</pl> at once joined the <prn id='Q244796'>Achaean League</prn>; they had joined it on a previous occasion, when the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl> under <prn id='Q317331'>Aratus</prn> drove all the garrison out of <pl id='Q420810'>Acrocorinth</pl>, killing <prn id='Q662932'>Persaeus</prn>, who had been placed in command of the garrison by <prn id='Q108816'>Antigonus</prn>. Hereafter the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> were called allies of the Romans, and in all respects right zealous allies they proved themselves to be. They followed the Romans to <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl> against <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn>; they took part in the campaign against the <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolians</pl>; thirdly they fought side by side with the Romans against the Syrians under <prn id='Q3365'>Antiochus</prn>. </p>
<p id='7.8.4'><b>7.8.4</b> All that the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> did against the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> or the host of the Syrians they did because of their friendship to the Romans; but against the <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolians</pl> they had a long standing private quarrel to settle. When the tyranny of <prn id='Q312689'>Nabis</prn> in <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> was put down, a tyranny marked by extreme ferocity, the affairs of <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl> at once caught the attention of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>. </p>
<p id='7.8.5'><b>7.8.5</b> At this time the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> brought the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> into the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaean</pl> confederacy, exacted from them the strictest justice, and razed the walls of <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> to the ground. These had been built at haphazard at the time of the invasion of <prn id='Q59734'>Demetrius</prn>, and afterwards of the <pl id='Q565751'>Epeirots</pl> under <prn id='Q172353'>Pyrrhus</prn>, but under the tyranny of <prn id='Q312689'>Nabis</prn> they had been strengthened to the greatest possible degree of safety. So the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> destroyed the walls of <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>, and also repealed the laws of <prn id='Q211326'>Lycurgus</prn> that dealt with the training of the youths, at the same time ordering the youths to be trained after the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaean</pl> method. </p>
<p id='7.8.6'><b>7.8.6</b> I shall treat of this more fully in my account of <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl>. The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, deeply offended by the ordinances of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, fled to <prn id='Q355768'>Metellus</prn> and the other commissioners who had come from <pl id='Q18287233'>Rome</pl>. They had come, not at all to bring war upon <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn> and the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl>, as peace had already been made between <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn> and the Romans, but to judge the charges brought against <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn> by the <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessalians</pl> and certain <pl id='Q565751'>Epeirots</pl>. </p>
<p id='7.8.7'><b>7.8.7</b> In actual fact <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn> himself and the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonian</pl> ascendancy had been put down by the Romans; <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn> fighting against the Romans under <prn id='Q349222'>Flamininus</prn> was worsted at the place called <place id='394224LCyn'>Dog's Heads</place>, where in spite of his desperate efforts <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn> was so severely defeated in the encounter that he lost the greater part of his army and agreed with the Romans to evacuate all the cities in Greece that he had captured and forced to submit. </p>
<p id='7.8.8'><b>7.8.8</b> By prayers of all sorts, however, and by vast expenditure he secured from the Romans a nominal peace. The history of <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl>, the power she won under <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn> the son of <prn id='Q313907'>Amyntas</prn>, and her fall under the later <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn>, were foretold by the inspired <prn id='Q12737222'>Sibyl</prn>. This was her oracle: </p>
<p id='7.8.9'><b>7.8.9</b> Ye <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl>, boasting of your <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl> kings, To you the reign of a <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn> will be both good and evil. The first will make you kings over cities and peoples; The younger will lose all the honor, Defeated by men from west and east.” Now those who destroyed the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonian</pl> empire were the Romans, dwelling in the west of Europe, and among the allies fighting on their side was <prn id='Q110745'>Attalus</prn> . . . who also commanded the army from <pl id='Q622319'>Mysia</pl>, a land lying under the rising sun. </p>
<p id='7.9.1'><b>7.9.1</b> On the occasion to which I referred <prn id='Q355768'>Metellus</prn> and the other commissioners resolved not to overlook the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> and the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, and asked the officers of the League to summon the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> to a meeting, so that they might receive all together instructions to be gentler in their treatment of <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl>. The officers replied that they would call a meeting of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> neither for them nor for anyone else who had not a decree of the Roman senate approving the proposal for which the assembly was to be held. <prn id='Q355768'>Metellus</prn> and his colleagues, thinking that the conduct of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> was very insolent, on their arrival at <pl id='Q18287233'>Rome</pl> made before the senate many accusations against the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, not all of which were true. </p>
<p id='7.9.2'><b>7.9.2</b> More accusations still against the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> were made by AreusYY and Alcibiadas, <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> of great distinction at <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> but ungrateful to the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>. For the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> gave them a welcome when exiled by <prn id='Q312689'>Nabis</prn>, and on the tyrant's death restored them to <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> against the will of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> people. On this occasion, therefore, they too arose and attacked the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> with great vehemence before the senate; accordingly, the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, at a meeting of their League, passed sentence of death upon them. </p>
<p id='7.9.3'><b>7.9.3</b> The Roman senate sent <prn id='Q441474'>Appius</prn> and other commissioners to arbitrate between the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> and the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>. The mere sight of <prn id='Q441474'>Appius</prn> and his colleagues was sure to be displeasing to the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, for they brought with them AreusYY and Alcibiadas, detested by the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> at that time beyond all other men. The commissioners vexed the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> yet more when they came to the assembly and delivered speeches more angry than conciliatory. </p>
<p id='7.9.4'><b>7.9.4</b> But <prn id='Q2065138'>Lycortas</prn> of <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl>, than whom no man was more highly esteemed among the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl>, and whose friendship with <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn> had given him something of his spirit, set forth the case for the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> in a speech suggesting that the Romans were somewhat to blame. But <prn id='Q441474'>Appius</prn> and his colleagues greeted the speech of <prn id='Q2065138'>Lycortas</prn> with jeers, acquitted AreusYY and Alcibiadas of any offence against the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, and permitted the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> to send an embassy to <pl id='Q18287233'>Rome</pl>. Such permission was a contravention of the agreement between the Romans and the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, which allowed the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> as a body to send a deputation to the Roman senate but forbade any city of the <prn id='Q244796'>Achaean League</prn> to send a deputation privately. </p>
<p id='7.9.5'><b>7.9.5</b> A deputation of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> was sent to oppose the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, and after speeches had been delivered by both sides before the senate, the Romans again despatched the same commissioners, <prn id='Q441474'>Appius</prn> and his former colleagues in Greece, to arbitrate between the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> and the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>. This commission restored to <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> those whom the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> had exiled, and they remitted the penalties inflicted by the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> on those who had fled before their trial and had been condemned in their absence. The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> connection with the <prn id='Q244796'>Achaean League</prn> was not broken, but foreign courts were established to deal with capital charges; all other charges were to be submitted for judgment to the <prn id='Q244796'>Achaean League</prn>. The circuit of the city walls was restored by the <pl id='Q5690'>Spartans</pl> right from the foundations. </p>
<p id='7.9.6'><b>7.9.6</b> The restored <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> exiles carried on various intrigues against the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, hoping to vex them most by the following plot. They persuaded to go up to <pl id='Q18287233'>Rome</pl> the exiles of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, along with the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> who had been held to be involved in the death of <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn> and banished on that account by the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>. Going up with them to <pl id='Q18287233'>Rome</pl> they intrigued for the restoration of the exiles. As <prn id='Q441474'>Appius</prn> was a zealous supporter of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> and opposed the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> in everything, the plans of the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> and <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaean</pl> exiles were bound to enjoy an easy success. Despatches were at once sent by the senate to <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> and <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolia</pl>, with instructions to bring back the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> and <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> to their homes. </p>
<p id='7.9.7'><b>7.9.7</b> This caused the greatest vexation to the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>. They bethought themselves of the injustice they had suffered at the hands of the Romans, and how all their services had proved of no avail; to please the Romans they had made war against <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn>, against the <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolians</pl> and afterwards against <prn id='Q3365'>Antiochus</prn>, and after all there was preferred before them a band of exiles, whose hands were stained with blood. Nevertheless, they decided to give way. </p>
<p id='7.10.1'><b>7.10.1</b> Such were the events that took place on this occasion. The most impious of all crimes, the betrayal for private gain of fatherland and fellow-citizens, was destined to be the beginning of woes for the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> as for others, for it has never been absent from Greece since the birth of time. In the reign of <prn id='Q44387'>Dareius</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q379863'>Hystaspes</prn>, the king of <pl id='Q3746183'>Persia</pl>, the cause of the <pl id='Q620874'>Ionians</pl> was ruined because all the <pl id='Q13580795'>Samian</pl> captains except eleven betrayed the <pl id='Q620874'>Ionian</pl> fleet. </p>
<p id='7.10.2'><b>7.10.2</b> After reducing <pl id='Q620874'>Ionia</pl> the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl> enslaved <pl id='Q16562724'>Eretria</pl> also, the most famous citizens turning traitors, PhilagrusYY, the son of Cyneas, and <prn id='Q110297846'>Euphorbus</prn>, the son of AlcimachuYY. When <prn id='Q129165'>Xerxes</prn> invaded Greece, <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessaly</pl> was betrayed by <prn id='Q1693536'>Aleuades</prn>, and <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> by <prn id='Q4818054'>Attaginus</prn> and Timegenidas, who were the foremost citizen of <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>. After the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesian</pl> war, <prn id='Q8043496'>Xenias</prn> of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> attempted to betray <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> to the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> under <prn id='Q299479'>Agis</prn>, </p>
<p id='7.10.3'><b>7.10.3</b> and the so-called “friends” of <prn id='Q143559'>Lysander</prn> at no time relaxed their efforts to hand over their countries to him. In the reign of <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q313907'>Amyntas</prn>, <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl> is the only Greek city to be found that was not betrayed; the other cities in Greece were ruined more by treachery than they had been previously by the <prn id='Q758173'>plague</prn>. <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn>, was so favoured by fortune that he had little need worth mentioning of traitors. </p>
<p id='7.10.4'><b>7.10.4</b> But when the Greeks suffered defeat at <pl id='Q192980'>Lamia</pl>, <prn id='Q204760'>Antipater</prn>, in his eagerness to cross over to the war in <prn id='Q48'>Asia</prn>, wished to patch up a peace quickly, and it mattered nothing to him if he left free <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> and the whole of Greece. But <prn id='Q211430'>Demades</prn> and the other traitors at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> persuaded <prn id='Q204760'>Antipater</prn> to have no kindly thoughts towards the Greeks, and by frightening the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> people were the cause of <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonian</pl> garrisons being brought into <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> and most other cities. </p>
<p id='7.10.5'><b>7.10.5</b> My statement is confirmed by the following fact. The <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> after the disaster in <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl> did not become subjects of <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn>, although they lost two thousand prisoners in the action and one thousand killed. But when about two hundred at most fell at <pl id='Q192980'>Lamia</pl> they were enslaved by the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. So the plague of treachery never failed to afflict Greece, and it was an <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaean</pl>, <prn id='Q114112'>Callicrates</prn>, who at the time I speak of made the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> completely subject to <pl id='Q18287233'>Rome</pl>. But the beginning of their troubles proved to be <prn id='Q207363'>Perseus</prn> and the destruction by the Romans of the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonian</pl> empire. </p>
<p id='7.10.6'><b>7.10.6</b> <prn id='Q207363'>Perseus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn>, who was at peace with <pl id='Q18287233'>Rome</pl> in accordance with a treaty his father <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn> had made, resolved to break the oaths, and leading an army against the <pl id='Q3625075'>Sapaeans</pl> and their king <prn id='Q331602'>Abrupolis</prn>, allies of the Romans, made their country desolate. These <pl id='Q3625075'>Sapaeans</pl> <prn id='Q201323'>Archilochus</prn> mentions in an iambic line. </p>
<p id='7.10.7'><b>7.10.7</b> The <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> and <prn id='Q207363'>Perseus</prn> were conquered because of this wrong done to the <pl id='Q3625075'>Sapaeans</pl>, and afterwards ten Roman senators were sent to arrange the affairs of <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl> in the best interests of the Romans. When they came to Greece, <prn id='Q114112'>Callicrates</prn> curried favour with them, no form of flattery, whether in word or in deed, being too gross for him to use. One member of the commission, a most dishonorable man, <prn id='Q114112'>Callicrates</prn> so captivated that he actually persuaded him to attend the meeting of the <prn id='Q244796'>Achaean League</prn>. </p>
<p id='7.10.8'><b>7.10.8</b> When he entered the assembly he declared that while <prn id='Q207363'>Perseus</prn> was at war with <pl id='Q18287233'>Rome</pl> the most influential <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, besides helping him generally, had supplied him with money. So he required the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> to condemn them to death. After their condemnation, he said, he would himself disclose the names of the culprits. His words were regarded as absolutely unfair, and the members present demanded that, if certain <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> had sided with <prn id='Q207363'>Perseus</prn>, their individual names should be mentioned, it being unreasonable to condemn them before this was done. </p>
<p id='7.10.9'><b>7.10.9</b> Thereupon the Roman, as he was getting the worst of the argument, brazenly asserted that every <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaean</pl> who had held the office of general was included in his accusation, since one and all had favoured the cause of the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> and <prn id='Q207363'>Perseus</prn>. This he said at the bidding of <prn id='Q114112'>Callicrates</prn>. After him rose <prn id='Q11955370'>Xenon</prn>, a man of great repute among the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, and said “The truth about this accusation is as follows. I myself have served the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> as their general, but I am guilty neither of treachery to <pl id='Q18287233'>Rome</pl> nor of friendship to <prn id='Q207363'>Perseus</prn>. I am therefore ready to submit to trial either before the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaean</pl> diet or before the Romans themselves.” This frank speech was prompted by a clear conscience, </p>
<p id='7.10.10'><b>7.10.10</b> but the Roman at once grasped the pretext, and sent for trial before the Roman court all those whom <prn id='Q114112'>Callicrates</prn> accused of supporting <prn id='Q207363'>Perseus</prn>. Never before had Greeks been so treated, for not even the most powerful of the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl>, <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q313907'>Amyntas</prn>, and <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn>, despatched by force to <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl> the Greeks who were opposed to them, but allowed them to plead their case before the <prn id='Q182875'>Amphictyons</prn>. </p>
<p id='7.10.11'><b>7.10.11</b> But on this occasion it was decided to send up to <pl id='Q18287233'>Rome</pl> every one of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaean</pl> people, however innocent, whom <prn id='Q114112'>Callicrates</prn> chose to accuse. They amounted to over a thousand men. The Romans, holding that all these had already been condemned by the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, distributed them throughout <pl id='Q206730'>Etruria</pl> and its cities, and though the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> sent embassy after embassy to plead on behalf of the men, no notice was taken of the petitions. </p>
<p id='7.10.12'><b>7.10.12</b> Sixteen years later, when the number of <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> in <pl id='Q913582'>Italy</pl> was reduced to three hundred at most, the Romans set them free, considering that their punishment was sufficient. But those who ran away, either at once when they were being brought up to <pl id='Q18287233'>Rome</pl>, or later on from the cities to which the Romans sent them, were saved from punishment by no defence if they were recaptured. </p>
<p id='7.11.1'><b>7.11.1</b> The Romans again despatched a senator to Greece. His name was GallusYY, and his instructions were to arbitrate between the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> and the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> in the case of a disputed piece of territory. This GallusYY on many occasions behaved towards the Greek race with great arrogance, both in word and deed, while he made a complete mock of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> and <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>. </p>
<p id='7.11.2'><b>7.11.2</b> These states had reached the highest degree of renown, and in a famous war of old had poured out their blood like water because of a dispute about boundaries, while later <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q313907'>Amyntas</prn>, had acted as arbitrator to settle their differences; yet now GallusYY disdained to arbitrate in person, and entrusted the decision to <prn id='Q114112'>Callicrates</prn>, the most abominable wretch in all Greece. </p>
<p id='7.11.3'><b>7.11.3</b> There also came to GallusYY the <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolians</pl> living at <pl id='Q45793176'>Pleuron</pl>, who wished to detach themselves from the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaean</pl> confederacy. GallusYY allowed them to send on their own an embassy to <pl id='Q18287233'>Rome</pl>, and the Romans allowed them to secede from the <prn id='Q244796'>Achaean League</prn>. The senate also commissioned GallusYY to separate from the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaean</pl> confederacy as many states as he could. </p>
<p id='7.11.4'><b>7.11.4</b> While he was carrying out his instructions, the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> populace sacked <pl id='Q18073696'>Oropus</pl>, a state subject to them. The act was one of necessity rather than of free-will, as the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> at the time suffered the direst poverty, because the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonian</pl> war had crushed them more than any other Greeks. So the <pl id='Q18073696'>Oropians</pl> appealed to the Roman senate. It decided that an injustice had been committed, and instructed the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl> to inflict a fine on the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> commensurate with the unprovoked harm done by them to <pl id='Q18073696'>Oropus</pl>. </p>
<p id='7.11.5'><b>7.11.5</b> When the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> did not appear in time for the trial, the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl> inflicted on them a fine of five hundred talents, which the Roman senate on the appeal of the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> remitted with the exception of one hundred talents. Not even this reduced fine did the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> pay, but by promises and bribes they beguiled the <pl id='Q18073696'>Oropians</pl> into an agreement that an <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> garrison should enter <pl id='Q18073696'>Oropus</pl>, and that the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> should take hostages from the <pl id='Q18073696'>Oropians</pl>. If in the future the <pl id='Q18073696'>Oropians</pl> should have any complaint to make against the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, then the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> were to withdraw their garrison from <pl id='Q18073696'>Oropus</pl> and give the hostages back again. </p>
<p id='7.11.6'><b>7.11.6</b> After no long interval the <pl id='Q18073696'>Oropians</pl> were wronged by certain of the garrison. They accordingly despatched envoys to <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> to ask for the restoration of their hostages and to request that the garrison be withdrawn according to the agreement. The <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> refused to do either of these things, saying that the blame lay, not with the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> people, but with the men of the garrison. They promised, however, that the culprits should he brought to account. </p>
<p id='7.11.7'><b>7.11.7</b> The <pl id='Q18073696'>Oropians</pl> then appealed to the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> for aid, but these refused to give it out of friendship and respect for the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>. Thereupon the <pl id='Q18073696'>Oropians</pl> promised <prn id='Q4290299'>Menalcidas</prn>, a <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> who was then general of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, a gift of ten talents if he would induce the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> to help them. <prn id='Q4290299'>Menalcidas</prn> promised half of the money to <prn id='Q114112'>Callicrates</prn>, who on account of his friendship with the Romans had most influence among the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>. </p>
<p id='7.11.8'><b>7.11.8</b> <prn id='Q114112'>Callicrates</prn> was persuaded to adopt the plan of <prn id='Q4290299'>Menalcidas</prn>, and it was decided to help the <pl id='Q18073696'>Oropians</pl> against the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>. News of this was brought to the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, who, with all the speed each could, came to <pl id='Q18073696'>Oropus</pl>, again dragged away anything they had overlooked in the previous raids, and brought away the garrison. As the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> were too late to render help, <prn id='Q4290299'>Menalcidas</prn> and <prn id='Q114112'>Callicrates</prn> urged them to invade <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl>. But they met with opposition, especially from <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl>, and the army withdrew. </p>
<p id='7.12.1'><b>7.12.1</b> Though the <pl id='Q18073696'>Oropians</pl> had received no help from the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, nevertheless <prn id='Q4290299'>Menalcidas</prn> extorted the money from them. But when he had the bribe in his hands, he began to think it hard luck that he had to share his gains with <prn id='Q114112'>Callicrates</prn>. At first he had recourse to procrastination and deceit about payment, but shortly he plucked up courage and flatly refused to give anything. </p>
<p id='7.12.2'><b>7.12.2</b> It confirms the truth of the proverb that one fire burns more fiercely than another, one <prn id='Q18498'>wolf</prn> is more savage than other <prn id='Q18498'>wolves</prn>, one hawk swifter than another, that <prn id='Q4290299'>Menalcidas</prn> outdid in treachery <prn id='Q114112'>Callicrates</prn>, the worst rascal of his time, one who could never resist a bribe of any kind. He fell foul of the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> without gaining anything, and, when <prn id='Q4290299'>Menalcidas</prn> laid down his office, accused him before the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> on a capital charge. He said that <prn id='Q4290299'>Menalcidas</prn>, when on an embassy to <pl id='Q18287233'>Rome</pl>, had worked against the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> and had done all he could to separate <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> from the <prn id='Q244796'>Achaean League</prn>. </p>
<p id='7.12.3'><b>7.12.3</b> Thereupon, as the danger he ran was extreme, <prn id='Q4290299'>Menalcidas</prn> gave three of the talents he received from <pl id='Q18073696'>Oropus</pl> to <prn id='Q2066030'>Diaeus</prn> of <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl>, who had succeeded him as general of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, and on this occasion was so active, because of the bribe, that he succeeded in saving <prn id='Q4290299'>Menalcidas</prn> in spite of the opposition of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>. The <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, individually and as a body, held <prn id='Q2066030'>Diaeus</prn> responsible for the acquittal of <prn id='Q4290299'>Menalcidas</prn>, but he distracted their attention from the charges made against him by directing it towards more ambitious hopes, using to deceive them the following pretext. </p>
<p id='7.12.4'><b>7.12.4</b> The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> appealed to the Roman senate about a disputed territory, and the senate replied to the appeal by decreeing that all except capital cases should be under the jurisdiction of the <prn id='Q244796'>Achaean League</prn>. Such was the senate's answer, but <prn id='Q2066030'>Diaeus</prn> did not tell the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> the truth, but cajoled them by the declaration that the Roman senate had committed to them the right to condemn a <pl id='Q5690'>Spartan</pl> to death. </p>
<p id='7.12.5'><b>7.12.5</b> So the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> claimed the right to try a <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> on a capital charge, but the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> would not admit that <prn id='Q2066030'>Diaeus</prn> spoke the truth, and wished to refer the point to the Roman senate. But the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> seized another pretext, that no state belonging to the <prn id='Q244796'>Achaean League</prn> had the right to send an embassy on its own to the Roman senate, but only in conjunction with the rest of the League. </p>
<p id='7.12.6'><b>7.12.6</b> These disputes were the cause of a war between the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> and the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, and the former, realizing that they were not a match for their opponents, sent envoys to their cities and entered into personal negotiations with <prn id='Q2066030'>Diaeus</prn>. The cities all made the same reply, that it was unlawful to turn a deaf ear to their general when he proclaimed a campaign; for <prn id='Q2066030'>Diaeus</prn>, who was in command of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, declared that he would march to make war, not on <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> but on those that were troubling her. </p>
<p id='7.12.7'><b>7.12.7</b> When the <pl id='Q5690'>Spartan</pl> senate inquired how many he considered were guilty, he reported to them the names of twenty-four citizens of the very front rank in <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>. Thereupon was carried a motion of Agasisthenes, whose advice on this occasion enhanced the already great reputation he enjoyed. He bade the twenty-four to go into voluntary exile from <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl>, instead of bringing war upon <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> by remaining where they were; if they exiled themselves to <pl id='Q18287233'>Rome</pl>, he declared, they would before long be restored to their country by the Romans. </p>
<p id='7.12.8'><b>7.12.8</b> So they departed, underwent a nominal trial at <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>, and were condemned to death. The <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> on their side despatched to <pl id='Q18287233'>Rome</pl> <prn id='Q114112'>Callicrates</prn> and <prn id='Q2066030'>Diaeus</prn> to oppose the exiles from <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> before the senate. <prn id='Q114112'>Callicrates</prn> died of disease on the journey, and even if he had reached <pl id='Q18287233'>Rome</pl> I do not know that he would have been of any assistance to the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> — perhaps he would have been the cause of greater troubles. The debate between <prn id='Q2066030'>Diaeus</prn> and <prn id='Q4290299'>Menalcidas</prn> before the senate was marked by fluency rather than by decency on either side. </p>
<p id='7.12.9'><b>7.12.9</b> The answer of the senate to their remarks was that they were sending envoys to settle the disputes between the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> and the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>. The journey of the envoys from <pl id='Q18287233'>Rome</pl> proved rather slow, giving <prn id='Q2066030'>Diaeus</prn> a fresh opportunity of deceiving the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> and <prn id='Q4290299'>Menalcidas</prn> of deceiving the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. <prn id='Q2066030'>Diaeus</prn> misled the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> into the belief that the Roman senate had decreed the complete subjection to them of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>; <prn id='Q4290299'>Menalcidas</prn> deceived the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> into thinking that the Romans had entirely freed them from the <prn id='Q244796'>Achaean League</prn>. </p>
<p id='7.13.1'><b>7.13.1</b> So the result of the debate was that the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> again came near to actual war with the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, and <prn id='Q4154428'>Damocritus</prn>, who had been elected general of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> at this time, proceeded to mobilize an army against <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>. But about this time there arrived in <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl> a Roman force under <prn id='Q355768'>Metellus</prn>, whose object was to put down the rebellion of <prn id='Q362068'>Andriscus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q207363'>Perseus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn>. The war in <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl>, it turned out, was easily decided in favour of the Romans, </p>
<p id='7.13.2'><b>7.13.2</b> but <prn id='Q355768'>Metellus</prn> urged the envoys, sent by the Roman senate to settle the affairs of <prn id='Q48'>Asia</prn>, to parley with the chiefs of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> before making the crossing. They were to order them not to attack <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>, but to await the arrival from <pl id='Q18287233'>Rome</pl> of the envoys sent for the purpose of arbitrating between the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> and the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>. </p>
<p id='7.13.3'><b>7.13.3</b> They delivered their instructions to the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> under <prn id='Q4154428'>Damocritus</prn> when these had already begun a campaign against <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl>, and so, realizing that the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> were set against their advice, proceeded on their way to <prn id='Q48'>Asia</prn>. The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, with a spirit greater than their strength, took up arms, and sallied forth to defend their country. But they were soon crushed; a thousand of their bravest youths fell in the battle, and the rest of the soldiery fled towards the city with all the haste they could. </p>
<p id='7.13.4'><b>7.13.4</b> If <prn id='Q4154428'>Damocritus</prn> had made a vigorous effort, the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> could have dashed into the walls of <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> along with the fugitives from the field of battle. As it was, he at once recalled the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> from the pursuit, and confined his future operations to raids and plunder, instead of prosecuting the siege with energy. </p>
<p id='7.13.5'><b>7.13.5</b> So <prn id='Q4154428'>Damocritus</prn> withdrew his army, and the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> sentenced him to pay a fine of fifty talents for his treachery. Being unable to pay, he left the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl> and went into exile. <prn id='Q2066030'>Diaeus</prn>, who was elected general after <prn id='Q4154428'>Damocritus</prn>, agreed, when <prn id='Q355768'>Metellus</prn> sent another embassy, to involve the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> in no war, but to await the arrival of the arbitrators from <pl id='Q18287233'>Rome</pl>. </p>
<p id='7.13.6'><b>7.13.6</b> But he invented another trick to embarrass the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. He induced the towns around <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> to be friendly to the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, and even introduced garrisons into them, to be <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaean</pl> bases against <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>. </p>
<p id='7.13.7'><b>7.13.7</b> The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> elected <prn id='Q4290299'>Menalcidas</prn> to be their general against <prn id='Q2066030'>Diaeus</prn>, and although they were utterly unprepared for war, being especially ill-provided with money, while in addition their land had remained unsown, he nevertheless dared to break the truce, and took by assault and sacked IasusYY, a town on the borders of <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconia</pl>, but at that time subject to the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>. </p>
<p id='7.13.8'><b>7.13.8</b> Having again stirred up war between <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> and <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> he incurred blame at the hands of his countrymen, and, failing to find a way of escape for the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> from the peril that threatened them, he took his own life by poison. Such was the end of <prn id='Q4290299'>Menalcidas</prn>. At the time he was in command of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, and previously he had commanded the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>. In the former office he proved a most stupid general, in the latter an unparalleled villain. </p>
<p id='7.14.1'><b>7.14.1</b> There also arrived in Greece the envoys despatched from <pl id='Q18287233'>Rome</pl> to arbitrate between the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> and the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, among them being <prn id='Q192407'>Orestes</prn>. He invited to visit him the magistrates in each of the Greek cities, along with <prn id='Q2066030'>Diaeus</prn>. When they arrived at his lodging, he proceeded to disclose to them the whole story, that the Roman senate decreed that neither the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> nor yet <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl> itself should belong to the <prn id='Q244796'>Achaean League</prn>, and that <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>, <pl id='Q1231448'>Heracleia</pl> by Mount <pl id='Q132378'>Oeta</pl> and the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadian</pl> <pl id='Q1855083'>Orchomenus</pl> should be released from the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaean</pl> confederacy. For they were not, he said, related at all to the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, and but late-comers to the League. </p>
<p id='7.14.2'><b>7.14.2</b> The magistrates of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> did not wait for <prn id='Q192407'>Orestes</prn> to conclude, but while he was yet speaking ran out of the house and summoned the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> to an assembly. When the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> heard the decision of the Romans, they at once turned against the <pl id='Q5690'>Spartans</pl> who happened to be then residing in <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl>, and arrested every one, not only those whom they knew for certain to be <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, but also all those they suspected to be such from the cut of their hair, or because of their shoes, their clothes or even their names. Some of them, who succeeded in taking refuge in the lodging of <prn id='Q192407'>Orestes</prn>, they actually attempted even from there to drag away by force. </p>
<p id='7.14.3'><b>7.14.3</b> <prn id='Q192407'>Orestes</prn> and his colleagues tried to check their violence, reminding them that they were committing unprovoked acts of criminal insolence against the Romans. A few days afterwards the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> shut up in prison the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> they held under arrest, but separated from them the foreigners and let them go. They also despatched to <pl id='Q18287233'>Rome</pl> ThearidasYY, with certain other members of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaean</pl> government. These set out, but meeting on the journey the Roman envoys who had been sent after <prn id='Q192407'>Orestes</prn> to deal with the dispute between the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> and the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, they too turned back. </p>
<p id='7.14.4'><b>7.14.4</b> When the time came for <prn id='Q2066030'>Diaeus</prn> to relinquish his office, <prn id='Q1073837'>Critolaus</prn> was elected general by the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>. This <prn id='Q1073837'>Critolaus</prn> was seized with a keen but utterly unthinking passion to make war against the Romans. The envoys from the Romans had by this time already arrived to adjudicate on the dispute between the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> and the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, and <prn id='Q1073837'>Critolaus</prn> had a conference with them at <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl> in <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl>, being most unwilling to summon the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> to meet them in a general assembly. However, in the hearing of the Romans he sent messengers with instructions to summon the deputies to the assembly, but privately he sent orders to the deputies of the various cities to absent themselves from the meeting. </p>
<p id='7.14.5'><b>7.14.5</b> When the deputies did not attend, <prn id='Q1073837'>Critolaus</prn> showed very clearly how he was hoodwinking the Romans. He urged them to wait for another meeting of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, to take place five months later, declaring that he would not confer with them without the general assembly of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>. When the envoys realized that they were being deceived, they departed for <pl id='Q18287233'>Rome</pl> but <prn id='Q1073837'>Critolaus</prn> summoned a meeting of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> at <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl>, and persuaded them both to take up arms against <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> and also to declare war openly on <pl id='Q18287233'>Rome</pl>. </p>
<p id='7.14.6'><b>7.14.6</b> For a king or state to undertake a war and be unlucky is due to the jealousy of some divinity rather than to the fault of the combatants; but audacity combined with weakness should be called madness rather than ill-luck. But it was such a combination that overthrew <prn id='Q1073837'>Critolaus</prn> and the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>. The <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> were also encouraged by <prn id='Q12884001'>Pytheas</prn>, who at that time was <prn id='Q1019919'>Boeotarch</prn> at <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>, and the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> promised to give enthusiastic support in the war. </p>
<p id='7.14.7'><b>7.14.7</b> The <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> had been sentenced, at the first ruling given by <prn id='Q355768'>Metellus</prn>, to pay a fine for invading the territory of <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl> with an armed force; at the second to compensate the <pl id='Q173096'>Euboeans</pl> for laying waste <pl id='Q173096'>Euboea</pl>; at the third to compensate the people of <pl id='Q38281545'>Amphissa</pl> for ravaging their territory when the corn was ripe for harvest. </p>
<p id='7.15.1'><b>7.15.1</b> The Romans, learning the news from the envoys sent to Greece and from the despatches of <prn id='Q355768'>Metellus</prn>, decided that the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> were in the wrong, and they ordered <prn id='Q445455'>Mummius</prn>, the consul elected for that year, to lead a fleet with a land force against them. As soon as <prn id='Q355768'>Metellus</prn> learned that <prn id='Q445455'>Mummius</prn> and his army were coming to fight the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, he was full of enthusiasm to bring the war to a conclusion without help before <prn id='Q445455'>Mummius</prn> reached Greece. </p>
<p id='7.15.2'><b>7.15.2</b> So he despatched envoys to the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, bidding them release from the League the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> and the other states mentioned in the order of the Romans, promising that the Romans would entirely forgive them for their disobedience on the previous occasion. While making these proposals for peace he marched from <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl> through <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessaly</pl> and along the gulf of <pl id='Q192980'>Lamia</pl>. But <prn id='Q1073837'>Critolaus</prn> and the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> would listen to no suggestions for an agreement, and sat down to besiege <pl id='Q1231448'>Heracleia</pl>, which refused to join the <prn id='Q244796'>Achaean League</prn>. </p>
<p id='7.15.3'><b>7.15.3</b> Then, when <prn id='Q1073837'>Critolaus</prn> was informed by his scouts that the Romans under <prn id='Q355768'>Metellus</prn> had crossed the <pl id='Q426309'>Spercheius</pl>, he fled to <pl id='Q3475188'>Scarpheia</pl> in <pl id='Q3354839'>Locris</pl>, without daring even to draw up the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> in the pass between <pl id='Q1231448'>Heracleia</pl> and <pl id='Q194450'>Thermopylae</pl>, and to await <prn id='Q355768'>Metellus</prn> there. To such a depth of terror did he sink that brighter hopes were not suggested even by the spot itself, the site of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> effort to save Greece, and of the no less glorious exploit of the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> against the Gauls. </p>
<p id='7.15.4'><b>7.15.4</b> <prn id='Q1073837'>Critolaus</prn> and the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> took to flight, but at a short distance from <pl id='Q3475188'>Scarpheia</pl> they were overtaken by the men of <prn id='Q355768'>Metellus</prn>, who killed many and took about a thousand prisoners. <prn id='Q1073837'>Critolaus</prn> was neither seen alive after the battle nor found among the dead. If he dared to plunge into the marsh of the sea at the foot of Mount <pl id='Q132378'>Oeta</pl> he must inevitably have sunk into the depths without leaving a trace to tell the tale. </p>
<p id='7.15.5'><b>7.15.5</b> So the end of <prn id='Q1073837'>Critolaus</prn> offers a wide field for conjecture. A thousand picked troops of <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl>, who had joined <prn id='Q1073837'>Critolaus</prn> in his enterprise, took the field and advanced as far as <pl id='Q1235347'>Elateia</pl> in <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl>, into which city they were received by the inhabitants on the ground of some supposed ancient connection between them. But when the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> heard of the disaster to <prn id='Q1073837'>Critolaus</prn> and the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, they ordered the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> to depart from <pl id='Q1235347'>Elateia</pl>. </p>
<p id='7.15.6'><b>7.15.6</b> As they were retreating to the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl> the Romans under <prn id='Q355768'>Metellus</prn> fell upon them near <pl id='Q13574678'>Chaeroneia</pl>. It was then that the vengeance of the Greek gods overtook the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl>, who were slain by the Romans on the very spot on which they had deserted from the Greeks who were struggling at <pl id='Q13574678'>Chaeroneia</pl> against the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> under <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn>. </p>
<p id='7.15.7'><b>7.15.7</b> <prn id='Q2066030'>Diaeus</prn> once more came forward to command the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaean</pl> army. He proceeded to set free slaves, following the example of <prn id='Q210350'>Miltiades</prn> and the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> before the battle of <pl id='Q31900'>Marathon</pl>, and enlisted from the cities of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> and <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> those who were of military age. The muster, including the slaves, amounted roughly to six hundred cavalry and fourteen thousand foot. </p>
<p id='7.15.8'><b>7.15.8</b> And here <prn id='Q2066030'>Diaeus</prn> sank into utter folly. Although he knew that <prn id='Q1073837'>Critolaus</prn> and the whole force of <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaia</pl> had put up such a poor fight against <prn id='Q355768'>Metellus</prn>, he nevertheless detached about four thousand, put them under the command of AlcamenesYY, and despatched them to <pl id='Q42307600'>Megara</pl> to garrison the city, and to stay the advance of <prn id='Q355768'>Metellus</prn> and the Romans, should they march that way. </p>
<p id='7.15.9'><b>7.15.9</b> When the picked <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadian</pl> troops had been overthrown near <pl id='Q13574678'>Chaeroneia</pl>, <prn id='Q355768'>Metellus</prn> moved his army and marched against <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>, for the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> had joined the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> in investing <pl id='Q1231448'>Heracleia</pl>, and had taken part in the engagement of <pl id='Q3475188'>Scarpheia</pl>. Then the inhabitants, of both sexes and of all ages, abandoned the city and wandered about <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl>, or took refuge on the tops of the mountains. </p>
<p id='7.15.10'><b>7.15.10</b> But <prn id='Q355768'>Metellus</prn> would not allow either the burning of sanctuaries of the gods or the destruction of buildings, and he forbade his men to kill any <pl id='Q11225429'>Theban</pl> or take prisoner any fugitive. If, however, <prn id='Q12884001'>Pytheas</prn> should be caught, he was to be brought before him. <prn id='Q12884001'>Pytheas</prn> was discovered immediately, brought before <prn id='Q355768'>Metellus</prn> and punished. When the army approached <pl id='Q42307600'>Megara</pl>, AlcamenesYY and his men did not face it, but straightway fled to the camp of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> at <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl>. </p>
<p id='7.15.11'><b>7.15.11</b> The <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarians</pl> surrendered their city to the Romans without a blow, and when <prn id='Q355768'>Metellus</prn> came to the <pl id='Q215200'>Isthmus</pl> he again made overtures to the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> for an agreed peace. For he was possessed of a strong desire to settle by himself the affairs of both <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl> and <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaia</pl>. His efforts, however, were thwarted by the senselessness of <prn id='Q2066030'>Diaeus</prn>. </p>
<p id='7.16.1'><b>7.16.1</b> <prn id='Q445455'>Mummius</prn>, bringing with him <prn id='Q192407'>Orestes</prn>, the commissioner sent earlier to deal with the dispute between the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> and the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, reached the Roman army at early dawn, and sending <prn id='Q355768'>Metellus</prn> and his forces to <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl>, himself waited at the <pl id='Q215200'>Isthmus</pl> for his whole force to assemble. There came three thousand five hundred cavalry, while the infantry amounted to twenty-three thousand. They were joined by a company of <pl id='Q4752820'>Cretan</pl> archers and by <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn>, at the head of some troops sent by <prn id='Q110745'>Attalus</prn> from <pl id='Q18986'>Pergamus</pl> on the <pl id='Q1737602'>Caicus</pl>. </p>
<p id='7.16.2'><b>7.16.2</b> Certain of the <pl id='Q913582'>Italian</pl> troops along with the auxiliaries were stationed by <prn id='Q445455'>Mummius</prn> twelve stades away, to be an outpost for the whole army. The contempt of the Romans made them keep a careless look-out, and the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, attacking them in the first watch, killed some, drove yet more back to the camp, and took some five hundred shields. Puffed up with this success the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> marched out to battle before the Romans began their attack. </p>
<p id='7.16.3'><b>7.16.3</b> But when <prn id='Q445455'>Mummius</prn> advanced to meet them, the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaean</pl> <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn> at once took to flight, without waiting for even the first charge of the Roman cavalry. The infantry were depressed at the rout of their <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn>, but nevertheless received the onslaught of the Roman men-at-arms; overwhelmed by numbers and faint with their wounds they offered a spirited resistance, until a thousand picked Romans fell upon their flank and utterly routed them. </p>
<p id='7.16.4'><b>7.16.4</b> If after the battle <prn id='Q2066030'>Diaeus</prn> had boldly thrown himself into <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl> and received the fugitives within the walls, the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> might have been able to get favorable terms from <prn id='Q445455'>Mummius</prn>, by putting him to the trouble of a protracted siege. As it was, when the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> were but beginning to yield, <prn id='Q2066030'>Diaeus</prn> fled straight for <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl>, his conduct towards the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> showing a marked contrast to that of <prn id='Q531775'>Callistratus</prn>, the son of Empedus, towards the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>. </p>
<p id='7.16.5'><b>7.16.5</b> This man commanded some cavalry in <pl id='Q4951156'>Sicily</pl>, and when the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> and their partners in the expedition were being massacred at the river <pl id='Q2292234'>Asinarus</pl>, he courageously cut a way through the enemy at the head of his horsemen. He brought most of them safe to Catana, and then returned by the same way back to <pl id='Q4420718'>Syracuse</pl>. Finding the enemy still plundering the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> camp, he cut down some five of them, and then both he and his <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn> received mortal wounds and died. </p>
<p id='7.16.6'><b>7.16.6</b> So he won glory for the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> and for himself, by saving the men under his command and seeking his own death. But <prn id='Q2066030'>Diaeus</prn> having ruined the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> came to tell the tidings of disaster to the people of <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl>, killed his wife with his own hand, just to save her from being taken prisoner, and then committed suicide by drinking poison. He may be compared to <prn id='Q4290299'>Menalcidas</prn> for his avarice, and proved equally like him in the cowardice of his death. </p>
<p id='7.16.7'><b>7.16.7</b> As soon as night fell, the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> who had escaped to <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl> after the battle fled from the city, and there fled with them most of the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthians</pl> themselves. At first <prn id='Q445455'>Mummius</prn> hesitated to enter <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl>, although the gates were open, as he suspected that an ambush had been laid within the walls. But on the third day after the battle he proceeded to storm <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl> and to set it on fire. </p>
<p id='7.16.8'><b>7.16.8</b> The majority of those found in it were put to the sword by the Romans, but the women and children <prn id='Q445455'>Mummius</prn> sold into slavery. He also sold all the slaves who had been set free, had fought on the side of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, and had not fallen at once on the field of battle. The most admired votive offerings and works of art were carried off by <prn id='Q445455'>Mummius</prn>; those of less account he gave to <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn>, the general sent by <prn id='Q110745'>Attalus</prn>; even in my day there were <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthian</pl> spoils at <pl id='Q18986'>Pergamus</pl>. </p>
<p id='7.16.9'><b>7.16.9</b> The walls of all the cities that had made war against <pl id='Q18287233'>Rome</pl> <prn id='Q445455'>Mummius</prn> demolished, disarming the inhabitants, even before assistant commissioners were despatched from <pl id='Q18287233'>Rome</pl>, and when these did arrive, he proceeded to put down democracies and to establish governments based on a property qualification. Tribute was imposed on Greece, and those with property were forbidden to acquire possessions in a foreign country. Racial confederacies, whether of <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, or <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl>, or <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotians</pl>, or of any other Greek people, were one and all put down. </p>
<p id='7.16.10'><b>7.16.10</b> A few years later the Romans took pity on Greece, restored the various old racial confederacies, with the right to acquire property in a foreign country, and remitted the fines imposed by <prn id='Q445455'>Mummius</prn>. For he had ordered the <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotians</pl> to pay a hundred talents to the people of <pl id='Q1231448'>Heracleia</pl> and <pl id='Q173096'>Euboea</pl>, and the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> to pay two hundred to the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. Although the Romans granted the Greeks remission of these payments, yet down to my day a Roman governor has been sent to the country. The Romans call him the Governor, not of Greece, but of <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaia</pl>, because the cause of the subjection of Greece was the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, at that time at the head of the Greek nation. This war came to an end when AntitheusYY [unknown] was archon at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, in the <prn id='Q57337868'>hundred and sixtieth Olympiad</prn> [140 BCE], at which <prn id='Q21809776'>Diodorus</prn> of <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl> was victorious. </p>
<p id='7.17.1'><b>7.17.1</b> It was at this time that Greece was struck with universal and utter prostration, although parts of it from the beginning had suffered ruin and devastation at the hand of heaven. <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>, a city that reached the zenith of its power in the days of the heroes, as they are called, was deserted by its good fortune at the <prn id='Q203711'>Dorian</prn> revolution. </p>
<p id='7.17.2'><b>7.17.2</b> The people of <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl>, reviving after the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesian</pl> war and the <prn id='Q758173'>plague</prn>, raised themselves again only to be struck down a few years later by the ascendancy of <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl>. From <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl> the wrath of <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn> swooped like a thunderbolt on <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> of <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl>. The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> suffered injury through <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn> of <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> and again through the war with the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>. And when painfully, like a shoot from a mutilated and mostly withered trunk, the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaean</pl> power sprang up, it was cut short, while still growing, by the cowardice of its generals. </p>
<p id='7.17.3'><b>7.17.3</b> At a later time, when the Roman imperial power devolved upon <prn id='Q1413'>Nero</prn>, he gave to the Roman people the very prosperous island of <pl id='Q3760293'>Sardinia</pl> in exchange for Greece, and then bestowed upon the latter complete freedom. When I considered this act of <prn id='Q1413'>Nero</prn> it struck me how true is the remark of <prn id='Q859'>Plato</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q667017'>Ariston</prn>, who says that the greatest and most daring crimes are committed, not by ordinary men, but by a noble soul ruined by a perverted education. </p>
<p id='7.17.4'><b>7.17.4</b> The Greeks, however, were not to profit by the gift. For in the reign of <prn id='Q1419'>Vespasian</prn>, the next emperor after <prn id='Q1413'>Nero</prn>, they became embroiled in a civil war; <prn id='Q1419'>Vespasian</prn> ordered that they should again pay tribute and be subject to a governor, saying that the Greek people had forgotten how to be free. </p>
<p id='7.17.5'><b>7.17.5</b> To resume after my researches into <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaean</pl> history. The boundary between <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaia</pl> and <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> is the river <pl id='Q3362574'>Larisus</pl>, and by the river is a temple of Larisaean <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>; about thirty stades distant from the <pl id='Q3362574'>Larisus</pl> is <pl id='Q1231662'>Dyme</pl>, an <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaean</pl> city. This was the only <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaean</pl> city that in his wars <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn> the son of <prn id='Q59734'>Demetrius</prn> made subject to him, and for this reason <prn id='Q659723'>Sulpicius</prn>, another Roman governor, handed over <pl id='Q1231662'>Dyme</pl> to be sacked by his soldiery. Afterwards <prn id='Q1405'>Augustus</prn> annexed it to <pl id='Q133123'>Patrae</pl>. </p>
<p id='7.17.6'><b>7.17.6</b> Its more ancient name was PaleiaYY, but the <pl id='Q620874'>Ionians</pl> changed this to its modern name while they still occupied the city; I am uncertain whether they named it after Dyme, a native woman, or after <prn id='Q17486771'>Dymas</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q404326'>Aegimius</prn>. But nobody is likely to be led into a fallacy by the inscription on the statue of <prn id='Q3717869'>Oebotas</prn> at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>. <prn id='Q3717869'>Oebotas</prn> was a man of <pl id='Q1231662'>Dyme</pl>, who won the foot-race at the <prn id='Q57337661'>sixth Olympiad</prn> [756 BCE] and was honored, because of a <prn id='Q682558'>Delphic oracle</prn>, with a statue erected in the <prn id='Q57337763'>eightieth Olympiad</prn> [460 BCE]. On it is an inscription which says: </p>
<p id='7.17.7'><b>7.17.7</b> “This <prn id='Q3717869'>Oebotas</prn>, an <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaean</pl>, the son of Oenias, by winning the foot-race, Added to the renown of his fatherland PaleiaYY.” This inscription should mislead nobody, although it calls the city PaleiaYY and not <pl id='Q1231662'>Dyme</pl>. For it is the custom of Greek poets to use ancient names instead of more modern ones, just as they surname <prn id='Q330584'>Amphiaraus</prn> and <prn id='Q223152'>Adrastus</prn> Phoronids, and <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> an ErechthYY. </p>
<p id='7.17.8'><b>7.17.8</b> A little before the city of <pl id='Q1231662'>Dyme</pl> there is, on the right of the road, the grave of <prn id='Q22965580'>Sostratus</prn>. He was a native youth, loved they say by <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, who outliving <prn id='Q22965580'>Sostratus</prn> made him his tomb and gave him some hair from his head as a primal offering. Even today there is a slab on the top of the mound, with a figure of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> in relief. I was told that the natives also sacrifice to <prn id='Q22965580'>Sostratus</prn> as to a hero. </p>
<p id='7.17.9'><b>7.17.9</b> The people of <pl id='Q1231662'>Dyme</pl> have a temple of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> with an extremely ancient image; they have as well a sanctuary built for the <pl id='Q5278019'>Dindymenian</pl> <prn id='Q334486'>Mother</prn> and <prn id='Q262016'>Attis</prn>. As to <prn id='Q262016'>Attis</prn>, I could learn no secret about him, but <prn id='Q1613558'>Hermesianax</prn>, the elegiac poet, says in a poem that he was the son of Galaus the <pl id='Q32579'>Phrygian</pl>, and that he was a eunuch from birth. The account of <prn id='Q1613558'>Hermesianax</prn> goes on to say that, on growing up, <prn id='Q262016'>Attis</prn> migrated to <pl id='Q620765'>Lydia</pl> and celebrated for the <pl id='Q620765'>Lydians</pl> the orgies of the <prn id='Q334486'>Mother</prn>; that he rose to such honor with her that <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, being wroth at it, sent a <prn id='Q58697'>boar</prn> to destroy the tillage of the <pl id='Q620765'>Lydians</pl>. </p>
<p id='7.17.10'><b>7.17.10</b> Then certain <pl id='Q620765'>Lydians</pl>, with <prn id='Q262016'>Attis</prn> himself, were killed by the <prn id='Q58697'>boar</prn>, and it is consistent with this that the Gauls who inhabit <pl id='Q728353'>Pessinus</pl> abstain from pork. But the current view about <prn id='Q262016'>Attis</prn> is different, the local legend about him being this. <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, it is said, let fall in his sleep seed upon the ground, which in course of time sent up a demon, with two sexual organs, male and female. They call the demon <prn id='Q392120'>Agdistis</prn>. But the gods, fearing <prn id='Q392120'>Agdistis</prn>, cut off the male organ. </p>
<p id='7.17.11'><b>7.17.11</b> There grew up from it an almond-tree with its fruit ripe, and a daughter of the river <pl id='Q217466'>Sangarius</pl>, they say, took of the fruit and laid it in her bosom, when it at once disappeared, but she was with child. A boy was born, and exposed, but was tended by a he-<prn id='Q2934'>goat</prn>. As he grew up his beauty was more than human, and <prn id='Q392120'>Agdistis</prn> fell in love with him. When he had grown up, <prn id='Q262016'>Attis</prn> was sent by his relatives to <pl id='Q728353'>Pessinus</pl>, that he might wed the king's daughter. </p>
<p id='7.17.12'><b>7.17.12</b> The marriage-song was being sung, when <prn id='Q392120'>Agdistis</prn> appeared, and <prn id='Q262016'>Attis</prn> went mad and cut off his genitals, as also did he who was giving him his daughter in marriage. But <prn id='Q392120'>Agdistis</prn> repented of what he had done to <prn id='Q262016'>Attis</prn>, and persuaded <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> to grant that the body of <prn id='Q262016'>Attis</prn> should neither rot at all nor decay. </p>
<p id='7.17.13'><b>7.17.13</b> These are the most popular forms of the legend of <prn id='Q262016'>Attis</prn>. In the territory of <pl id='Q1231662'>Dyme</pl> is also the grave of <prn id='Q3717869'>Oebotas</prn> the runner. Although this <prn id='Q3717869'>Oebotas</prn> was the first <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaean</pl> to win an <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> victory, he yet received from them no special prize. Wherefore <prn id='Q3717869'>Oebotas</prn> pronounced a curse that no <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaean</pl> in future should win an <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> victory. There must have been some god who was careful that the curse of <prn id='Q3717869'>Oebotas</prn> should be fulfilled, but the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> by sending to <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> at last learned why it was that they had been failing to win the <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> crown. </p>
<p id='7.17.14'><b>7.17.14</b> So they dedicated the statue of <prn id='Q3717869'>Oebotas</prn> at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> and honored him in other ways, and then <prn id='Q3965190'>Sostratus</prn> of <pl id='Q2068130'>Pellene</pl> won the footrace for boys. It is still today a custom for the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> who are going to compete at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> to sacrifice to <prn id='Q3717869'>Oebotas</prn> as to a hero, and, if they are successful, to place a wreath on the statue of <prn id='Q3717869'>Oebotas</prn> at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>. </p>
<p id='7.18.1'><b>7.18.1</b> Some forty stades from <pl id='Q1231662'>Dyme</pl> the river <pl id='Q3555219'>Peiros</pl> flows down into the sea; on the <pl id='Q3555219'>Peiros</pl> once stood the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaean</pl> city of <pl id='Q11939304'>Olenus</pl>. The poets who have sung of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> and his labours have found a favorite subject in <prn id='Q3706015'>Dexamenus</prn>, king of <pl id='Q11939304'>Olenus</pl>, and the entertainment <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> received at his court. That <pl id='Q11939304'>Olenus</pl> was from the beginning a small town I find confirmed in an elegiac poem composed by <prn id='Q1613558'>Hermesianax</prn> about <prn id='Q1378578'>Eurytion</prn> the <prn id='Q83203'>Centaur</prn>. In course of time, it is said, the inhabitants, owing to their weakness, left <pl id='Q11939304'>Olenus</pl> and migrated to Peirae and Euryteiae. </p>
<p id='7.18.2'><b>7.18.2</b> About eighty stades from the river <pl id='Q3555219'>Peiros</pl> is the city of <pl id='Q133123'>Patrae</pl>. Not far from <pl id='Q133123'>Patrae</pl> the river <pl id='Q65233549'>Glaukos</pl> flows into the sea. The historians of ancient <pl id='Q133123'>Patrae</pl> say that it was an aboriginal, <prn id='Q12877440'>Eumelus</prn>, who first settled in the land, and that he was king over but a few subjects. But when <prn id='Q269243'>Triptolemus</prn> came from <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl>, he received from him cultivated corn, and, learning how to found a city, named it <prn id='Q12874112'>Aroe</prn> from the tilling of the soil. </p>
<p id='7.18.3'><b>7.18.3</b> It is said that <prn id='Q269243'>Triptolemus</prn> once fell asleep, and that then <prn id='Q16331048'>Antheias</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q12877440'>Eumelus</prn>, yoked the dragons to the car of <prn id='Q269243'>Triptolemus</prn> and tried to sow the seed himself. But <prn id='Q16331048'>Antheias</prn> fell off the car and was killed, and so <prn id='Q269243'>Triptolemus</prn> and <prn id='Q12877440'>Eumelus</prn> together founded a city, and called it <pl id='Q12872273'>Antheia</pl> after the son of <prn id='Q12877440'>Eumelus</prn>. </p>
<p id='7.18.4'><b>7.18.4</b> Between <pl id='Q12872273'>Antheia</pl> and <prn id='Q12874112'>Aroe</prn> was founded a third city, called <pl id='Q38280738'>Mesatis</pl>. The stories told of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> by the people of <pl id='Q133123'>Patrae</pl>, that he was reared in <pl id='Q38280738'>Mesatis</pl> and incurred there all sort of perils through the plots of the <prn id='Q45713'>Titans</prn>, I will not contradict, but will leave it to the people of <pl id='Q133123'>Patrae</pl> to explain the name <pl id='Q38280738'>Mesatis</pl> as they choose. </p>
<p id='7.18.5'><b>7.18.5</b> When afterwards the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> had driven out the <pl id='Q620874'>Ionians</pl>, <prn id='Q12883286'>Patreus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q3563956'>Preugenes</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q90776918'>Agenor</prn>, forbade the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> to settle in <pl id='Q12872273'>Antheia</pl> and <pl id='Q38280738'>Mesatis</pl>, but built at <prn id='Q12874112'>Aroe</prn> a wall of greater circumference so as to include <prn id='Q12874112'>Aroe</prn> within it, and named the city <pl id='Q133123'>Patrae</pl> after himself. <prn id='Q90776918'>Agenor</prn>, the father of <prn id='Q3563956'>Preugenes</prn>, was the son of <prn id='Q643575'>Areus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q16327560'>Ampyx</prn>, and <prn id='Q16327560'>Ampyx</prn> was a son of <prn id='Q106922722'>Pelias</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q106922918'>Aeginetes</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q106923031'>Dereites</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q5663136'>Harpalus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q482039'>Amyclas</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q1065774'>Lacedemon</prn>. </p>
<p id='7.18.6'><b>7.18.6</b> Such was the genealogy of <prn id='Q12883286'>Patreus</prn>. In course of time the people of <pl id='Q133123'>Patrae</pl> on their own account crossed into <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolia</pl>; they did this out of friendship for the <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolians</pl>, to help them in their war with the Gauls, and no other <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> joined them. But suffering unspeakable disasters in the fighting, and most of them being also crushed by poverty, all with the exception of a few left <pl id='Q133123'>Patrae</pl>, and scattered, owing to their love of agriculture, up and down the country, dwelling in, besides <pl id='Q133123'>Patrae</pl>, the following towns: <pl id='Q38280738'>Mesatis</pl>, <pl id='Q12872273'>Antheia</pl>, <pl id='Q16944934'>Bolina</pl>, <pl id='Q3561588'>Argyra</pl> and <pl id='Q4784583'>Arba</pl>. </p>
<p id='7.18.7'><b>7.18.7</b> But <prn id='Q1405'>Augustus</prn>, for some reason, perhaps because he thought that <pl id='Q133123'>Patrae</pl> was a convenient port of call, brought back again to <pl id='Q133123'>Patrae</pl> the men from the other towns, and united with them the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> also from <pl id='Q2148349'>Rhypes</pl>, which town he razed to the ground. He granted freedom to the <pl id='Q133123'>Patraeans</pl>, and to no other <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>; and he granted also all the other privileges that the Romans are accustomed to bestow on their colonists. </p>
<p id='7.18.8'><b>7.18.8</b> On the acropolis of <pl id='Q133123'>Patrae</pl> is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> <prn id='Q110800630'>Laphria</prn>. The surname of the goddess is a foreign one, and her image too was brought in from elsewhere. For after <pl id='Q750313'>Calydon</pl> with the rest of <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolia</pl> had been laid waste by the Emperor <prn id='Q1405'>Augustus</prn> in order that the <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolian</pl> people might be incorporated into <pl id='Q943637'>Nicopolis</pl> above <pl id='Q216551'>Actium</pl>, the people of <pl id='Q133123'>Patrae</pl> thus secured the image of <prn id='Q110800630'>Laphria</prn>. </p>
<p id='7.18.9'><b>7.18.9</b> Most of the images out of <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolia</pl> and from <pl id='Q416070'>Acarnania</pl> were brought by <prn id='Q1405'>Augustus</prn>' orders to <pl id='Q943637'>Nicopolis</pl>, but to <pl id='Q133123'>Patrae</pl> he gave, with other spoils from <pl id='Q750313'>Calydon</pl>, the image of <prn id='Q110800630'>Laphria</prn>, which even in my time was still worshipped on the acropolis of <pl id='Q133123'>Patrae</pl>. It is said that the goddess was surnamed <prn id='Q110800630'>Laphria</prn> after a man of <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl>, because the ancient image of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> was set up at <pl id='Q750313'>Calydon</pl> by Laphrius, the son of <prn id='Q56936702'>Castalius</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q2322448'>Delphus</prn>. </p>
<p id='7.18.10'><b>7.18.10</b> Others say that the wrath of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> against <prn id='Q749966'>Oeneus</prn> weighed as time went on more lightly (elaphroteron) on the <pl id='Q750313'>Calydonians</pl>, and they believe that this was why the goddess received her surname. The image represents her in the guise of a huntress; it is made of ivory and gold, and the artists were <prn id='Q451566'>Menaechmus</prn> and <prn id='Q21033521'>Soidas</prn> of <pl id='Q782278'>Naupactus</pl>, who, it is inferred, lived not much later than <prn id='Q1723440'>Canachus</prn> of <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl> and <prn id='Q1722514'>Callon</prn> of <pl id='Q191082'>Aegina</pl>. </p>
<p id='7.18.11'><b>7.18.11</b> Every year too the people of <pl id='Q133123'>Patrae</pl> celebrate the festival <prn id='Q2781184'>Laphria</prn> in honor of their <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, and at it they employ a method of sacrifice peculiar to the place. Round the altar in a circle they set up logs of wood still green, each of them sixteen cubits long. On the altar within the circle is placed the driest of their wood. Just before the time of the festival they construct a smooth ascent to the altar, piling earth upon the altar steps. </p>
<p id='7.18.12'><b>7.18.12</b> The festival begins with a most splendid procession in honor of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, and the maiden officiating as priestess rides last in the procession upon a car yoked to deer. It is, however, not till the next day that the sacrifice is offered, and the festival is not only a state function but also quite a popular general holiday. For the people throw alive upon the altar edible birds and every kind of victim as well; there are wild <prn id='Q58697'>boars</prn>, deer and gazelles; some bring <prn id='Q18498'>wolf</prn>-cubs or bear-cubs, others the full-grown beasts. They also place upon the altar fruit of cultivated trees. </p>
<p id='7.18.13'><b>7.18.13</b> Next they set fire to the wood. At this point I have seen some of the beasts, including a bear, forcing their way outside at the first rush of the flames, some of them actually escaping by their strength. But those who threw them in drag them back again to the pyre. It is not remembered that anybody has ever been wounded by the beasts. </p>
<p id='7.19.1'><b>7.19.1</b> Between the temple of <prn id='Q110800630'>Laphria</prn> and the altar stands the tomb of <prn id='Q1588440'>Eurypylus</prn>. Who he was and for what reason he came to this land I shall set forth presently; but I must first describe what the condition of affairs was at his arrival. The <pl id='Q620874'>Ionians</pl> who lived in <prn id='Q12874112'>Aroe</prn>, <pl id='Q12872273'>Antheia</pl> and <pl id='Q38280738'>Mesatis</pl> had in common a precinct and a temple of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> surnamed <prn id='Q106921266'>Triklaria</prn>, and in her honor the <pl id='Q620874'>Ionians</pl> used to celebrate every year a festival and an all-night vigil. The priesthood of the goddess was held by a maiden until the time came for her to be sent to a husband. </p>
<p id='7.19.2'><b>7.19.2</b> Now the story is that once upon a time it happened that the priestess of the goddess was <prn id='Q58461838'>Comaetho</prn>, a most beautiful maiden, who had a lover called <prn id='Q4289284'>Melanippus</prn>, who was far better and handsomer than his fellows. When <prn id='Q4289284'>Melanippus</prn> had won the love of the maiden, he asked the father for his daughter's hand. It is somehow a characteristic of old age to oppose the young in most things, and especially is it insensible to the desires of lovers. So <prn id='Q4289284'>Melanippus</prn> found it; although both he and <prn id='Q58461838'>Comaetho</prn> were eager to wed, he met with nothing but harshness from both his own parents and from those of his lover. </p>
<p id='7.19.3'><b>7.19.3</b> The history of <prn id='Q4289284'>Melanippus</prn>, like that of many others, proved that love is apt both to break the laws of men and to desecrate the worship of the gods, seeing that this pair had their fill of the passion of love in the sanctuary of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>. And hereafter also were they to use the sanctuary as a bridal-chamber. Forthwith the wrath of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> began to destroy the inhabitants; the earth yielded no harvest, and strange diseases occurred of an unusually fatal character. </p>
<p id='7.19.4'><b>7.19.4</b> When they appealed to the oracle at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> the <prn id='Q220344'>Pythian priestess</prn> accused <prn id='Q4289284'>Melanippus</prn> and <prn id='Q58461838'>Comaetho</prn>. The oracle ordered that they themselves should be sacrificed to <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, and that every year a sacrifice should be made to the goddess of the fairest youth and the fairest maiden. Because of this sacrifice the river flowing by the sanctuary of <prn id='Q106921266'>Triclaria</prn> was called <pl id='Q3566497'>Ameilichus</pl> (relentless). Previously the river had no name. </p>
<p id='7.19.5'><b>7.19.5</b> The innocent youths and maidens who perished because of <prn id='Q4289284'>Melanippus</prn> and <prn id='Q58461838'>Comaetho</prn> suffered a piteous fate, as did also their relatives; but the pair, I hold, were exempt from suffering, for the one thing that is worth a man's life is to be successful in love. </p>
<p id='7.19.6'><b>7.19.6</b> The sacrifice to <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> of human beings is said to have ceased in this way. An oracle had been given from <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> to the <pl id='Q133123'>Patraeans</pl> even before this, to the effect that a strange king would come to the land, bringing with him a strange daimon, and this king would put an end to the sacrifice to <prn id='Q106921266'>Triclaria</prn>. When <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl> was captured, and the Greeks divided the spoils, <prn id='Q1588440'>Eurypylus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q3735337'>Euaemon</prn> got a chest. In it was an image of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>, the work, so they say, of <prn id='Q44384'>Hephaestus</prn>, and given as a gift by <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> to <prn id='Q461212'>Dardanus</prn>. </p>
<p id='7.19.7'><b>7.19.7</b> But there are two other accounts of it. One is that this chest was left by <prn id='Q82732'>Aeneas</prn> when he fled; the other that it was thrown away by <prn id='Q170779'>Cassandra</prn> to be a curse to the Greek who found it. Be this as it may, <prn id='Q1588440'>Eurypylus</prn> opened the chest, saw the image, and forthwith on seeing it went mad. He continued to be insane for the greater part of the time, with rare lucid intervals. Being in this condition he did not proceed on his voyage to <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessaly</pl>, but made for the town and gulf of <pl id='Q56754242'>Cirrha</pl>. Going up to <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> he inquired of the oracle about his illness. </p>
<p id='7.19.8'><b>7.19.8</b> They say that the oracle given him was to the effect that where he should come across a people offering a strange sacrifice, there he was to set down the chest and make his home. Now the ships of <prn id='Q1588440'>Eurypylus</prn> were carried down by the wind to the sea off <prn id='Q12874112'>Aroe</prn>. On landing he came across a youth and a maiden who had been brought to the altar of <prn id='Q106921266'>Triclaria</prn>. So <prn id='Q1588440'>Eurypylus</prn> found it easy to understand about the sacrifice, while the people of the place remembered their oracle seeing a king whom they had never seen before, they also suspected that the chest had some god inside it. </p>
<p id='7.19.9'><b>7.19.9</b> And so the malady of <prn id='Q1588440'>Eurypylus</prn> and the sacrifice of these people came to an end, and the river was given its present name <pl id='Q3566497'>Meilichus</pl>. Certain writers have said that the events I have related happened not to the <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessalian</pl> <prn id='Q1378541'>Eurypylus</prn>, but to <prn id='Q1378541'>Eurypylus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q3706015'>Dexamenus</prn> who was king in <pl id='Q11939304'>Olenus</pl>, holding that this man joined <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> in his campaign against <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl> and received the chest from <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>. The rest of their story is the same as mine. </p>
<p id='7.19.10'><b>7.19.10</b> But I cannot bring myself to believe that <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> did not know the facts about the chest, if they were as described, nor, if he were aware of them, do I think that he would ever have given it to an ally as a gift. Further, the people of <pl id='Q133123'>Patrae</pl> have no tradition of a <prn id='Q1588440'>Eurypylus</prn> save the son of <prn id='Q3735337'>Euaemon</prn>, and to him every year they sacrifice as to a hero, when they celebrate the festival in honor of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>. </p>
<p id='7.20.1'><b>7.20.1</b> The surname of the god inside the chest is <prn id='Q5279412'>Aesymnetes</prn> (Dictator), and his chief attendants are nine men, elected by the people from all the citizens for their reputation, and women equal in number to the men. On one night of the festival the priest carries the chest outside. Now this is a privilege that this night has received, and there go down to the river <pl id='Q3566497'>Meilichus</pl> a certain number of the native children, wearing on their heads garlands of corn-ears. It was in this way that they used to array of old those whom they led to be sacrificed to <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>. </p>
<p id='7.20.2'><b>7.20.2</b> But at the present day they lay aside the garlands of corn-ears by the goddess, and after bathing in the river and putting on fresh garlands, this time made of ivy, they go to the sanctuary of <prn id='Q5279412'>Aesymnetes</prn>. This then is their established ritual, and within the precincts of <prn id='Q110800630'>Laphria</prn> is a temple of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> surnamed PanachaeaYY. The image is of ivory and gold. </p>
<p id='7.20.3'><b>7.20.3</b> On the way to the lower city there is a sanctuary of the <pl id='Q5278019'>Dindymenian</pl> Mother, and in it <prn id='Q262016'>Attis</prn> too is worshipped. Of him they have no image to show; that of the <prn id='Q334486'>Mother</prn> is of stone. In the agora is a temple of <prn id='Q106460486'>Olympian</prn> <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>; the god himself is on a throne with <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> standing by it. Beyond the <prn id='Q106460486'>Olympian</prn> is an image of <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> and a sanctuary of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>. The god is of bronze, and naked. On his feet are sandals, and one foot stands upon the skull of an <prn id='Q473194'>ox</prn>. </p>
<p id='7.20.4'><b>7.20.4</b> That <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> takes great pleasure in <prn id='Q473194'>oxen</prn> is shown by <prn id='Q212872'>Alcaeus</prn> in his hymn to <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn>, who writes how <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> stole <prn id='Q830'>cows</prn> of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, and even before <prn id='Q212872'>Alcaeus</prn> was born <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> made <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> tend <prn id='Q830'>cows</prn> of <prn id='Q332324'>Laomedon</prn> for a wage. In the <prn id='Q8275'>Iliad</prn> he puts these verses in the mouth of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>: </p>
<p id='7.20.5'><b>7.20.5</b> “Verily I built a wall for the <pl id='Q22647'>Trojans</pl> about their city, A wide wall and very beautiful, that the city might be impregnable; And thou, <prn id='Q3382132'>Phoebus</prn>, didst tend the shambling <prn id='Q830'>cows</prn> with crumpled horns.” This, it may be conjectured, is the reason for the <prn id='Q473194'>ox</prn> skull. In the agora, in the open, is an image of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> with the grave of <prn id='Q12883286'>Patreus</prn> in front of it. </p>
<p id='7.20.6'><b>7.20.6</b> Next to the agora is the <pl id='Q16327108'>Odeion</pl>, where has been dedicated an <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> well worth seeing. It was made from the spoils taken when alone of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> the people of <pl id='Q133123'>Patrae</pl> helped the <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolians</pl> against the army of the Gauls. The <pl id='Q16327108'>Odeion</pl> is in every way the finest in Greece, except, of course, the one at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>. This is unrivalled in size and magnificence, and was built by <prn id='Q311879'>Herodes</prn>, an <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl>, in memory of his dead wife. The reason why I omitted to mention this <pl id='Q1328165'>Odeion</pl> in my history of <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl> is that my account of the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> was finished before <prn id='Q311879'>Herodes</prn> began the building. </p>
<p id='7.20.7'><b>7.20.7</b> As you leave the agora of <pl id='Q133123'>Patrae</pl>, where the sanctuary of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> is, at this exit is a gate, upon which stand gilt statues, <prn id='Q12883286'>Patreus</prn>, <prn id='Q3563956'>Preugenes</prn>, and Atherion; the two latter are represented as boys, because <prn id='Q12883286'>Patreus</prn> is a boy in age. Opposite the agora by this exit is a precinct of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> and temple of <prn id='Q106516710'>Limnatis</prn>. </p>
<p id='7.20.8'><b>7.20.8</b> When the <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn> were now in possession of <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl> and <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>, it is said that <prn id='Q3563956'>Preugenes</prn>, in obedience to a dream, stole from <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> the statue of <prn id='Q106516710'>Limnatis</prn>, and that he had as partner in his exploit the most devoted of his slaves. The image from <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl> is usually kept at <prn id='Q60791981'>Mesoa</prn>, because it was to this place that it was originally brought by <prn id='Q3563956'>Preugenes</prn>. But when the festival is being held for <prn id='Q106516710'>Limnatis</prn>, one of the slaves of the goddess comes from <prn id='Q60791981'>Mesoa</prn> bringing the ancient <prn id='Q693222'>xoanon</prn> to the precinct in the city. </p>
<p id='7.20.9'><b>7.20.9</b> Near this precinct the people of <pl id='Q133123'>Patrae</pl> have other sanctuaries. These are not in the open, but there is an entrance to them through the porticoes. The image of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>, save for the drapery, is of stone; <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> is made of ivory and gold. Before the sanctuary of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> is the tomb of <prn id='Q3563956'>Preugenes</prn>. Every year they sacrifice to <prn id='Q3563956'>Preugenes</prn> as to a hero, and likewise to <prn id='Q12883286'>Patreus</prn> also, when the festival of <prn id='Q106516710'>Limnatis</prn> is being held. Not far from the theater is a temple of <prn id='Q185747'>Nemesis</prn>, and another of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>. The statues are colossal and of white marble. </p>
<p id='7.21.1'><b>7.21.1</b> In this part of the city is also a sanctuary of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> surnamed <pl id='Q750313'>Calydonian</pl>, for the image of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> too was brought from <pl id='Q750313'>Calydon</pl>. When <pl id='Q750313'>Calydon</pl> was still inhabited, among the <pl id='Q750313'>Calydonians</pl> who became priests of the god was <prn id='Q1784380'>Coresus</prn>, who more than any other man suffered cruel wrongs because of love. He was in love with <prn id='Q525524'>Callirhoe</prn>, a maiden. But the love of <prn id='Q1784380'>Coresus</prn> for <prn id='Q525524'>Callirhoe</prn> was equalled by the maiden's hatred of him. </p>
<p id='7.21.2'><b>7.21.2</b> When the maiden refused to change her mind, in spite of the many prayers and promises of <prn id='Q1784380'>Coresus</prn>, he then went as a suppliant to the image of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>. The god listened to the prayer of his priest, and the <pl id='Q750313'>Calydonians</pl> at once became raving as though through drink, and they were still out of their minds when death overtook them. So they appealed to the oracle at <pl id='Q382317'>Dodona</pl>. For the inhabitants of this part of the mainland, the <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolians</pl> and their <pl id='Q416070'>Acarnanian</pl> and EpeirotYY neighbors, considered that the truest oracles were the doves and the responses from the oak. </p>
<p id='7.21.3'><b>7.21.3</b> On this occasion the oracles from <pl id='Q382317'>Dodona</pl> declared that it was the wrath of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> that caused the plague, which would not cease until <prn id='Q1784380'>Coresus</prn> sacrificed to <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> either <prn id='Q525524'>Callirhoe</prn> herself or one who had the courage to die in her stead. When the maiden could find no means of escape, she next appealed to her foster parents. These too failing her, there was no other way except for her to be put to the sword. </p>
<p id='7.21.4'><b>7.21.4</b> When everything had been prepared for the sacrifice according to the oracle from <pl id='Q382317'>Dodona</pl>, the maiden was led like a victim to the altar. <prn id='Q1784380'>Coresus</prn> stood ready to sacrifice, when, his resentment giving way to love, he slew himself in place of <prn id='Q525524'>Callirhoe</prn>. He thus proved in deed that his love was more genuine than that of any other man we know. </p>
<p id='7.21.5'><b>7.21.5</b> When <prn id='Q525524'>Callirhoe</prn> saw <prn id='Q1784380'>Coresus</prn> lying dead, the maiden repented. Overcome by pity for <prn id='Q1784380'>Coresus</prn>, and by shame at her conduct towards him, she cut her throat at the spring in <pl id='Q750313'>Calydon</pl> not far from the harbor, and later generations call the spring <prn id='Q525524'>Callirhoe</prn> after her. </p>
<p id='7.21.6'><b>7.21.6</b> Near to the theater the <pl id='Q133123'>Patrans</pl> have made a precinct sacred to a native lady. Here are images of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>, equal in number to the ancient cities, and named after them Mesateus, A253 and Aroeus. These images at the festival of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> they bring into the sanctuary of <prn id='Q5279412'>Aesymnetes</prn> (Dictator). This sanctuary is on the right of the road from the agora to the sea-quarter of the city. </p>
<p id='7.21.7'><b>7.21.7</b> As you go lower down from <prn id='Q5279412'>Aesymnetes</prn> there is another sanctuary with an image of stone. It is called the sanctuary of <prn id='Q6132631'>Soteria</prn> (salvation), and the story is that it was originally founded by <prn id='Q1588440'>Eurypylus</prn> on being cured of his madness. At the harbor is a temple of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> with a standing image of stone. Besides the names given by poets to <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> to adorn their verses, and in addition to his local names, all men give him the following surnames — <prn id='Q111671952'>Pelagaios</prn> (marine), <prn id='Q55804838'>Asphalios</prn> (safety-giver), <prn id='Q20100719'>Hippios</prn> (horse). </p>
<p id='7.21.8'><b>7.21.8</b> Various reasons could be plausibly assigned for the last of these surnames having been given to the god, but my own conjecture is that he got this name as the inventor of horsemanship. <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>, at any rate, when describing the chariot-race, puts into the mouth of <prn id='Q171839'>Menelaus</prn> a challenge to swear an oath by this god: “Touch the <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn>, and swear by the <prn id='Q106517783'>Gaieochos</prn> (earth-holder), <prn id='Q60449380'>Ennosigaios</prn> (earth-shaker), That thou didst not intentionally, through guile, obstruct my chariot.” </p>
<p id='7.21.9'><b>7.21.9</b> <prn id='Q11939948'>Pamphos</prn> also, who composed for the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> the most ancient of their hymns, says that <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> is: “Giver of <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn> and of ships with sails set.” So it is from horsemanship that he has acquired his name, and not for any other reason. </p>
<p id='7.21.10'><b>7.21.10</b> In <pl id='Q133123'>Patrae</pl>, not far from that of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, are sanctuaries of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>. One of the two images was drawn up by fishermen in a net a generation before my time. There are also quite near to the harbor two images of bronze, one of <prn id='Q40901'>Ares</prn> and the other of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>. The image of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>, whose precinct too is by the harbor, has its face, hands and feet of stone, while the rest of the figure is made of wood. </p>
<p id='7.21.11'><b>7.21.11</b> They have also a grove by the sea, affording in summer weather very agreeable walks and a pleasant means generally of passing the time. In this grove are also two temples of divinities, one of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, the other of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>. The images of these too are made of stone. Next to the grove is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>; she and her daughter are standing, but the image of <prn id='Q93172'>Earth</prn> is seated. </p>
<p id='7.21.12'><b>7.21.12</b> Before the sanctuary of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> is a spring. On the side of this towards the temple stands a wall of stones, while on the outer side has been made a descent to the spring. Here there is an infallible oracle, not indeed for everything, but only in the case of sick folk. They tie a mirror to a fine cord and let it down, judging the distance so that it does not sink deep into the spring, but just far enough to touch the water with its rim. Then they pray to the goddess and burn incense, after which they look into the mirror, which shows them the patient either alive or dead. </p>
<p id='7.21.13'><b>7.21.13</b> This water partakes to this extent of truth, but close to <pl id='Q1762663'>Cyaneae</pl> by <pl id='Q18927'>Lycia</pl>, where there is an oracle of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> <prn id='Q111672117'>Thyrxeus</prn>, the water shows to him who looks into the spring all the things that he wants to behold. By the grove in <pl id='Q133123'>Patrae</pl> are also two sanctuaries of <prn id='Q214554'>Serapis</prn>. In one is the tomb of <prn id='Q404844'>Egyptus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q617753'>Belus</prn>. He is said by the people of <pl id='Q133123'>Patrae</pl> to have fled to <prn id='Q12874112'>Aroe</prn> because of the misfortunes of his children and because he shuddered at the mere name of <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>, and even more through dread of <prn id='Q210883'>Danaus</prn>. </p>
<p id='7.21.14'><b>7.21.14</b> There is also at <pl id='Q133123'>Patrae</pl> a sanctuary of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>. This sanctuary is beyond the acropolis near the gate leading to <pl id='Q38280738'>Mesatis</pl>. The women of <pl id='Q133123'>Patrae</pl> outnumber the men by two to one. These women are amongst the most charming in the world. Most of them gain a livelihood from the fine flax that grows in <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>, weaving from it nets for the head as well as dresses. </p>
<p id='7.22.1'><b>7.22.1</b> <pl id='Q3562963'>Pharae</pl>, a city of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, belongs to <pl id='Q133123'>Patrae</pl>, having been given to it by <prn id='Q1405'>Augustus</prn>. The road from the city of <pl id='Q133123'>Patrae</pl> to <pl id='Q3562963'>Pharae</pl> is a hundred and fifty stades, while <pl id='Q3562963'>Pharae</pl> is about seventy stades inland from the coast. Near to <pl id='Q3562963'>Pharae</pl> runs the river Pieros, which in my opinion is the same as the one flowing past the ruins of <pl id='Q11939304'>Olenus</pl>, called by the men of the coast the <pl id='Q3555219'>Peiros</pl>. Near the river is a grove of plane-trees, most of which are hollow through age, and so huge that they actually feast in the holes, and those who have a mind to do so sleep there as well. </p>
<p id='7.22.2'><b>7.22.2</b> The agora of <pl id='Q3562963'>Pharae</pl> is of wide extent after the ancient fashion, and in the middle of it is an image of <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn>, made of stone and bearded. Standing right on the earth, it is of square shape, and of no great size. On it is an inscription, saying that it was dedicated by SimylusYY the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl>. It is called <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> <prn id='Q21548139'>Agoraios</prn>, and by it is established an oracle. In front of the image is placed a hearth, which also is of stone, and to the hearth bronze lamps are fastened with lead. </p>
<p id='7.22.3'><b>7.22.3</b> Coming at eventide, the inquirer of the god, having burnt incense upon the hearth, filled the lamps with oil and lighted them, puts on the altar on the right of the image a local coin, called a “copper,” and asks in the ear of the god the particular question he wishes to put to him. After that he stops his ears and leaves the marketplace. On coming outside he takes his hands from his ears, and whatever utterance he hears he considers oracular. </p>
<p id='7.22.4'><b>7.22.4</b> There is a similar method of divination practised at the sanctuary of <prn id='Q208150'>Apis</prn> in <pl id='Q11768'>Egypt</pl>. At <pl id='Q3562963'>Pharae</pl> there is also a water sacred to <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn>. The name of the spring is <PRN id='Q41484'>Hermes' stream</PRN>, and the fish in it are not caught, being considered sacred to the god. Quite close to the image stand square stones, about thirty in number. These the people of <pl id='Q3562963'>Pharae</pl> adore, calling each by the name of some god. At a more remote period all the Greeks alike worshipped uncarved stones instead of images of the gods. </p>
<p id='7.22.5'><b>7.22.5</b> About fifteen stades from <pl id='Q3562963'>Pharae</pl> is a grove of the <prn id='Q190103'>Dioscuri</prn>. The trees in it are chiefly laurels; I saw in it neither temple nor images, the latter, according to the natives, having been carried away to <pl id='Q18287233'>Rome</pl>. In the grove at <pl id='Q3562963'>Pharae</pl> is an altar of unshaped stones. I could not discover whether the founder of <pl id='Q3562963'>Pharae</pl> was <prn id='Q1246244'>Phares</prn>, son of <prn id='Q18552931'>Phylodameia</prn>, daughter of <prn id='Q210883'>Danaus</prn>, or someone else with the same name. </p>
<p id='7.22.6'><b>7.22.6</b> <pl id='Q56760760'>Triteia</pl>, also a city of <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaia</pl>, is situated inland, but like <pl id='Q3562963'>Pharae</pl> belongs to <pl id='Q133123'>Patrae</pl>, having been annexed by the emperor. The distance to <pl id='Q56760760'>Triteia</pl> from <pl id='Q3562963'>Pharae</pl> is a hundred and twenty stades. Before you enter the city is a tomb of white marble, well worth seeing, especially for the paintings on the grave, the work of <prn id='Q2583871'>Nicias</prn>. There is an ivory chair on which is a young and beautiful woman, by whose side is a handmaid carrying a sunshade. There is also a young man, who is standing. </p>
<p id='7.22.7'><b>7.22.7</b> He is too young for a beard, and wears a tunic with a purple cloak over it. By his side is a servant carrying javelins and leading <prn id='Q726'>hounds</prn>. I could not discover their names, but anyone can conjecture that here man and wife share a common grave. </p>
<p id='7.22.8'><b>7.22.8</b> The founder of <pl id='Q56760760'>Triteia</pl> is said by some to have been <prn id='Q123334066'>Celbidas</prn>, who came from <pl id='Q243456'>Cumae</pl> in the country of the <prn id='Q3884171'>Opici</prn>. Others say that <prn id='Q40901'>Ares</prn> mated with <prn id='Q7844262'>Triteia</prn> the daughter of <prn id='Q148030'>Triton</prn>, that this maiden was priestess to <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, and that <prn id='Q26647461'>Melanippus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q40901'>Ares</prn> and <prn id='Q7844262'>Triteia</prn>, founded the city when he grew up, naming it after his mother. </p>
<p id='7.22.9'><b>7.22.9</b> In <pl id='Q56760760'>Triteia</pl> is a sanctuary of the gods called Megistoi (Greatest), and their images are made of clay. In honor of these every year they celebrate a festival, exactly the same sort of festival as the Greeks hold in honor of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>. There is also a temple of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, and the modern image is of stone. The ancient image, as the folk of <pl id='Q56760760'>Triteia</pl> say, was carried to <pl id='Q18287233'>Rome</pl>. The people here are accustomed to sacrifice both to <prn id='Q40901'>Ares</prn> and to <prn id='Q7844262'>Triteia</prn>. </p>
<p id='7.22.10'><b>7.22.10</b> These cities are at some distance from the sea and completely inland. As you sail to <pl id='Q60790078'>Aegium</pl> from <pl id='Q133123'>Patrae</pl> you come first to the cape called <pl id='Q24990480'>Rhium</pl>, fifty stades from <pl id='Q133123'>Patrae</pl>, the harbor of <pl id='Q12882440'>Panormus</pl> being fifteen stades farther from the cape. It is another fifteen stades from <pl id='Q12882440'>Panormus</pl> to what is known as the <pl id='Q111672487'>Teichos of Athena</pl> (fort of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>). From the <pl id='Q111672487'>Teichos of Athena</pl> to the harbor of <pl id='Q48781609'>Erineus</pl> is a coastal voyage of ninety stades, and from <pl id='Q48781609'>Erineus</pl> to <pl id='Q60790078'>Aegium</pl> is sixty. But the land route is about forty stades less than the number here given. </p>
<p id='7.22.11'><b>7.22.11</b> Not far from the city of <pl id='Q133123'>Patrae</pl> is the river <pl id='Q3566497'>Meilichus</pl>, and the sanctuary of <prn id='Q106921266'>Triclaria</prn>, which no longer has an image. This is on the right. Advancing from the <pl id='Q3566497'>Meilichus</pl> you come to another river, the name of which is the <pl id='Q3558316'>Charadrus</pl>. The flocks and herds that drink of this river in spring are bound to have male young ones for the most part, and for this reason the herdsmen remove all except the <prn id='Q830'>cows</prn> to another part of the country. The <prn id='Q830'>cows</prn> they leave behind by the river, because for sacrifices and for agriculture <prn id='Q693690'>bulls</prn> are more suitable than <prn id='Q830'>cows</prn>, but in the case of other <prn id='Q830'>cattle</prn> the females are preferred. </p>
<p id='7.23.1'><b>7.23.1</b> After the <pl id='Q3558316'>Charadrus</pl> you come to some ruins, not at all remarkable, of the city <pl id='Q3561588'>Argyra</pl>, to the spring <prn id='Q3560453'>Argyra</prn>, on the right of the high road, and to the river <pl id='Q3566505'>Selemnus</pl> going down to the sea. The local legend about <prn id='Q3566505'>Selemnus</prn> is that he was a handsome lad who used to feed his flocks here. <prn id='Q3560453'>Argyra</prn>, they say, was a sea-nymph, who fell in love with <prn id='Q3566505'>Selemnus</prn> and used to come up out of the sea to visit him, sleeping by his side. </p>
<p id='7.23.2'><b>7.23.2</b> After no long while <prn id='Q3566505'>Selemnus</prn> no longer seemed so handsome, and the nymph would not visit him. So <prn id='Q3566505'>Selemnus</prn>, deserted by <prn id='Q3560453'>Argyra</prn>, died of love, and <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> turned him into a river. This is what the people of <pl id='Q133123'>Patrae</pl> say. As <pl id='Q3566505'>Selemnus</pl> continued to love <prn id='Q3560453'>Argyra</prn> even when he was turned into water, just as <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl> in the legend continued to love <prn id='Q643456'>Arethusa</prn>, <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> bestowed on him a further gift, by blotting out the memory of <prn id='Q3560453'>Argyra</prn>. </p>
<p id='7.23.3'><b>7.23.3</b> I heard too another tale about the water, how that it is a useful remedy for both men and women when in love; if they wash in the river they forget their passion.

<p id='7.23.4'><b>7.23.4</b> At some distance from <pl id='Q3561588'>Argyra</pl> is a river named <pl id='Q3566513'>Bolinaeus</pl>, and by it once stood a city <pl id='Q16944934'>Bolina</pl>. <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, says a legend, fell in love with a maiden called <prn id='Q4939448'>Bolina</prn>, who fleeing to the sea here threw herself into it, and by the favour of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> became an immortal. Next to it a cape juts out into the sea, and of it is told a story how <prn id='Q44204'>Cronus</prn> threw into the sea here the sickle with which he mutilated his father <prn id='Q79999'>Uranus</prn>. For this reason they call the cape <pl id='Q25081519'>Drepanum</pl>. Beyond the high road are the ruins of <pl id='Q2148349'>Rhypes</pl>. <pl id='Q60790078'>Aegium</pl> is about thirty stades distant from <pl id='Q2148349'>Rhypes</pl>. </p>
<p id='7.23.5'><b>7.23.5</b> The territory of <pl id='Q60790078'>Aegium</pl> is crossed by a river <pl id='Q12885817'>Phoenix</pl>, and by another called <pl id='Q25018042'>Meiganitas</pl>, both of which flow into the sea. A stoa near the city was made for <prn id='Q108392251'>Straton</prn>, an athlete who won at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> on the same day victories in the pancratium and in wrestling. The stoa was built that this man might exercise himself in it. At <pl id='Q60790078'>Aegium</pl> is an ancient sanctuary of <prn id='Q94066'>Eileithyia</prn>, and her image is covered from head to foot with finely-woven drapery; it is of wood except the face, hands and feet, </p>
<p id='7.23.6'><b>7.23.6</b> which are made of <pl id='Q1125206'>Pentelic</pl> marble. One hand is stretched out straight; the other holds up a torch. One might conjecture that torches are an attribute of <prn id='Q94066'>Eileithyia</prn> because the pangs of women are just like fire. The torches might also be explained by the fact that it is <prn id='Q94066'>Eileithyia</prn> who brings children to the light. The image is a work of <prn id='Q1158742'>Damophon</prn> the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl>. </p>
<p id='7.23.7'><b>7.23.7</b> Not far from <prn id='Q94066'>Eileithyia</prn> is a precinct of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>, with images of him and of <prn id='Q202257'>Health</prn>. An iambic line on the pedestal says that the artist was <prn id='Q1158742'>Damophon</prn> the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl>. In this sanctuary of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> a man of <pl id='Q163490'>Sidon</pl> entered upon an argument with me. He declared that the <pl id='Q41642'>Phoenicians</pl> had better notions about the gods than the Greeks, giving as an instance that to <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> they assign <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> as father, but no mortal woman as his mother. </p>
<p id='7.23.8'><b>7.23.8</b> <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>, he went on, is air, bringing health to mankind and to all animals likewise; <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> is the sun, and most rightly is he named the father of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>, because the sun, by adapting his course to the seasons, imparts to the air its healthfulness. I replied that I accepted his statements, but that the argument was as much Greek as <pl id='Q41642'>Phoenician</pl> for at <pl id='Q59637009'>Titane</pl> in <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonia</pl> the same image is called both <prn id='Q202257'>Health</prn> and . . .43 thus clearly showing that it is the course of the sun that brings health to mankind. </p>

Near the theater they have a sanctuary of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> with an image of the god as a beardless youth. There is also in the agora a precinct of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> surnamed <prn id='Q2303797'>Saviour</prn>, with two images, both of bronze, on the left as you go in; the one without a beard seemed to me the more ancient. </p>
<p id='7.23.10'><b>7.23.10</b> In a building right in front of the entrance are images, of bronze like the others, representing <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> and <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>. They are called gods from <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>. The <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> say it is because they were made in <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>; the people of <pl id='Q60790078'>Aegium</pl> themselves say that the images were deposited by the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> with them on trust. </p>
<p id='7.23.11'><b>7.23.11</b> They say further that they were ordered to sacrifice each day to the images. But bethinking themselves of a trick they sacrificed a vast number of animals, but the victims they ate up at public feasts, so that they were not put to any expense. At last the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> asked for the images to be returned, whereupon the people of <pl id='Q60790078'>Aegium</pl> asked for the cost of the sacrifices. As the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> had not the means to pay, they left the images at <pl id='Q60790078'>Aegium</pl>. </p>
<p id='7.24.1'><b>7.24.1</b> By the agora at <pl id='Q60790078'>Aegium</pl> is a temple shared by <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> and <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> in common; and in the agora there is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, who is represented in the act of shooting an arrow, and also the grave of <prn id='Q1367860'>Talthybius</prn> the herald. There is also at <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> a barrow serving as a tomb to <prn id='Q1367860'>Talthybius</prn>, and both cities sacrifice to him as to a hero. </p>
<p id='7.24.2'><b>7.24.2</b> By the sea at <pl id='Q60790078'>Aegium</pl> is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>, and after it one of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>; there is also one of the <prn id='Q45967'>Kore</prn> (Maiden), daughter of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>, and one to <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q107260444'>Homagyrius</prn> (Assembler). Here are images of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> and of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>. The surname <prn id='Q107260444'>Homagyrius</prn> was given to <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> because in this place <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn> assembled the most eminent men in Greece, in order that they might consult together how to make war on the empire of <prn id='Q170473'>Priam</prn>. Among the claims of <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn> to renown is that he destroyed <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl> and the cities around her with the forces that followed him originally, without any later reinforcements. </p>
<p id='7.24.3'><b>7.24.3</b> Adjoining <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q107260444'>Homagyrius</prn> is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> <prn id='Q107260957'>Panachaea</prn>. The beach, on which the people of <pl id='Q60790078'>Aegium</pl> have the sanctuaries I have mentioned, affords a plentiful supply of water from a spring; it is pleasing both to the eye and to the taste. They have also a sanctuary of <prn id='Q6132631'>Soteria</prn> (salvation). Her image may be seen by none but the priests, and the following ritual is performed. They take cakes of the district from the goddess and throw them into the sea, saying that they send them to <pl id='Q3747483'>Arethusa</pl> at <pl id='Q4420718'>Syracuse</pl>. </p>

Priests are elected for them every year, and each of the two images remains at the house of the priest. In a more remote age there was chosen to be priest for <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> from the boys he who won the prize for beauty. When his beard began to grow the honor for beauty passed to another boy. Such were the customs. Even in my time the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaean</pl> assembly still meets at <pl id='Q60790078'>Aegium</pl>, just as the <prn id='Q182875'>Amphictyons</prn> do at <pl id='Q194450'>Thermopylae</pl> and at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>. </p>
<p id='7.24.5'><b>7.24.5</b> Going on further you come to the river <pl id='Q952173'>Selinus</pl>, and forty stades away from <pl id='Q60790078'>Aegium</pl> is a place on the sea called <pl id='Q1432654'>Helice</pl>. Here used to be situated a city <pl id='Q1432654'>Helice</pl>, where the <pl id='Q620874'>Ionians</pl> had a very holy sanctuary of <prn id='Q65049896'>Heliconian</prn> <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>. Their worship of <prn id='Q65049896'>Heliconian</prn> <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> has remained, even after their expulsion by the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> to <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, and subsequently from <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> to the coasts of <prn id='Q48'>Asia</prn>. At <pl id='Q169460'>Miletus</pl> too on the way to the spring BiblisYY there is before the city an altar of <prn id='Q65049896'>Heliconian</prn> <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, and in <pl id='Q17586'>Teos</pl> likewise the <pl id='Q215516'>Heliconian</pl> has a precinct and an altar, well worth seeing. </p>
<p id='7.24.6'><b>7.24.6</b> There are also passages in <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> referring to <pl id='Q1432654'>Helice</pl> and the <prn id='Q65049896'>Heliconian</prn> <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>. But later on the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> of the place removed some suppliants from the sanctuary and killed them. But the wrath of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> visited them without delay; an earthquake promptly struck their land and swallowed up, without leaving a trace for posterity to see, both the buildings and the very site on which the city stood. </p>
<p id='7.24.7'><b>7.24.7</b> Warnings, usually the same in all cases, are wont to be sent by the god before violent and far-reaching earthquakes. Either continuous storms of rain or else continuous droughts occur before earthquakes for an unusual length of time, and the weather is unseasonable. In winter it turns too hot, and in summer along with a tendency to haze the orb of the sun presents an unusual color, slightly inclining to red or else to black. </p>
<p id='7.24.8'><b>7.24.8</b> Springs of water generally dry up; blasts of wind sometimes swoop upon the land and overturn the trees; occasionally great flames dart across the sky; the shapes of stars too appear such as have never been witnessed before, producing consternation in those that witness them; furthermore there is a violent rumbling of winds beneath the earth — these and many other warnings is the god wont to send before violent earthquakes occur. </p>
<p id='7.24.9'><b>7.24.9</b> The shock itself is not of one fixed type, but the original inquirers into such matters and their pupils have been able to discover the following forms of earthquake. The mildest form — that is, if such a calamity admits of mitigation — is when there coincides with the original shock, which levels the buildings with the ground, a shock in the opposite direction, counteracting the first and raising up the buildings already knocked over. </p>
<p id='7.24.10'><b>7.24.10</b> In this form of' earthquake pillars may be seen righting themselves which have been almost entirely uprooted, split walls coming together to their original position; beams, dislocated by the shock, go back to their places, and likewise channels, and such-like means of furthering the flow of water, have their cracks cemented better than they could be by human craftsmen. Now the second form of earthquake brings destruction to anything liable to it, and it throws over at once, as it were by a battering-ram, whatever meets the force of its impact. </p>
<p id='7.24.11'><b>7.24.11</b> The most destructive kind of earthquake the experts are wont to liken to the symptoms of a man suffering from a non-intermittent fever, the breathing of such a patient being rapid and laboured. There are symptoms of this to be found in many parts of the body, especially at each wrist. In the same way, they say, the earthquake dives directly under buildings and shakes up their foundations, just as molehills come up from the bowels of the earth. It is this sort of shock alone that leaves no trace on the ground that men ever dwelt there. </p>
<p id='7.24.12'><b>7.24.12</b> This was the type of earthquake, they say, that on the occasion referred to levelled <pl id='Q1432654'>Helice</pl> to the ground, and that it was accompanied by another disaster in the season of winter. The sea flooded a great part of the land, and covered up the whole of <pl id='Q1432654'>Helice</pl> all round. Moreover, the tide was so deep in the grove of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> that only the tops of the trees remained visible. What with the sudden earthquake, and the invasion of the sea that accompanied it, the tidal wave swallowed up <pl id='Q1432654'>Helice</pl> and every man in it. </p>
<p id='7.24.13'><b>7.24.13</b> A similar fate, though different in type, came upon a city on Mount <pl id='Q532698'>Sipylus</pl>, so that it vanished into a chasm. The mountain split, water welled up from the fissure, and the chasm became a lake called Saloe. The ruins of the city were to be seen in the lake, until the water of the torrent hid them from view. The ruins of <pl id='Q1432654'>Helice</pl> too are visible, but not so plainly now as they were once, because they are corroded by the salt water. </p>
<p id='7.25.1'><b>7.25.1</b> The disaster that befell <pl id='Q1432654'>Helice</pl> is but one of the many proofs that the wrath of <prn id='Q106522431'>Ikesios</prn> (Zeus of suppliants) is inexorable. The god at <pl id='Q382317'>Dodona</pl> too manifestly advises us to respect suppliants. For about the time of <prn id='Q3606201'>Apheidas</prn> the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> received from <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> of <pl id='Q382317'>Dodona</pl> the following verses: <br>“Consider the <pl id='Q202487'>Areopagus</pl>, and the smoking <pl id='Q116332640'>altars</pl> <br>Of the <prn id='Q180262'>Eumenides</prn>, where the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> are to be thy suppliants, <br>When hard-pressed in war. Kill them not with the sword, <br>And wrong not suppliants. For suppliants are sacred and holy. </p>
<p id='7.25.2'><b>7.25.2</b> The Greeks were reminded of these words when <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesians</pl> arrived at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> at the time when the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> king was <prn id='Q1052888'>Codrus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q1255043'>Melanthus</prn>. Now the rest of the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesian</pl> army, on learning of the death of <prn id='Q1052888'>Codrus</prn> and of the manner of it, departed from <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl>, the oracle from <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> making them despair of success in the future; but certain <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, who got unnoticed within the walls in the night, perceived at daybreak that their friends had gone, and when the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> gathered against them, they took refuge in the <pl id='Q202487'>Areopagus</pl> at the <pl id='Q116332640'>altars</pl> of the goddesses called <prn id='Q180262'>Semnai</prn> (August). </p>
<p id='7.25.3'><b>7.25.3</b> On this occasion the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> allowed the suppliants to go away unharmed, but subsequently the magistrates themselves put to death the suppliants of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, when <prn id='Q433466'>Cylon</prn> and his supporters had seized the <pl id='Q131013'>Acropolis</pl>. So the slayers themselves and also their descendants were regarded as accursed to the goddess. The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> too put to death men who had taken refuge in the sanctuary of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> at <pl id='Q33119266'>Taenarum</pl>. Presently their city was shaken by an earthquake so continuous and violent that no house in <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl> could resist it. </p>
<p id='7.25.4'><b>7.25.4</b> The destruction of <pl id='Q1432654'>Helice</pl> occurred while <prn id='Q89088905'>Asteius</prn> was still archon at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, in the fourth year of the <prn id='Q57337792'>hundred and first Olympiad</prn> [373 BCE], whereat <prn id='Q17115203'>Damon</prn> of <pl id='Q602564'>Thurii</pl> was victorious for the first time. As none of the people of <pl id='Q1432654'>Helice</pl> were left alive, the land is occupied by the people of <pl id='Q60790078'>Aegium</pl>. </p>
<p id='7.25.5'><b>7.25.5</b> After <pl id='Q1432654'>Helice</pl> you will turn from the sea to the right and you will come to the town of <pl id='Q12879058'>Ceryneia</pl>. It is built on a mountain above the high road, and its name was given to it either by a native potentate or by the river <pl id='Q56402251'>Cerynites</pl>, which, flowing from <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl> and Mount <pl id='Q12879058'>Ceryneia</pl>, passes through this part of <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaia</pl>. To this part came as settlers <pl id='Q132564'>Mycenaeans</pl> from <pl id='Q12649101'>Argolis</pl> because of a catastrophe. Though the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> could not take the wall of <pl id='Q132564'>Mycenae</pl> by storm, </p>
<p id='7.25.6'><b>7.25.6</b> built as it was like the wall of <pl id='Q217379'>Tiryns</pl> by the <prn id='Q128430'>Cyclopes</prn>, as they are called, yet the <pl id='Q132564'>Mycenaeans</pl> were forced to leave their city through lack of provisions. Some of them departed for <pl id='Q1774167'>Cleonae</pl>, but more than half of the population took refuge with <prn id='Q297086'>Alexander</prn> in <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl>, to whom <prn id='Q155063'>Mardonius</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q454695'>Gobryas</prn>, entrusted the message to be given to the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>. The rest of the population came to <pl id='Q12879058'>Ceryneia</pl>, and the addition of the <pl id='Q132564'>Mycenaeans</pl> made <pl id='Q12879058'>Ceryneia</pl> more powerful, through the increase of the population, and more renowned for the future. </p>
<p id='7.25.7'><b>7.25.7</b> In <pl id='Q12879058'>Ceryneia</pl> is a sanctuary of the <prn id='Q180262'>Eumenides</prn>, which they say was established by <prn id='Q192407'>Orestes</prn>. Whosoever enters with the desire to see the sights, if he be guilty of bloodshed, defilement or impiety, is said at once to become insane with fright, and for this reason the right to enter is not given to all and sundry. The images made of wood . . . they are not very large in size, and at the entrance to the sanctuary are statues of women, made of stone and of artistic workmanship. The natives said that the women are portraits of the former priestesses of the <prn id='Q180262'>Eumenides</prn>. </p>
<p id='7.25.8'><b>7.25.8</b> On returning from <pl id='Q12879058'>Ceryneia</pl> to the high road, if you go along it for a short distance you may turn aside again to <pl id='Q3555318'>Bura</pl>, which is situated on a mountain to the right of the sea. It is said that the name was given to the city from a woman called <prn id='Q4998063'>Bura</prn>, who was the daughter of <prn id='Q853462'>Ion</prn>, son of <prn id='Q514746'>Xuthus</prn>, and of <pl id='Q1432654'>Helice</pl>. When the god wiped off <pl id='Q1432654'>Helice</pl> from the face of the earth, <pl id='Q3555318'>Bura</pl> too suffered a severe earthquake, so that not even the ancient images were left in the sanctuaries. </p>
<p id='7.25.9'><b>7.25.9</b> The only <pl id='Q3555318'>Burians</pl> to survive were those who chanced to be absent at the time, either on active service or for some other reason, and these became the second founders of <pl id='Q3555318'>Bura</pl>. There is a temple here of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>, one of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> and <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>, and a third of <prn id='Q94066'>Eileithyia</prn>.

<p id='7.25.10'><b>7.25.10</b> On descending from <pl id='Q3555318'>Bura</pl> towards the sea you come to a river called <pl id='Q1871901'>Buraicus</pl>, and to a small <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> in a cave. He too is surnamed <prn id='Q56055038'>Buraicus</prn>, and here one can divine by means of a tablet and dice. He who inquires of the god offers up a prayer in front of the image, and after the prayer he takes four dice, a plentiful supply of which are placed by <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, and throws them upon the table. For every figure made by the dice there is an explanation expressly written on the tablet. </p>
<p id='7.25.11'><b>7.25.11</b> The straight road from <pl id='Q1432654'>Helice</pl> to the <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> is about thirty stades. Going on from the <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> you come to the mouth of a river that descends from a mountain in <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl> and never dries up. The river itself is called the <pl id='Q6436394'>Crathis</pl>, which is also the name of the <pl id='Q101048087'>mountain</pl> where the river has its source.

This <pl id='Q16737279'>Aegae</pl> is mentioned by <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> in <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn>'s speech: “They bring thee gifts up to <pl id='Q1432654'>Helice</pl> and to <pl id='Q16737279'>Aegae</pl>.” Hence it is plain that <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> was equally honored at <pl id='Q1432654'>Helice</pl> and at <pl id='Q16737279'>Aegae</pl>. </p>
<p id='7.25.13'><b>7.25.13</b> At no great distance from the <pl id='Q6436394'>Crathis</pl> you will find a tomb on the right of the road, and on the tombstone a man standing by the side of a <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn>; the colors of the painting have faded. From the grave it is a journey of about thirty stades to what is called the <pl id='Q102064585'>Gaeum</pl>, a sanctuary of <prn id='Q93172'>Earth</prn> surnamed <prn id='Q61050354'>Eurysternon</prn> (Broad-bosomed), whose <prn id='Q693222'>xoanon</prn> is one of the very oldest. The woman who from time to time is priestess henceforth remains chaste, and before her election must not have had intercourse with more than one man. The test applied is drinking <prn id='Q693690'>bull</prn>'s blood. Any woman who may chance not to speak the truth is immediately punished as a result of this test. If several women compete for the priesthood, lots are cast for the honor. </p>
<p id='7.26.1'><b>7.26.1</b> To the port of <pl id='Q18363976'>Aegeira</pl>, which has the same name as the city, it is seventy-two stades from the <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> that stands on the road to <pl id='Q3555318'>Bura</pl>. The coast town of <pl id='Q18363976'>Aegeira</pl> presents nothing worth recording; from the port to the upper city is twelve stades. </p>
<p id='7.26.2'><b>7.26.2</b> <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> in his poem calls the city <pl id='Q3563508'>Hyperesia</pl>. Its present name was given it while the <pl id='Q620874'>Ionians</pl> were still dwelling there, and the reason for the name was as follows. A hostile army of <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl> was about to invade their territory. As they thought themselves no match for the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl>, they collected all the <prn id='Q2934'>goats</prn> they had in the country, and gathering them together they tied torches to their horns, and when the night was far advanced they set the torches alight. </p>
<p id='7.26.3'><b>7.26.3</b> The <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl>, suspecting that allies were coming to the help of the <pl id='Q3563508'>Hyperesians</pl>, and that the flames came from their fires, set off home again. The <pl id='Q3563508'>Hyperesians</pl> gave their city its present name of <pl id='Q18363976'>Aegeira</pl> from the <prn id='Q2934'>goats</prn> (aiges), and where the most beautiful <prn id='Q2934'>goat</prn>, which led the others, crouched, they built a sanctuary of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> <prn id='Q1458788'>Agrotera</prn>, believing that the trick against the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl> was an inspiration of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>. </p>
<p id='7.26.4'><b>7.26.4</b> The name <pl id='Q18363976'>Aegeira</pl>, however, did not supersede <pl id='Q3563508'>Hyperesia</pl> at once, just as even in my time there were still some who called <pl id='Q1855809'>Oreus</pl> in <pl id='Q173096'>Euboea</pl> by its ancient name of <pl id='Q107586662'>Hestiaea</pl>. The sights of <pl id='Q18363976'>Aegeira</pl> worth recording include a sanctuary of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> with a sitting image of <pl id='Q1125206'>Pentelic</pl> marble, the work of <prn id='Q19999409'>Eucleides</prn> the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl>. In this sanctuary there also stands an image of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>. The face, hands and feet are of ivory, the rest is of wood, with ornamentation of gilt work and of colors. </p>
<p id='7.26.5'><b>7.26.5</b> There is also a temple of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, with an image of the modern style of workmanship. The priestess is a maiden, who holds office until she reaches the age to marry. There stands here too an ancient image, which the folk of <pl id='Q18363976'>Aegeira</pl> say is <prn id='Q192673'>Iphigeneia</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn>. If they are correct, it is plain that the temple must have been built originally for <prn id='Q192673'>Iphigeneia</prn>. </p>
<p id='7.26.6'><b>7.26.6</b> There is also a sanctuary of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>; the sanctuary itself, with the sculptures on the pediments, are very old; the wooden image of the god also is old, the figure being nude and of colossal size. None of the inhabitants could give the name of the artist, but anyone who has already seen the <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> at <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl> would be led to conjecture that the <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> in <pl id='Q18363976'>Aegeira</pl> was also a work of the same artist, <prn id='Q20100871'>Laphaes</prn> the <pl id='Q1412043'>Phliasian</pl>. </p>
<p id='7.26.7'><b>7.26.7</b> There are in a temple standing images of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>, and elsewhere images of <prn id='Q214554'>Serapis</prn> and of <prn id='Q79876'>Isis</prn>, these too being of <pl id='Q1125206'>Pentelic</pl> marble. They worship most devoutly the <prn id='Q423622'>Heavenly Goddess</prn>, but human beings must not enter her sanctuary. But into the sanctuary of the goddess they surname <prn id='Q221735'>Syrian</prn> they enter on stated days, but they must submit beforehand to certain customary purifications, especially in the matter of diet. </p>
<p id='7.26.8'><b>7.26.8</b> I remember observing at <pl id='Q18363976'>Aegeira</pl> a building in which was an image of <prn id='Q213440'>Fortune</prn> carrying the horn of <prn id='Q107785'>Amaltheia</prn>. By her side is a winged <prn id='Q121973'>Eros</prn>, the moral of which is that even success in love depends for mankind on fortune rather than on beauty. Now I am in general agreement with <prn id='Q134929'>Pindar</prn>'s ode, and especially with his making <prn id='Q213440'>Fortune</prn> one of the <prn id='Q180287'>Fates</prn>, and more powerful than her sisters. </p>
<p id='7.26.9'><b>7.26.9</b> In this building at <pl id='Q18363976'>Aegeira</pl> is also an old man in the attitude of a mourner, three women taking off their bracelets, and likewise three lads, with a man wearing a breastplate. They say that in a war of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> this last man fought more bravely than any other soldier of <pl id='Q18363976'>Aegeira</pl>, but was killed. His surviving brothers carried home the news of his death, and therefore in mourning for him his sisters are discarding their ornaments, and the natives call the father Sympathes, because even in the statue he is a piteous figure. </p>
<p id='7.26.10'><b>7.26.10</b> There is a straight road from the sanctuary of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> at <pl id='Q18363976'>Aegeira</pl>, passing through the mountains and steep. It is forty stades long, and leads to <pl id='Q16473204'>Phelloe</pl>, an obscure town, which was not always inhabited even when the <prn id='Q465331'>Ionians</prn> still occupied the land. The district round <pl id='Q16473204'>Phelloe</pl> is well suited for the growth of the vine; the rocky parts are covered with oaks, the home of deer and wild <prn id='Q58697'>boars</prn>. </p>
<p id='7.26.11'><b>7.26.11</b> You may reckon <pl id='Q16473204'>Phelloe</pl> one of the towns in Greece best supplied with flowing water. There are sanctuaries of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> and of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>. The goddess is of bronze, and is taking an arrow from her quiver. The image of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> is painted with vermilion. On going down from <pl id='Q18363976'>Aegeira</pl> to the port, and walking on again, we see on the right of the road the sanctuary of <prn id='Q1458788'>Agrotera</prn>, where they say the <prn id='Q2934'>goat</prn> crouched. </p>
<p id='7.26.12'><b>7.26.12</b> The territory of <pl id='Q18363976'>Aegeira</pl> is bounded by that of <pl id='Q2068130'>Pellene</pl>, which is the last city of <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaia</pl> in the direction of <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl> and the <pl id='Q12649101'>Argolid</pl>. The city got its name, according to the account of the <pl id='Q2068130'>Pellenians</pl>, from <prn id='Q457294'>Pallas</prn>, who was, they say, one of the <prn id='Q45713'>Titans</prn>, but the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> think it was from <prn id='Q6070954'>Pellen</prn>, an <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl>. And they say that he was the son of <prn id='Q30097019'>Phorbas</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q2632716'>Triopas</prn>. </p>
<p id='7.26.13'><b>7.26.13</b> Between <pl id='Q18363976'>Aegeira</pl> and <pl id='Q2068130'>Pellene</pl> once stood a town, subject to the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl> and called Donussa, which was laid waste by the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl>; it is mentioned, they say, in a verse of <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> that occurs in the list of those who accompanied <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn>: “And the men of <pl id='Q3563508'>Hyperesia</pl> and those of steep Donoessa.” They go on to say that when <prn id='Q242172'>Peisistratus</prn> collected the poems of <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>, which were scattered and handed down by tradition, some in one place and some in another, then either he or one of his colleagues perverted the name through ignorance. </p>
<p id='7.26.14'><b>7.26.14</b> The port of <pl id='Q2068130'>Pellene</pl> is <pl id='Q16326973'>Aristonautae</pl>. Its distance from <pl id='Q18363976'>Aegeira</pl> on the sea is one hundred and twenty stades, and to <pl id='Q2068130'>Pellene</pl> from this port is half that distance. They say that the name of <pl id='Q16326973'>Aristonautae</pl> was given to that port because it was one of the harbors into which the <prn id='Q165510'>Argonauts</prn> entered. </p>
<p id='7.27.1'><b>7.27.1</b> The city of <pl id='Q2068130'>Pellene</pl> is on a hill which rises to a sharp peak at its summit. This part then is precipitous, and therefore uninhabited, but on the lower slopes they have built their city, which is not continuous, but divided into two parts by the peak that rises up between. As you go to <pl id='Q2068130'>Pellene</pl> there is, by the roadside, an image of <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn>, who, in spite of his surname of <prn id='Q117837153'>Dolios</prn> (Crafty), is ready to fulfill the prayers of men. He is of square shape and bearded, and on his head is carved a cap. </p>
<p id='7.27.2'><b>7.27.2</b> On the way to the city, close up to it, is a temple of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, built of local stone, but the image is of ivory and gold. They say that <prn id='Q177302'>Pheidias</prn> made it before he made the images of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> on the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> <pl id='Q131013'>Acropolis</pl> and at <pl id='Q742538'>Plataea</pl>. The people of <pl id='Q2068130'>Pellene</pl> also say that a shrine of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> sinks deep into the ground, that this shrine is under the pedestal of the image, and that the air from the shrine is damp, and consequently good for the ivory. </p>
<p id='7.27.3'><b>7.27.3</b> Above the temple of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> is a grove, surrounded by a wall, of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> surnamed <prn id='Q2303797'>Saviour</prn>, by whom they swear their most solemn oaths. No man may enter the grove except the priests. These priests are natives, chosen chiefly because of their high birth. Opposite the grove of the <prn id='Q2303797'>Saviour</prn> is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> surnamed <prn id='Q21051047'>Lampter</prn> (Torch). In his honor they celebrate a festival called the Feast of Torches, when they bring by night firebrands into the sanctuary, and set up bowls of wine throughout the whole city. </p>
<p id='7.27.4'><b>7.27.4</b> There is also at <pl id='Q2068130'>Pellene</pl> a sanctuary of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> <prn id='Q107092872'>Theoxenius</prn> (god of strangers), and the image is made of bronze. They hold in honor of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> games that they call <prn id='Q12877855'>Theoxenia</prn>, with money as the prizes of victory, the competitors being the natives. Near the sanctuary of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> is a temple of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, the goddess being represented in the attitude of shooting. In the agora is built a tank, and for bathing they use rain-water, since for drinking there are a few springs beneath the city. The place where the springs are they name Glyceiae (Sweet Springs). </p>
<p id='7.27.5'><b>7.27.5</b> There is an old gymnasium chiefly given up to the exercises of the youths. No one may be enrolled on the register of citizens before he has been on the register of youths. Here stands a man of <pl id='Q2068130'>Pellene</pl> called <prn id='Q7249671'>Promachus</prn>, the son of Dryon, who won prizes in the pancratium, one at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>, three at the <pl id='Q16600469'>Isthmus</pl> and two at <pl id='Q748108'>Nemea</pl>. The <pl id='Q2068130'>Pellenians</pl> made two statues of him, dedicating one at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> and one in the gymnasium; the latter is of stone, not bronze. </p>
<p id='7.27.6'><b>7.27.6</b> It is said too that when a war arose between <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl> and <pl id='Q2068130'>Pellene</pl>, <prn id='Q7249671'>Promachus</prn> killed a vast number of the enemy. It is said that he also overcame at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> <prn id='Q3141687'>Polydamas</prn> of <pl id='Q8777773'>Scotussa</pl>, this being the occasion when, after his safe return home from the king of <pl id='Q3746183'>Persia</pl>, he came for the second time to compete in the <prn id='Q188468'>Olympic games</prn>. The <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessalians</pl>, however, refuse to admit that <prn id='Q3141687'>Polydamas</prn> was beaten; one of the pieces of evidence they bring forward is a verse about <prn id='Q3141687'>Polydamas</prn>: — “Scotoessa, nurse of unbeaten <prn id='Q3141687'>Polydamas</prn>.” </p>
<p id='7.27.7'><b>7.27.7</b> Be this as it may, the people of <pl id='Q2068130'>Pellene</pl> hold <prn id='Q7249671'>Promachus</prn> in the highest honor. But <prn id='Q428222'>Chaeron</prn>, who carried off two prizes for wrestling at the <prn id='Q675181'>Isthmian games</prn> and four at the <pl id='Q38888'>Olympian</pl>, they will not even mention by name. This I believe is because he overthrew the constitution of <pl id='Q2068130'>Pellene</pl>, and received from <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn>, the most invidious of all gifts, to be set up as tyrant of one's own fatherland. </p>
<p id='7.27.8'><b>7.27.8</b> <pl id='Q2068130'>Pellene</pl> has also a sanctuary of <prn id='Q94066'>Eileithyia</prn>, which is situated in the lesser portion of the city. What is called the Poseidium in more ancient days was a township, but today it is uninhabited. This Poseidium is below the gymnasium, and down to the present day it has been considered sacred to <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>. </p>
<p id='7.27.9'><b>7.27.9</b> About sixty stades distant from <pl id='Q2068130'>Pellene</pl> is the MysaeumYY, a sanctuary of the <prn id='Q107305000'>Mysian</prn> <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>. It is said that it was founded by MysiusYY, a man of <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>, who according to <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl> tradition gave <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> a welcome in his home. There is a grove in the MysaeumYY, containing trees of every kind, and in it rises a copious supply of water from springs. Here they also celebrate a seven days' festival in honor of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>. </p>
<p id='7.27.10'><b>7.27.10</b> On the third day of the festival the men withdraw from the sanctuary, and the women are left to perform on that night the ritual that custom demands. Not only men are excluded, but even male <prn id='Q144'>dogs</prn>. On the following day the men come to the sanctuary, and the men and the women laugh and jeer at one another in turn. </p>
<p id='7.27.11'><b>7.27.11</b> At no great distance from the MysaeumYY is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>, called <prn id='Q8423'>Cyrus</prn>, where cures of patients are effected by the god. Here too there is a copious supply of water, and at the largest of the springs stands the image of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>. Rivers come down from the mountains above <pl id='Q2068130'>Pellene</pl>, the one on the side nearest <pl id='Q18363976'>Aegeira</pl> being called <pl id='Q5465042'>Crius</pl>, after, it is said, a <prn id='Q45713'>Titan</prn> of the same name. </p>
<p id='7.27.12'><b>7.27.12</b> There is another river called <prn id='Q192136'>Crius</prn>, which rises in Mount <pl id='Q532698'>Sipylus</pl> and is a tributary of the <pl id='Q1351474'>Hermus</pl>. Where the territory of <pl id='Q2068130'>Pellene</pl> borders on that of <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl> is a <pl id='Q2068130'>Pellenian</pl> river <pl id='Q94578661'>Sythas</pl>, the last of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaean</pl> rivers, which flows into the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonian</pl> sea. </p>

The first people within the peninsula are the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthians</pl>, living on the <pl id='Q16600469'>Isthmus</pl>, and their neighbors on the side sea-wards are the <pl id='Q233576'>Epidaurians</pl>. Along <pl id='Q233576'>Epidaurus</pl>, <pl id='Q581494'>Troezen</pl>, and <pl id='Q58401924'>Hermion</pl>, come the <pl id='Q648317'>Argolic</pl> Gulf and the coast of <pl id='Q12649101'>Argolis</pl>; next to <pl id='Q12649101'>Argolis</pl> come the vassals of <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl>, and these border on <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl>, which comes down to the sea at <pl id='Q60790706'>Mothone</pl>, <pl id='Q2047396'>Pylus</pl> and <pl id='Q1026705'>Cyparissiae</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.1.2'><b>8.1.2</b> On the side of <pl id='Q1811299'>Lechaeum</pl> the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthians</pl> are bounded by the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl>, who dwell in the extreme part of <pl id='Q12649101'>Argolis</pl> on this side. After <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl> come the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> who live along the coast at the other end of the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl>, opposite the <pl id='Q767387'>Echinadian</pl> islands, dwell the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>.

<p id='8.1.3'><b>8.1.3</b> These that I have mentioned extend to the sea, but the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> are shut off from the sea on every side and dwell in the interior. Hence, when they went to <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl>, so <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> says, they did not sail in their own ships, but in vessels lent by <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.1.4'><b>8.1.4</b> The <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> say that <prn id='Q1636827'>Pelasgus</prn> was the first inhabitant of this land. It is natural to suppose that others accompanied <prn id='Q1636827'>Pelasgus</prn>, and that he was not by himself; for otherwise he would have been a king without any subjects to rule over. However, in stature and in prowess, in beauty and in wisdom, <prn id='Q1636827'>Pelasgus</prn> excelled his fellows, and for this reason, I think, he was chosen to be king by them. <prn id='Q730625'>Asius</prn> the poet says of him: <br>“The godlike <prn id='Q1636827'>Pelasgus</prn> on the wooded mountains <br>Black earth gave up, that the race of mortals might exist.” </p>
<p id='8.1.5'><b>8.1.5</b> <prn id='Q1636827'>Pelasgus</prn> on becoming king invented huts that humans should not shiver, or be soaked by rain, or oppressed by heat. Moreover; he it was who first thought of coats of <prn id='Q7368'>sheep</prn>-skins, such as poor folk still wear in <pl id='Q173096'>Euboea</pl> and <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl>. He too it was who checked the habit of eating green leaves, grasses, and roots always inedible and sometimes poisonous. </p>
<p id='8.1.6'><b>8.1.6</b> But he introduced as food the nuts of trees, not those of all trees but only the acorns of the edible oak. Some people have followed this diet so closely since the time of <prn id='Q1636827'>Pelasgus</prn> that even the <prn id='Q220344'>Pythian priestess</prn>, when she forbade the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> to touch the land of the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl>, uttered the following verses: <br>“In <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl> are many men who eat acorns, <br>Who will prevent you; though I do not grudge it you.” <br>It is said that it was in the reign of <prn id='Q1636827'>Pelasgus</prn> that the land was called PelasgiaYY. </p>
<p id='8.2.1'><b>8.2.1</b> <prn id='Q501667'>Lycaon</prn> the son of <prn id='Q1636827'>Pelasgus</prn> devised the following plans, which were more clever than those of his father. He founded the city <pl id='Q1878714'>Lycosura</pl> on <pl id='Q1878690'>Mount Lykaion</pl>, gave to <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> the surname <prn id='Q106301499'>Lycaeus</prn> and founded the <prn id='Q614734'>Lycaean</prn> games. I hold that the <prn id='Q1162701'>Panathenian</prn> festival was not founded before the <prn id='Q614734'>Lycaean</prn>. The early name for the former festival was the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl>, which was changed to the <prn id='Q1162701'>Panathenian</prn> in the time of <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>, because it was then established by the whole <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> people gathered together in a single city. </p>
<p id='8.2.2'><b>8.2.2</b> The <prn id='Q188468'>Olympic games</prn> I leave out of the present account, because they are traced back to a time earlier than the human race, the story being that <prn id='Q44204'>Cronus</prn> and <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> wrestled there, and that the <prn id='Q247617'>Curetes</prn> were the first to race at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>. My view is that <prn id='Q501667'>Lycaon</prn> was contemporary with <prn id='Q500739'>Cecrops</prn>, the king of <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, but that they were not equally wise in matters of religion. </p>
<p id='8.2.3'><b>8.2.3</b> For <prn id='Q500739'>Cecrops</prn> was the first to name <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q107243158'>Hypatos</prn> (highest), and refused to sacrifice anything that had life in it, but burnt instead on the altar the national cakes which the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> still call pelanoi. But <prn id='Q501667'>Lycaon</prn> brought a human baby to the altar of <pl id='Q111046342'>Lycaean</pl> <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, and sacrificed it, pouring out its blood upon the altar, and according to the legend immediately after the sacrifice he was changed from a man to a <prn id='Q18498'>wolf</prn> (lykos). </p>
<p id='8.2.4'><b>8.2.4</b> I for my part believe this story; it has been a legend among the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> from of old, and it has the additional merit of probability. For the men of those days, because of their righteousness and piety, were guests of the gods, eating at the same board; the good were openly honored by the gods, and sinners were openly visited with their wrath. Nay, in those days men were changed to gods, who down to the present day have honors paid to them — <prn id='Q392435'>Aristaeus</prn>, <prn id='Q831577'>Britomartis</prn> of <pl id='Q4752820'>Crete</pl>, <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> the son of <prn id='Q190543'>Alcmena</prn>, <prn id='Q330584'>Amphiaraus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q1358973'>Oicles</prn>, and besides these <prn id='Q190103'>Polydeuces</prn> and <prn id='Q11294144'>Castor</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.2.5'><b>8.2.5</b> So one might believe that <prn id='Q501667'>Lycaon</prn> was turned into a beast, and <prn id='Q213621'>Niobe</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q182101'>Tantalus</prn>, into a stone. But at the present time, when sin has grown to such a height and has been spreading over every land and every city, no longer do men turn into gods, except in the flattering words addressed to despots, and the wrath of the gods is reserved until the sinners have departed to the next world. </p>
<p id='8.2.6'><b>8.2.6</b> All through the ages, many events that have occurred in the past, and even some that occur today, have been generally discredited because of the lies built up on a foundation of fact. It is said, for instance, that ever since the time of <prn id='Q501667'>Lycaon</prn> a man has changed into a <prn id='Q18498'>wolf</prn> at the sacrifice to <pl id='Q111046342'>Lycaean</pl> <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, but that the change is not for life; if, when he is a <prn id='Q18498'>wolf</prn>, he abstains from human flesh, after nine years he becomes a man again, but if he tastes human flesh he remains a beast for ever. </p>
<p id='8.2.7'><b>8.2.7</b> Similarly too it is said that <prn id='Q213621'>Niobe</prn> on Mount <pl id='Q532698'>Sipylus</pl> sheds tears in the season of summer. I have also heard that the griffins have spots like the leopard, and that the <prn id='Q1860727'>Tritons</prn> speak with human voice, though others say that they blow through a shell that has been bored. Those who like to listen to the miraculous are themselves apt to add to the marvel, and so they ruin truth by mixing it with falsehood. </p>
<p id='8.3.1'><b>8.3.1</b> In the third generation after <prn id='Q1636827'>Pelasgus</prn> the land increased in the number both of its cities and of its population. For <prn id='Q2599183'>Nyctimus</prn>, who was the eldest son of <prn id='Q501667'>Lycaon</prn>, possessed all the power, while the other sons founded cities on the sites they considered best.

<p id='8.3.4'><b>8.3.4</b> <prn id='Q6035819'>Maenalus</prn> founded <pl id='Q11936450'>Maenalus</pl>, which was in ancient times the most famous of the cities of <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl>, <prn id='Q3982573'>Tegeates</prn> founded <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl> and <prn id='Q10323875'>Mantineus</prn> <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineia</pl>. <pl id='Q11916188'>Cromi</pl> was named after <prn id='Q5392510'>Cromus</prn>, <pl id='Q5074395'>Charisia</pl> after <prn id='Q1001949'>Charisius</prn>, its founder, <pl id='Q16331632'>Tricoloni</pl> after <prn id='Q16331636'>Tricolonus</prn>, <pl id='Q39081772'>Peraethenses</pl> after <prn id='Q105973988'>Peraethus</prn>, <pl id='Q60791566'>Asea</pl> after <prn id='Q5708021'>Aseatas</prn>, <pl id='Q11934312'>Lycoa</pl> after . . . 4 and <pl id='Q39081737'>Soumetia</pl> after <prn id='Q105974115'>Soumateus</prn>. <prn id='Q4726821'>Alipherus</prn> <pl id='Q38281053'>also</pl> and <prn id='Q5894803'>Heraeus</prn> both gave their names to <pl id='Q3562285'>cities</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.3.5'><b>8.3.5</b> But <prn id='Q2715690'>Oenotrus</prn>, the youngest of the sons of <prn id='Q501667'>Lycaon</prn>, asked his brother <prn id='Q2599183'>Nyctimus</prn> for money and men and crossed by sea to <pl id='Q913582'>Italy</pl>; the land of <pl id='Q922562'>Oenotria</pl> received its name from <prn id='Q2715690'>Oenotrus</prn> who was its king. This was the first expedition despatched from Greece to found a colony, and if a man makes the most careful calculation possible he will discover that no foreigners either emigrated to another land before <prn id='Q2715690'>Oenotrus</prn>. In addition to all this male issue, <prn id='Q501667'>Lycaon</prn> had a daughter <prn id='Q203673'>Callisto</prn>. This <prn id='Q203673'>Callisto</prn> (I repeat the current Greek legend) was loved by <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> and mated with him. When <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> detected the intrigue she turned <prn id='Q203673'>Callisto</prn> into a bear, and <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> to please <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> shot the bear. <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> sent <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> with orders to save the child that <prn id='Q203673'>Callisto</prn> bore in her womb, </p>
<p id='8.3.6'><b>8.3.6</b> and <prn id='Q203673'>Callisto</prn> herself he turned into the constellation known as the Great Bear, which is mentioned by <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> in the return voyage of <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn> from <prn id='Q48961'>Calypso</prn>: <br>“Gazing at the <prn id='Q922942'>Pleiades</prn> and late-setting <prn id='Q8667'>Bootes</prn>, <br>And the Bear, which they also call the Wain.” <br>But it may be that the constellation is merely named in honor of <prn id='Q203673'>Callisto</prn>, since her grave is pointed out by the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.4.1'><b>8.4.1</b> After the death of <prn id='Q2599183'>Nyctimus</prn>, <prn id='Q606422'>Arcas</prn> the son of <prn id='Q203673'>Callisto</prn> came to the throne. He introduced the cultivation of crops, which he learned from <prn id='Q269243'>Triptolemus</prn>, and taught men to make bread, to weave clothes, and other things besides, having learned the art of spinning from Adristas. After this king the land was called <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl> instead of PelasgiaYY and its inhabitants <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> instead of Pelasgians. </p>
<p id='8.4.2'><b>8.4.2</b> His wife, according to the legend, was no mortal woman but a <prn id='Q202474'>Dryad</prn> nymph. For they used to call some nymphs <prn id='Q202474'>Dryads</prn>, others <prn id='Q2006573'>Epimeliads</prn>, and others <prn id='Q182037'>Naiads</prn>, and <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> in his poetry talks mostly of <prn id='Q182037'>Naiad</prn> nymphs. This nymph they call <prn id='Q782764'>Erato</prn>, and by her they say that <prn id='Q606422'>Arcas</prn> had <prn id='Q793560'>Azan</prn>, <prn id='Q3606201'>Apheidas</prn> and <prn id='Q1325009'>Elatus</prn>. Previously he had had <prn id='Q4826358'>Autolaus</prn>, an illegitimate son. </p>
<p id='8.4.3'><b>8.4.3</b> When his sons grew up, <prn id='Q606422'>Arcas</prn> divided the land between them into three parts, and one district was named <pl id='Q60791680'>Azania</pl> after <prn id='Q793560'>Azan</prn>; from <pl id='Q60791680'>Azania</pl>, it is said, settled the colonists who dwell about the cave in <pl id='Q32579'>Phrygia</pl> called Steunos and the river Pencalas. To <prn id='Q3606201'>Apheidas</prn> fell <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl> and the land adjoining, and for this reason poets too call <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl> “the lot of <prn id='Q3606201'>Apheidas</prn>.” </p>
<p id='8.4.4'><b>8.4.4</b> <prn id='Q1325009'>Elatus</prn> got Mount <pl id='Q1232572'>Cyllene</pl>, which down to that time had received no name.

It is said that <prn id='Q793560'>Azan</prn> had a son <prn id='Q3680855'>Cleitor</prn>, <prn id='Q3606201'>Apheidas</prn> a son <prn id='Q1536527'>Aleus</prn>, and that <prn id='Q1325009'>Elatus</prn> had five sons, <prn id='Q406434'>Aepytus</prn>, <prn id='Q3899772'>Pereus</prn>, <prn id='Q59200471'>Cyllen</prn>, <prn id='Q2479189'>Ischys</prn>, and <prn id='Q775176'>Stymphalus</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.4.5'><b>8.4.5</b> On the death of <prn id='Q793560'>Azan</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q606422'>Arcas</prn>, athletic contests were held for the first time; horse-races were certainly held, but I cannot speak positively about other contests. Now <prn id='Q3680855'>Cleitor</prn> the son of <prn id='Q793560'>Azan</prn> dwelt in <pl id='Q1878714'>Lycosura</pl>, and was the most powerful of the kings, founding <pl id='Q2537130'>Cleitor</pl>, which he named after himself; <prn id='Q1536527'>Aleus</prn> held his father's portion. </p>
<p id='8.4.6'><b>8.4.6</b> Of the sons of <prn id='Q1325009'>Elatus</prn>, <prn id='Q59200471'>Cyllen</prn> gave his name to Mount <pl id='Q1232572'>Cyllene</pl>, and <prn id='Q775176'>Stymphalus</prn> gave his to the spring and to the city <pl id='Q2359730'>Stymphalus</pl> near the spring. The story of the death of <prn id='Q2479189'>Ischys</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q1325009'>Elatus</prn>, I have already told in my history of <pl id='Q12649101'>Argolis</pl>. <prn id='Q3899772'>Pereus</prn>, they say, had no male child, but only a daughter, <prn id='Q3874208'>Neaera</prn>. She married <prn id='Q463107'>Autolycus</prn>, who lived on Mount <pl id='Q105261'>Parnassus</pl>, and was said to be a son of <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn>, although his real father was Daedalion. </p>
<p id='8.4.7'><b>8.4.7</b> <prn id='Q3680855'>Cleitor</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q793560'>Azan</prn>, had no children, and the sovereignty of the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> devolved upon <prn id='Q406434'>Aepytus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q1325009'>Elatus</prn>.

This species of <prn id='Q2102'>snake</prn> I have myself seen. It is like the smallest kind of adder, of the color of ash, with spots dotted here and there. It has a broad head and a narrow neck, a large belly and a short tail. This <prn id='Q2102'>snake</prn>, like another called cerastes (the horned snake), walks with a sidelong motion, as do crabs. </p>
<p id='8.4.8'><b>8.4.8</b> After <prn id='Q406434'>Aepytus</prn> <prn id='Q1536527'>Aleus</prn> came to the throne. For <prn id='Q2826403'>Agamedes</prn> and <prn id='Q3773593'>Gortys</prn>, the sons of <prn id='Q775176'>Stymphalus</prn>, were three generations removed from <prn id='Q606422'>Arcas</prn>, and <prn id='Q1536527'>Aleus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q3606201'>Apheidas</prn>, two generations. <prn id='Q1536527'>Aleus</prn> built the <pl id='Q3983230'>old sanctuary</pl> in <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl> of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> <prn id='Q1857789'>Alea</prn>, and made <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl> the capital of his kingdom. <prn id='Q3773593'>Gortys</prn> the son of <prn id='Q775176'>Stymphalus</prn> founded the city <pl id='Q1538431'>Gortys</pl> on a river which is also called after him.

<p id='8.4.9'><b>8.4.9</b> <prn id='Q242270'>Hecataeus</prn> says that this <prn id='Q760213'>Auge</prn> used to have intercourse with <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> when he came to <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl>. At last it was discovered that she had borne a child to <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, and <prn id='Q1536527'>Aleus</prn>, putting her with her infant son in a chest, sent them out to sea. She came to <prn id='Q1395752'>Teuthras</prn>, lord of the plain of the <pl id='Q1737602'>Caicus</pl>, who fell in love with her and married her. The tomb of <prn id='Q760213'>Auge</prn> still exists at <pl id='Q18986'>Pergamus</pl> above the Calcus; it is a mound of earth surrounded by a basement of stone and surmounted by a figure of a naked woman in bronze. </p>
<p id='8.4.10'><b>8.4.10</b> After the death of <prn id='Q1536527'>Aleus</prn> <prn id='Q609650'>Lycurgus</prn> his son got the kingdom as being the eldest; he is notorious for killing, by treachery and not in fair fight, a warrior called <prn id='Q12873977'>Areithous</prn>. Of his two sons, <prn id='Q2446902'>Ancaeus</prn> and <prn id='Q60506600'>Epochus</prn>, the latter fell ill and died, while the former joined the expedition of <prn id='Q176758'>Jason</prn> to <pl id='Q183150'>Colchis</pl>; afterwards, while hunting down with <prn id='Q321541'>Meleager</prn> the <pl id='Q750313'>Calydonian</pl> <prn id='Q654379'>boar</prn>, he was killed by the brute. </p>
<p id='8.5.1'><b>8.5.1</b> So <prn id='Q609650'>Lycurgus</prn> outlived both his sons, and reached an extreme old age.

After the capture of <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl> the storm that overtook the Greeks on their return home carried <prn id='Q390492'>Agapenor</prn> and the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadian</pl> fleet to <pl id='Q644636'>Cyprus</pl>, and so <prn id='Q390492'>Agapenor</prn> became the founder of <pl id='Q22988494'>Paphos</pl>, and built the sanctuary of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> at <pl id='Q53556453'>Palaepaphos</pl> (Old Paphos). Up to that time the goddess had been worshipped by the <pl id='Q644636'>Cyprians</pl> in the locality called <pl id='Q3561710'>Golgi</pl> [shrine]. </p>
<p id='8.5.3'><b>8.5.3</b> Afterwards <prn id='Q105972209'>Laodice</prn>, a descendant of <prn id='Q390492'>Agapenor</prn>, sent to <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl> a peplos (robe) as a gift for <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> <prn id='Q1857789'>Alea</prn>.

No remarkable event is recorded of his life, except that he established as the capital of his kingdom not <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl> but <pl id='Q7835586'>Trapezus</pl>. <prn id='Q406441'>Aepytus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q4138835'>Hippothous</prn>, succeeded his father to the throne, and <prn id='Q192407'>Orestes</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn>, in obedience to an oracle of the <pl id='Q682558'>Delphic</pl> <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, moved his home from <pl id='Q132564'>Mycenae</pl> to <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.5.5'><b>8.5.5</b> <prn id='Q406441'>Aepytus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q4138835'>Hippothous</prn>, dared to enter the <pl id='Q17574778'>sanctuary</pl> of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> at <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineia</pl>, into which no mortal was, just as no mortal today is, allowed to pass; on entering it he was struck blind, and shortly after this calamity he died. </p>
<p id='8.5.6'><b>8.5.6</b> <prn id='Q406441'>Aepytus</prn> was succeeded as king by his son <prn id='Q1247318'>Cypselus</prn>, and in his reign the <prn id='Q203711'>Dorian</prn> expedition returned to the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl>, not, as three generations before, across the <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthian</pl> <pl id='Q215200'>Isthmus</pl>, but by sea to the place called <pl id='Q24990480'>Rhium</pl>. <prn id='Q1247318'>Cypselus</prn>, learning about the expedition, married his daughter to the son of <prn id='Q311536'>Aristomachus</prn> whom he found without a wife, and so winning over <prn id='Q1788026'>Cresphontes</prn> he himself and the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> had nothing at all to fear. </p>
<p id='8.5.7'><b>8.5.7</b> <prn id='Q11682562'>Holaeas</prn> was the son of <prn id='Q1247318'>Cypselus</prn>, who, aided by the <prn id='Q828084'>Heracleidae</prn> from <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl> and <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>, restored to <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl> his sister's son <prn id='Q406443'>Aepytus</prn>. <prn id='Q11682562'>Holaeas</prn> had a son <prn id='Q5734880'>Bucolion</prn>, and he a son <prn id='Q2835975'>Phialus</prn>, who robbed <prn id='Q105972986'>Phigalus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q501667'>Lycaon</prn>, the founder of <pl id='Q7623270'>Phigalia</pl>, of the honor of giving his name to the city; <prn id='Q2835975'>Phialus</prn> changed it to Phialia, after his own name, but the change did not win universal acceptance. </p>
<p id='8.5.8'><b>8.5.8</b> In the reign of <prn id='Q11703875'>Simus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q2835975'>Phialus</prn>, the people of <pl id='Q7623270'>Phigalia</pl> lost by fire the ancient wooden image of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> <prn id='Q107247911'>Melaene</prn>. This loss proved to be a sign that <prn id='Q11703875'>Simus</prn> himself also was soon to meet his end. <prn id='Q11703875'>Simus</prn> was succeeded as king by <prn id='Q9061634'>Pompus</prn> his son, in whose reign the <pl id='Q191082'>Aeginetans</pl> made trading voyages as far as <pl id='Q56650616'>Cyllene</pl>, from which place they carried their cargoes up country on pack-animals to the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl>. In return for this <prn id='Q9061634'>Pompus</prn> honored the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> greatly, and furthermore gave the name <prn id='Q5820385'>Aeginetes</prn> to his son out of friendship for the <pl id='Q191082'>Aeginetans</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.5.9'><b>8.5.9</b> After <prn id='Q5820385'>Aeginetes</prn> his son <prn id='Q2288153'>Polymestor</prn> became king of the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl>, and it was then that <prn id='Q176022'>Charillus</prn> and the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> for the first time invaded the land of <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl> with an army. They were defeated in battle by the people of <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl>, who, men and women alike, flew to arms; the whole army, including <prn id='Q176022'>Charillus</prn> himself, were taken prisoners. <prn id='Q176022'>Charillus</prn> and his army I shall mention at greater length in my account of <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.5.10'><b>8.5.10</b> <prn id='Q2288153'>Polymestor</prn> had no children, and <prn id='Q5817064'>Aechmis</prn> succeeded to the throne, who was the son of <prn id='Q5733718'>Briacas</prn>, and the nephew of <prn id='Q2288153'>Polymestor</prn>. For <prn id='Q5733718'>Briacas</prn> too was a son of <prn id='Q5820385'>Aeginetes</prn>, but younger than <prn id='Q2288153'>Polymestor</prn>. After <prn id='Q5817064'>Aechmis</prn> came to the throne occurred the war between the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> and the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>. The <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> had from the first been friendly to the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>, and on this occasion they openly fought against the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> on the side of <prn id='Q2709649'>Aristodemus</prn>, the king of <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.5.11'><b>8.5.11</b> <prn id='Q4581536'>Aristocrates</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q5817064'>Aechmis</prn>, may have been guilty of outrages against the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> of his most impious acts, however, against the gods I have sure knowledge, and I will proceed to relate them. There is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, surnamed <prn id='Q106447518'>Hymnia</prn>, standing on the borders of <pl id='Q1855083'>Orchomenus</pl>, near the territory of <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineia</pl>. <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> <prn id='Q106447518'>Hymnia</prn> has been worshipped by all the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> from the most remote period. At that time the office of priestess to the goddess was still always held by a girl who was a virgin. </p>
<p id='8.5.12'><b>8.5.12</b> The maiden persisted in resisting the advances of <prn id='Q4581536'>Aristocrates</prn>, but at last, when she had taken refuge in the sanctuary, she was outraged by him near the image of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>. When the crime came to be generally known, the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> stoned the culprit, and also changed the rule for the future; as priestess of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> they now appoint, not a virgin, but a woman who has had enough of intercourse with men. </p>
<p id='8.5.13'><b>8.5.13</b> This man had a son <prn id='Q12878149'>Hicetas</prn>, and <prn id='Q12878149'>Hicetas</prn> had a son <prn id='Q666652'>Aristocrates</prn> the second, named after his grandfather and also meeting with a death like his. For he too was stoned by the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl>, who discovered that he had received bribes from <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl>, and that the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> disaster at the <prn id='Q3636289'>Great Trench</prn> was caused by the treachery of <prn id='Q666652'>Aristocrates</prn>. This sin explains why the kingship was taken from the whole house of <prn id='Q430688'>Cypselus</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.6.1'><b>8.6.1</b> I spent much care upon the history of the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadian</pl> kings, and the genealogy as given above was told me by the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> themselves. Of their memorable achievements the oldest is the <prn id='Q42937'>Trojan War</prn>; then comes the help they gave the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> in their struggle against <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl>, and they also took part in the action at <pl id='Q204636'>Plataea</pl> against the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.6.2'><b>8.6.2</b> It was compulsion rather than sympathy that made them join the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> in their war against <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> and in crossing over to <prn id='Q48'>Asia</prn> with <prn id='Q271850'>Agesilaus</prn>; they also followed the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> to <pl id='Q2606004'>Leuctra</pl> in <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl>. Their distrust of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> was shown on many occasions; in particular, immediately after the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> reverse at <pl id='Q2606004'>Leuctra</pl> they seceded from them and joined the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl>. Though they did not fight on the Greek side against <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn> and the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> at <pl id='Q13574678'>Chaeroneia</pl>, nor later in <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessaly</pl> against <prn id='Q204760'>Antipater</prn>, yet they did not actually range themselves against the Greeks. </p>
<p id='8.6.3'><b>8.6.3</b> It was because of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, they say, that they took no part in resisting the Gallic threat to <pl id='Q194450'>Thermopylae</pl>; they feared that their land would be laid waste in the absence of their men of military age. As members of the <prn id='Q244796'>Achaean League</prn> the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> were more enthusiastic than any other Greeks. The fortunes of each individual city, as distinct from those of the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadian</pl> people as a whole, I shall reserve for their proper place in my narrative. </p>
<p id='8.6.4'><b>8.6.4</b> There is a pass into <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl> on the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl> side in the direction of <pl id='Q16575296'>Hysiae</pl> and over Mount <pl id='Q833949'>Parthenius</pl> into <pl id='Q645234'>Tegean</pl> territory. There are two others on the side of <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineia</pl>: one through what is called Prinus and one through the Ladder (Klimax. The latter is the broader, and its descent had steps that were once cut into it. Crossing Klimax you come to a place called <pl id='Q6811232'>Melangeia</pl>, from which the drinking water of the <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineans</pl> flows down to their city. </p>
<p id='8.6.5'><b>8.6.5</b> Farther off from <pl id='Q6811232'>Melangeia</pl>, about seven stades distant from <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineia</pl>, there is a fountain called the Krene of the Meliasts. These Meliasts celebrate the orgies of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>. Near the krene is a megaron of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> and a sanctuary of Black <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>. This surname of the goddess is simply due to the fact that men do not, as the beasts do, have sexual intercourse always by day, but in most cases by night. </p>
<p id='8.6.6'><b>8.6.6</b> The second road is less broad than the other, and leads over Mount <pl id='Q25105451'>Artemisius</pl>. I have already made mention of this mountain, noting that on it are a temple and image of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, and also the springs of the <pl id='Q677269'>Inachus</pl>. The river <pl id='Q677269'>Inachus</pl>, so long as it flows by the road across the mountain, is the boundary between the territory of <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> and that of <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineia</pl>. But when it turns away from the road the stream flows through <pl id='Q12649101'>Argolis</pl> from this point on, and for this reason <prn id='Q40939'>Aeschylus</prn> among others calls the <pl id='Q677269'>Inachus</pl> an <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl> river. </p>
<p id='8.7.1'><b>8.7.1</b> After crossing into <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantinean</pl> country over Mount <pl id='Q25105451'>Artemisius</pl> you will come to a plain called the <pl id='Q70091883'>Argon pedion</pl> (Untilled Plain), whose name well describes it, for the rain-water coming down into it from the mountains prevents the plain from being tilled; nothing indeed could prevent it from being a lake, were it not that the water disappears into a chasm in the earth. </p>
<p id='8.7.2'><b>8.7.2</b> After disappearing here it rises again at <pl id='Q66813871'>Dine</pl> (Whirlpool). <pl id='Q66813871'>Dine</pl> is a stream of fresh water rising out of the sea by what is called Genethlium in <pl id='Q12649101'>Argolis</pl>. In olden times the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> cast <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn> adorned with bridles down into <pl id='Q66813871'>Dine</pl> as an offering to <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>. Not only here in <pl id='Q12649101'>Argolis</pl>, but also by <pl id='Q5089691'>Cheimerium</pl> in <pl id='Q2551754'>Thesprotis</pl>, is there unmistakably fresh water rising up in the sea. </p>
<p id='8.7.3'><b>8.7.3</b> A greater marvel still is the water that boils in the <pl id='Q211089'>Maeander</pl>, which comes partly from a rock surrounded by the stream, and partly rises from the mud of the river. In front of <pl id='Q72425'>Dicaearchia</pl> also, in the land of the <pl id='Q206730'>Etruscans</pl>, there is water boiling in the sea, and an artificial island has been made through it, so that this water is not “untilled,” but serves for hot baths. </p>
<p id='8.7.4'><b>8.7.4</b> In the territory of the <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineans</pl> on the left of the plain called <pl id='Q70091883'>Argon</pl> is a mountain, on which are the ruins of a camp of <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q313907'>Amyntas</prn>, and of a village called <pl id='Q60791907'>Nestane</pl>. For it is said that by this <pl id='Q60791907'>Nestane</pl> <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn> made an encampment, and the spring here they still call Philippium after the king. <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn> came to <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl> to bring over the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> to his side, and to separate them from the rest of the Greek people. </p>
<p id='8.7.5'><b>8.7.5</b> <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn> may be supposed to have accomplished exploits greater than those of any <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonian</pl> king who reigned either before or after. But nobody of sound mind would call him a good general, for no man has so sinned by continually trampling on oaths to heaven, and by breaking treaties and dishonoring his word on every occasion. </p>
<p id='8.7.6'><b>8.7.6</b> The wrath of heaven was not late in visiting him; never in fact have we known it more speedy. When he was but forty-six years old, <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn> fulfilled the oracle that it is said was given him when he inquired of <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> about the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl>: “The <prn id='Q693690'>bull</prn> is crowned; the consummation is at hand; the sacrificer is ready. Very soon afterwards events showed that this oracle pointed, not to the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl>, but to <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn> himself. </p>
<p id='8.7.7'><b>8.7.7</b> On the death of <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn>, his infant son by <prn id='Q257526'>Cleopatra</prn>, the niece of <prn id='Q356050'>Attalus</prn>, was along with his mother dragged by <prn id='Q223134'>Olympias</prn> on to a bronze vessel and burned to death. Afterwards <prn id='Q223134'>Olympias</prn> killed <prn id='Q295530'>Aridaeus</prn> also. It turned out that the god intended to mow down to destruction the family of <prn id='Q207183'>Cassander</prn> as well. <prn id='Q207183'>Cassander</prn>'s sons were by <prn id='Q242293'>Thessalonice</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn>, and both <prn id='Q242293'>Thessalonice</prn> and <prn id='Q295530'>Aridaeus</prn> had <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessalian</pl> women for their mothers. The fate of <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn> is familiar to everybody alike. </p>
<p id='8.7.8'><b>8.7.8</b> But if <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn> had taken to heart the fate of the <pl id='Q5690'>Spartan</pl> <prn id='Q106043726'>Glaucus</prn>, and at each of his acts had bethought himself of the verse: — “If a man keeps his oath his family prospers hereafter;” then, I believe, some god would not have extinguished so relentlessly the life of <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn> and, at the same time, the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonian</pl> supremacy. </p>
<p id='8.8.1'><b>8.8.1</b> So much by way of a digression. After the ruins of <pl id='Q60791907'>Nestane</pl> is a holy sanctuary of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>, and every year the <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineans</pl> hold a festival in her honor. By <pl id='Q60791907'>Nestane</pl> there lies, on lower ground, about . . . itself too forming part of the <pl id='Q70091883'>Untilled Plain</pl>, and it is called the Dancing Floor of <prn id='Q3854794'>Maera</prn>. The road across the <pl id='Q70091883'>Untilled Plain</pl> is about ten stades. After crossing it you will descend, a little farther on, into another plain. On it, alongside the highway, is a well called Arne (lamb). </p>
<p id='8.8.2'><b>8.8.2</b> The following story is told by the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl>. When <prn id='Q108419'>Rhea</prn> had given birth to <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, she laid him in a flock for him to live there with the lambs, and the spring too received its name just because the lambs pastured around it. <prn id='Q108419'>Rhea</prn>, it is said, declared to <prn id='Q44204'>Cronus</prn> that she had given birth to a <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn>, and gave him a foal to swallow instead of the child, just as later she gave him in place of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> a stone wrapped up in swaddling clothes. </p>
<p id='8.8.3'><b>8.8.3</b> When I began to write my history I was inclined to count these legends as foolishness, but on getting as far as <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl> I grew to hold a more thoughtful view of them, which is this. In the days of old those Greeks who were considered wise spoke their sayings not straight out but in riddles, and so the legends about <prn id='Q44204'>Cronus</prn> I conjectured to be one sort of Greek wisdom. In matters of divinity, therefore, I shall adopt the received tradition. </p>
<p id='8.8.4'><b>8.8.4</b> The city of the <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineans</pl> is about twelve stades farther away from this spring. Now there are plain indications that it was in another place that <prn id='Q10323875'>Mantineus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q501667'>Lycaon</prn> founded his city, which even today is called PtolisYY (City) by the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl>. From here, in obedience to an oracle, <prn id='Q4067040'>Antinoe</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q1509662'>Cepheus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q1536527'>Aleus</prn>, removed the inhabitants to the modern site, accepting as a guide for the pilgrimage a <prn id='Q2102'>snake</prn>; the breed of <prn id='Q2102'>snake</prn> is not recorded. It is for this reason that the river, which flows by the modern city, has received the name OphisYY (<prn id='Q2102'>Snake</prn>). </p>
<p id='8.8.5'><b>8.8.5</b> If we may base a conjecture on the verses of <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>, we are led to believe that this <prn id='Q2102'>snake</prn> was a dragon. When in the list of ships he tells how the Greeks abandoned <prn id='Q212827'>Philoctetes</prn> in <pl id='Q192483'>Lemnos</pl> suffering from his wound, he does not style the water-<prn id='Q2102'>serpent</prn> a <prn id='Q2102'>snake</prn>. But the dragon that the <prn id='Q2092297'>eagle</prn> dropped among the <pl id='Q22647'>Trojans</pl> he does call a <prn id='Q2102'>snake</prn>. So it is likely that <prn id='Q4067040'>Antinoe</prn>'s guide also was a dragon. </p>
<p id='8.8.6'><b>8.8.6</b> The <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineans</pl> did not fight on the side of the other <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> against the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> at <pl id='Q1227119'>Dipaea</pl>, but in the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesian</pl> war they rose with the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> against the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, and joined in battle with them after the arrival of reinforcements from <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>. Their friendship with the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> led them to take part also in the <pl id='Q4951156'>Sicilian</pl> expedition. </p>
<p id='8.8.7'><b>8.8.7</b> Later on a <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> army under <prn id='Q357594'>Agesipolis</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q433408'>Pausanias</prn>, invaded their territory. <prn id='Q357594'>Agesipolis</prn> was victorious in the battle and shut up the <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineans</pl> within their walls, capturing the city shortly after. He did not take it by storm, but turned the river <prn id='Q106042343'>Ophis</prn> against its fortifications, which were made of unburnt brick. </p>
<p id='8.8.8'><b>8.8.8</b> Now against the blows of engines brick brings greater security than fortifications built of stone. For stones break and are dislodged from their fittings; brick, however, does not suffer so much from engines, but it crumbles under the action of water just as wax is melted by the sun. </p>
<p id='8.8.9'><b>8.8.9</b> This method of demolishing the fortifications of the <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineans</pl> was not discovered by <prn id='Q357594'>Agesipolis</prn>. It was a stratagem invented at an earlier date by <prn id='Q218102'>Cimon</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q210350'>Miltiades</prn>, when he was besieging <prn id='Q8249134'>Boges</prn> and the other <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl> who were holding <pl id='Q1268859'>Eion</pl> on the <pl id='Q204127'>Strymon</pl>. <prn id='Q357594'>Agesipolis</prn> only copied an established custom, and one celebrated among the Greeks. After taking <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineia</pl>, he left a small part of it inhabited, but by far the greater part he razed to the ground, settling the inhabitants in villages. </p>
<p id='8.8.10'><b>8.8.10</b> <prn id='Q180287'>Fate</prn> decreed that the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> should restore the <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineans</pl> from the villages to their own country after the engagement at <pl id='Q2606004'>Leuctra</pl>, but when restored they proved far from grateful. They were caught treating with the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> and intriguing for a peace with them privately without reference to the rest of the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadian</pl> people. So through their fear of the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> they openly changed sides and joined the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> confederacy, and when the battle took place at <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineia</pl> between the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> and the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> under <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn>, the <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineans</pl> joined the ranks of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.8.11'><b>8.8.11</b> Subsequently the <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineans</pl> quarrelled with the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, and seceded from them to the <prn id='Q244796'>Achaean League</prn>. They defeated <prn id='Q299479'>Agis</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q889042'>Eudamidas</prn>, king of <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>, in defence of their own country, with the help of an <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaean</pl> army under the leadership of <prn id='Q317331'>Aratus</prn>. They also joined the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> in their struggle against <prn id='Q310811'>Cleomenes</prn> and helped to destroy the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> power. <prn id='Q108816'>Antigonus</prn> of <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl>, who was guardian of <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn>, the father of <prn id='Q207363'>Perseus</prn>, before he came of age, was an ardent supporter of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, and so the <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineans</pl>, among other honors, changed the name of their city to <pl id='Q1160195'>Antigoneia</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.8.12'><b>8.8.12</b> Afterwards, when <prn id='Q1405'>Augustus</prn> was about to fight the naval engagement off the cape of <pl id='Q216551'>Actian</pl> <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, the <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineans</pl> fought on the side of the Romans, while the rest of <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl> joined the ranks of <prn id='Q51673'>Antonius</prn>, for no other reason, so it seems to me, except that the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> favoured the cause of <prn id='Q1405'>Augustus</prn>. Ten generations afterwards, when <prn id='Q1427'>Hadrian</prn> became Emperor, he took away from the <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineans</pl> the name imported from <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl>, and gave back to their city its old name of <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineia</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.9.1'><b>8.9.1</b> The <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineans</pl> possess a temple composed of two parts, being divided almost exactly at the middle by a wall. In one part of the temple is an image of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>, made by <prn id='Q505640'>Alcamenes</prn>; the other part is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q103107'>Leto</prn> and her children, and their images were made by <prn id='Q105290'>Praxiteles</prn> two generations after <prn id='Q505640'>Alcamenes</prn>. On the pedestal of these are figures of <prn id='Q66016'>Muses</prn> together with <prn id='Q599737'>Marsyas</prn> playing the flute. Here there is a figure of <prn id='Q131169'>Polybius</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q2065138'>Lycortas</prn>, carved in relief upon a slab, of whom I shall make fuller mention later on. </p>
<p id='8.9.2'><b>8.9.2</b> The <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineans</pl> have other sanctuaries also, one of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q2303797'>Saviour</prn>, and one of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q5382860'>Epidotes</prn> (giver of gifts), in that he gives good things to men. There is also a sanctuary of the <prn id='Q190103'>Dioscuri</prn>, and in another place one of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> and <prn id='Q45967'>Kore</prn>. Here they keep a fire, taking anxious care not to let it go out. Near the theater I saw a temple of <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.9.3'><b>8.9.3</b> <prn id='Q105290'>Praxiteles</prn> made the images <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> is sitting, while <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> and <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn>'s daughter <prn id='Q131125'>Hebe</prn> are standing by her side. Near the altar of <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> is the grave of <prn id='Q606422'>Arcas</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q203673'>Callisto</prn>. The bones of <prn id='Q606422'>Arcas</prn> they brought from <pl id='Q11936450'>Maenalus</pl>, in obedience to an oracle delivered to them from <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>: </p>
<p id='8.9.4'><b>8.9.4</b> <pl id='Q112302501'>Maenalia</pl> is storm-swept, where lies <br><prn id='Q606422'>Arcas</prn>, from whom all <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> are named, <br>In a place where meet three, four, even five roads; <br>Thither I bid you go, and with kind heart <br>Take up <prn id='Q606422'>Arcas</prn> and bring him back to your lovely city. <br>There make <prn id='Q606422'>Arcas</prn> a precinct and sacrifices.” <br>This place, where the grave of <prn id='Q606422'>Arcas</prn> is, they call Altars of <prn id='Q134270'>Helios</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.9.5'><b>8.9.5</b> Not far from the theater are famous tombs, one called Common Hearth, round in shape, where, they told me, lies <prn id='Q4067040'>Antinoe</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q1509662'>Cepheus</prn>. On it stands a slab, on which is carved in relief a horseman, <prn id='Q10291570'>Grylus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q129772'>Xenophon</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.9.6'><b>8.9.6</b> Behind the theater I found the ruins, with the cult statue missing, of a temple of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> surnamed <prn id='Q107349833'>Symmachia</prn> (ally). The inscription on the pedestal announced that the statue was dedicated by <prn id='Q106887312'>Nicippe</prn>, the daughter of PaseasYY. This sanctuary was made by the <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineans</pl> to remind posterity of their fighting on the side of the Romans at the battle of <pl id='Q160387'>Actium</pl>. They also worship <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> <prn id='Q1857789'>Alea</prn>, of whom they have a sanctuary and an image. </p>
<p id='8.9.7'><b>8.9.7</b> <prn id='Q171876'>Antinous</prn> too was deified by them; his temple is the newest in <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineia</pl>. He was a great favorite of the Emperor <prn id='Q1427'>Hadrian</prn>. I never saw him in the flesh, but I have seen images and pictures of him. He has honors in other places also, and on the <pl id='Q3392'>Nile</pl> is an <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptian</pl> city named after <prn id='Q171876'>Antinous</prn>. He has won worship in <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineia</pl> for the following reason. <prn id='Q171876'>Antinous</prn> was by birth from Bithynium beyond the river <pl id='Q217466'>Sangarius</pl>, and the Bithynians are by descent <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> of <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineia</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.9.8'><b>8.9.8</b> For this reason the Emperor established his worship in <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineia</pl> also; mystic rites are celebrated in his honor each year, and games every four years. There is an oikos in the gymnasium of <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineia</pl> containing statues of <prn id='Q171876'>Antinous</prn>, and remarkable for the stones with which it is adorned, and especially so for its pictures. Most of them are portraits of <prn id='Q171876'>Antinous</prn>, who is made to look just like <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>. There is also a copy here of the painting in the <pl id='Q630974'>Cerameicus</pl> which represented the engagement of the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> at <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineia</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.9.9'><b>8.9.9</b> In the agora is a bronze portrait-statue of a woman, said by the <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineans</pl> to be <prn id='Q106446748'>Diomeneia</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q606422'>Arcas</prn>, and a hero-shrine of <prn id='Q106044002'>Podares</prn>, who was killed, they say, in the battle with the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> under <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn>. Three generations ago they changed the inscription on the grave and made it apply to a descendant of this <prn id='Q106044002'>Podares</prn> with the same name, who was born late enough to have Roman citizenship. </p>
<p id='8.9.10'><b>8.9.10</b> In my time the elder <prn id='Q106044002'>Podares</prn> was honored by the <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineans</pl>, who said that he who proved the bravest in the battle, of themselves and of their allies, was <prn id='Q10291570'>Grylus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q129772'>Xenophon</prn>; next to <prn id='Q10291570'>Grylus</prn> was <prn id='Q85031200'>Cephisodorus</prn> of <pl id='Q13423602'>Marathon</pl>, who at the time commanded the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn>. The third place for valor they give to <prn id='Q106044002'>Podares</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.10.1'><b>8.10.1</b> There are roads leading from <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineia</pl> into the rest of <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl>, and I will go on to describe the most noteworthy objects on each of them. On the left of the highway leading to <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl> there is, beside the walls of <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineia</pl>, a place where <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn> race, and not far from it is a race-course, where they celebrate the games in honor of <prn id='Q171876'>Antinous</prn>. Above the race-course is Mount Alesium, so called from the wandering [ale] of <prn id='Q108419'>Rhea</prn>, on which is a grove of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.10.2'><b>8.10.2</b> By the foot of the mountain is the <pl id='Q17574778'>sanctuary</pl> of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> <prn id='Q20100719'>Hippios</prn>, not more than six stades distant from <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineia</pl>. About this sanctuary I, like everyone else who has mentioned it, can write only what I have heard. The modern sanctuary was built by the Emperor <prn id='Q1427'>Hadrian</prn>, who set overseers over the workmen, so that nobody might look into the old sanctuary, and none of the ruins be removed. He ordered them to build around the new temple. Originally, they say, this sanctuary was built for <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> by <prn id='Q390363'>Agamedes</prn> and <prn id='Q1166183'>Trophonius</prn>, who worked oak logs and fitted them together. </p>
<p id='8.10.3'><b>8.10.3</b> They set up no barrier at the entrance to prevent men going inside; but they stretched across it a thread of wool. Perhaps they thought that even this would strike fear into the religious people of that time, and perhaps there was also some power in the thread. It is notorious that even <prn id='Q406441'>Aepytus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q4138835'>Hippothous</prn>, entered the <pl id='Q17574778'>sanctuary</pl> neither by jumping over the thread nor by slipping under it, but by cutting it through. For this sin he was blinded by a wave that dashed on to his eyes, and forthwith his life left him. </p>
<p id='8.10.4'><b>8.10.4</b> There is an old legend that a wave of sea-water rises up in the <pl id='Q17574778'>sanctuary</pl>. A like story is told by the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> about the wave on the <pl id='Q131013'>Acropolis</pl>, and by the <pl id='Q193214'>Carians</pl> living in <pl id='Q3857824'>Mylasa</pl> about the sanctuary of the god called in the native tongue <prn id='Q106092358'>Osogoa</prn>. But the sea at <pl id='Q534927'>Phalerum</pl> is about twenty stades distant from <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, and the port of <pl id='Q3857824'>Mylasa</pl> is eighty stades from the city. But at <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineia</pl> the sea rises after a very long distance, and quite plainly through the divine will. </p>
<p id='8.10.5'><b>8.10.5</b> Beyond the <pl id='Q17574778'>sanctuary</pl> of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> is a trophy made of stone commemorating the victory over the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> under <prn id='Q299479'>Agis</prn>. The course of the battle was, it is said, after this wise. The right wing was held by the <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineans</pl> themselves, who put into the field all of military age under the command of <prn id='Q106044002'>Podares</prn>, the grandson of the <prn id='Q106044002'>Podares</prn> who fought against the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl>. They had with them also the <pl id='Q6536845'>Elean</pl> seer <prn id='Q45805945'>Thrasybulus</prn>, the son of Aeneas, one of the <prn id='Q5980707'>Iamids</prn>. This man foretold a victory for the <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineans</pl> and took a personal part in the fighting. </p>
<p id='8.10.6'><b>8.10.6</b> On the left wing was stationed all the rest of the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadian</pl> army, each city under its own leader, the contingent of <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl> being led by <prn id='Q11931923'>Lydiades</prn> and <prn id='Q107305182'>Leocydes</prn>. The center was entrusted to <prn id='Q317331'>Aratus</prn>, with the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl> and the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>. The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> under <prn id='Q299479'>Agis</prn>, who with the royal staff officers were in the center, extended their line so as to make it equal in length to that of their enemies. </p>
<p id='8.10.7'><b>8.10.7</b> <prn id='Q317331'>Aratus</prn>, acting on an arrangement with the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl>, fell back with his command, as though the pressure of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> was too severe. As they gave way they gradually made their formation crescent-shaped. The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> under <prn id='Q299479'>Agis</prn>, thinking that victory was theirs, pressed in close order yet harder on <prn id='Q317331'>Aratus</prn> and his men. They were followed by those on the wings, who thought it a great achievement to put to flight <prn id='Q317331'>Aratus</prn> and his host. </p>
<p id='8.10.8'><b>8.10.8</b> But the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> got in their rear unperceived, and the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> were surrounded, losing the greater part of their army, while King <prn id='Q299479'>Agis</prn> himself fell, the son of <prn id='Q889042'>Eudamidas</prn>. The <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineans</pl> affirmed that <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> too manifested himself in their defence, and for this reason they erected a trophy as an offering to <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.10.9'><b>8.10.9</b> That gods were present at war and slaughter of men has been told by the poets who have treated of the sufferings of heroes at <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl>, and the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> relate in song how gods sided with them at <pl id='Q31900'>Marathon</pl> and at the battle of <pl id='Q178850'>Salamis</pl>. Very plainly the host of the Gauls was destroyed at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> by the god, and manifestly by demons. So there is precedent for the story of the <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineans</pl> that they won their victory by the aid of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.10.10'><b>8.10.10</b> ArcesilauYY, an ancestor, ninth in descent, of <prn id='Q107305182'>Leocydes</prn>, who with <prn id='Q11931923'>Lydiades</prn> was general of the <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolitans</pl>, is said by the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> to have seen, when dwelling in <pl id='Q1878714'>Lycosura</pl>, the sacred deer, enfeebled with age, of the goddess called <prn id='Q1146978'>Despoina</prn>. This deer, they say, had a collar round its neck, with writing on the collar: “I was a fawn when captured, at the time when <prn id='Q390492'>Agapenor</prn> went to <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl>.” This story proves that the deer is an animal much longer-lived even than the elephant. </p>
<p id='8.11.1'><b>8.11.1</b> After the <pl id='Q17574778'>sanctuary of Poseidon</pl> you will come to a place full of oak trees, called Pelagos [sea], and the road from <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineia</pl> to <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl> leads through the oaks. The boundary between <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineia</pl> and <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl> is the round altar on the highroad. If you will turn aside to the left from the <pl id='Q17574778'>sanctuary of Poseidon</pl>, you will reach, after going just about five stades, the graves of the daughters of <prn id='Q182439'>Pelias</prn>. These, the <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineans</pl> say, came to live with them when they were fleeing from the scandal at their father's death. </p>
<p id='8.11.2'><b>8.11.2</b> Now when <prn id='Q174278'>Medea</prn> reached <pl id='Q662613'>Iolcus</pl>, she immediately began to plot against <prn id='Q182439'>Pelias</prn>; she was really conspiring with <prn id='Q176758'>Jason</prn>, while pretending to be at variance with him. She promised the daughters of <prn id='Q182439'>Pelias</prn> that, if they wished, she would restore his youth to their father, now a very old man. Having butchered in some way a ram, she boiled his flesh with drugs in a pot, by the aid of which she took out of the pot a live lamb. </p>
<p id='8.11.3'><b>8.11.3</b> So she took <prn id='Q182439'>Pelias</prn> and cut him up to boil him, but what the daughters received was not enough to bury. This result forced the women to change their home to <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl>, and after their death, mounds were made there for their tombs. No poet, so far as I have read, has given them names, but the painter <prn id='Q1387790'>Micon</prn> inscribed on their portraits <prn id='Q748980'>Asteropeia</prn> and <prn id='Q26690189'>Antinoe</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.11.4'><b>8.11.4</b> A place called Phoezon is about twenty stades distant from these graves. Phoezon is a tomb of stone surrounded with a krepis (basement), raised only a little above the ground. At this point the road becomes very narrow, and here, they say, is the tomb of <prn id='Q12873977'>Areithous</prn>, surnamed <prn id='Q58817554'>Corynetes</prn> (Clubman) because of his weapon. </p>
<p id='8.11.5'><b>8.11.5</b> As you go along the road leading from <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineia</pl> to <pl id='Q11939941'>Pallantium</pl>, at a distance of about thirty stades, the highway is skirted by the oak forest called of Pelagos (sea), and here the cavalry of the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> and <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineans</pl> fought against the <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotian</pl> <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn>. <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn>, the <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineans</pl> say, was killed by <prn id='Q106045510'>Machaerion</prn>, a man of <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineia</pl>. The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> on their part say that a <pl id='Q5690'>Spartan</pl> killed <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn>, but they too give <prn id='Q106045510'>Machaerion</prn> as the name of the man. </p>
<p id='8.11.6'><b>8.11.6</b> The <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> account, with which the <pl id='Q11225429'>Theban</pl> agrees, makes out that <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn> was wounded by <prn id='Q10291570'>Grylus</prn>. Similar is the story on the picture portraying the battle of <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineia</pl>. All can see that the <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineans</pl> gave <prn id='Q10291570'>Grylus</prn> a public funeral and dedicated where he fell his likeness on a slab in honor of the bravest of their allies. The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> also speak of <prn id='Q106045510'>Machaerion</prn> as the slayer, but actually at <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> there is no <prn id='Q106045510'>Machaerion</prn>, nor is there at <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineia</pl>, who has received honors for bravery. </p>
<p id='8.11.7'><b>8.11.7</b> When <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn> was wounded, they carried him still living from the ranks. For a while he kept his hand to the wound in agony, with his gaze fixed on the combatants, the place from which he looked at them being called Skope (look-out) by posterity. But when the combat came to an indecisive end, he took his hand away from the wound and died, being buried on the spot where the armies met. </p>
<p id='8.11.8'><b>8.11.8</b> On the <pl id='Q107162062'>grave</pl> stands a pillar, and on it is a shield with a dragon in relief. The dragon means that <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn> belonged to the race of those called the <prn id='Q598170'>Sparti</prn>, while there are slabs on the tomb, one old, with a <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotian</pl> inscription, the other dedicated by the Emperor <prn id='Q1427'>Hadrian</prn>, who wrote the inscription on it. </p>
<p id='8.11.9'><b>8.11.9</b> Everybody must praise <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn> for being the most famous Greek general, or at least consider him second to none other. For the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> and the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> leaders enjoyed the ancient reputation of their cities, while their soldiers were men of a spirit, but the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl>, whom <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn> raised to the highest position, were a disheartened people, accustomed to obey others. </p>
<p id='8.11.10'><b>8.11.10</b> <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn> had been told before by an oracle from <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> to beware the sea (pelagos). So he was afraid to step on board a man-of-war or to sail in a merchant-ship, but by “pelagos” the god indicated the grove “Pelagos” and not the sea. Places with the same name misled <prn id='Q36456'>Hannibal</prn> the Carthaginian, and before him the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> also. </p>
<p id='8.11.11'><b>8.11.11</b> <prn id='Q36456'>Hannibal</prn> received an oracle from <prn id='Q3575327'>Ammon</prn> that when he died he would be buried in Libyan earth. So he hoped to destroy the Roman empire, to return to his home in <pl id='Q2370577'>Libya</pl>, and there to die of old age. But when <prn id='Q349222'>Flamininus</prn> the Roman was anxious to take him alive, <prn id='Q36456'>Hannibal</prn> came to <prn id='Q372361'>Prusias</prn> as a suppliant. Repulsed by <prn id='Q372361'>Prusias</prn> he jumped upon his <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn>, but was wounded in the finger by his drawn sword. when he had proceeded only a few stades his wound caused a fever, and he died on the third day. The place where he died is called <pl id='Q65088659'>Libyssa</pl> by the <pl id='Q209349'>Nicomedians</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.11.12'><b>8.11.12</b> The <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> received an oracle from <pl id='Q382317'>Dodona</pl> ordering them to colonize <pl id='Q4951156'>Sicily</pl>, and <pl id='Q25163830'>Sikelia</pl> is a small hill not far from <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>. But they, not understanding the order, were persuaded to undertake expeditions overseas, especially the <pl id='Q4420718'>Syracusan</pl> war. More examples could be found similar to those I have given. </p>
<p id='8.12.1'><b>8.12.1</b> Just about a stade from the <pl id='Q107162062'>grave</pl> of <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn> is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> surnamed <prn id='Q57339233'>Charmon</prn>. The oaks in the groves of the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> are of different sorts; some of them are called “broad-leaved,” others “edible oaks.” A third kind have a hollow bark, which is so light that they actually make from it markers for anchors and nets. The bark of this oak is called phellon (cork) by the <prn id='Q465331'>Ionians</prn>, for example by <prn id='Q1613558'>Hermesianax</prn>, the elegiac poet. </p>
<p id='8.12.2'><b>8.12.2</b> From <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineia</pl> there is a road leading to <pl id='Q60790161'>Methydrium</pl>, which today is not a city, but only a village (kome) belonging to <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl>. Thirty stades farther is a plain called <prn id='Q21548243'>Alcimedon</prn>, and beyond the plain is Mount Ostracina, in which is a cave where dwelt <prn id='Q21548243'>Alcimedon</prn>, one of those called heroes. </p>
<p id='8.12.3'><b>8.12.3</b> This man's daughter, <prn id='Q7181590'>Phialo</prn>, had connection, say the <pl id='Q7623270'>Phigalians</pl>, with <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>. When <prn id='Q21548243'>Alcimedon</prn> realized that she had a child, he exposed her to perish on the mountain, and with her the baby boy she had borne, whom the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> call <prn id='Q3607060'>Aechmagoras</prn>. On being exposed the babe began to cry, and a jay heard him wailing and began to imitate his cries. </p>
<p id='8.12.4'><b>8.12.4</b> It happened that <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, passing along that road, heard the jay, and, thinking that the crying was that of a baby and not of a bird, turned straight to the voice. Recognizing <prn id='Q7181590'>Phialo</prn> he loosed her from her bonds and saved the baby. Wherefore the spring hard by is named CissaYY (Jay) after the bird. Forty stades distant from the spring is the place called Petrosaca, which is the boundary between <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl> and <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineia</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.12.5'><b>8.12.5</b> In addition to the roads mentioned there are two others, leading to <pl id='Q1855083'>Orchomenus</pl>. On one is what is called the Stadium of <prn id='Q11931075'>Ladas</prn>, where <prn id='Q11931075'>Ladas</prn> practised his running, and by it a sanctuary of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, and on the right of the road is a high mound of earth. It is said to be the grave of <prn id='Q165769'>Penelope</prn>, but the account of her in the poem called <prn id='Q18692166'>Thesprotis</prn> is not in agreement with this saying. </p>
<p id='8.12.6'><b>8.12.6</b> For in it the poet says that when <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn> returned from <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl> he had a son <prn id='Q3907372'>Ptoliporthes</prn> by <prn id='Q165769'>Penelope</prn>. But the <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantinean</pl> story about <prn id='Q165769'>Penelope</prn> says that <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn> convicted her of bringing paramours to his home, and being cast out by him she went away at first to <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl>, but afterwards she removed from <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> to <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineia</pl>, where she died. </p>
<p id='8.12.7'><b>8.12.7</b> Adjoining this grave is a plain of no great size, and on the plain is a mountain whereon still stand the ruins of old <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineia</pl>. Today the place is called PtolisYY. Advancing a little way to the north of it you come to the spring of Alalcomeneia, and thirty stades from PtolisYY are the ruins of a village called <prn id='Q3854794'>Maera</prn>, with the grave of <prn id='Q3854794'>Maera</prn>, if it be really the case that <prn id='Q3854794'>Maera</prn> was buried here and not in <pl id='Q645234'>Tegean</pl> land. For probably the <pl id='Q645234'>Tegeans</pl>, and not the <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineans</pl>, are right when they say that <prn id='Q3854794'>Maera</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q130818'>Atlas</prn>, was buried in their land. Perhaps, however, the <prn id='Q3854794'>Maera</prn> who came to the land of <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineia</pl> was another, a descendant of <prn id='Q3854794'>Maera</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q130818'>Atlas</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.12.8'><b>8.12.8</b> There still remains the road leading to <pl id='Q1855083'>Orchomenus</pl>, on which are Mount Anchisia and the tomb of <prn id='Q211953'>Anchises</prn> at the foot of the mountain. For when <prn id='Q82732'>Aeneas</prn> was voyaging to <pl id='Q4951156'>Sicily</pl>, he put in with his ships to <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconia</pl>, becoming the founder of the cities <pl id='Q15223793'>Aphrodisias</pl> and <pl id='Q16652109'>Etis</pl>; his father <prn id='Q211953'>Anchises</prn> for some reason or other came to this place and died there, where <prn id='Q82732'>Aeneas</prn> buried him. This mountain they call Anchisia after <prn id='Q211953'>Anchises</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.12.9'><b>8.12.9</b> The probability of this story is strengthened by the fact that the <pl id='Q255325'>Aeolians</pl> who today occupy <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl> nowhere point out a tomb of <prn id='Q211953'>Anchises</prn> in their own land. Near the grave of <prn id='Q211953'>Anchises</prn> are the ruins of a sanctuary of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>, and at Anchisiae is the boundary between <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineia</pl> and <pl id='Q1855083'>Orchomenus</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.13.1'><b>8.13.1</b> In the territory of <pl id='Q1855083'>Orchomenus</pl>, on the left of the road from Anchisiae, there is on the slope of the mountain the sanctuary of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> <prn id='Q106447518'>Hymnia</prn>. The <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineans</pl>, too, share it . . . a priestess also and a priest. It is the custom for these to live their whole lives in purity, not only sexual but in all respects, and they neither wash nor spend their lives as do ordinary people, nor do they enter the home of a private man. I know that the “entertainers” of the <pl id='Q43018'>Ephesian</pl> <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> live in a similar fashion, but for a year only, the <pl id='Q47611'>Ephesians</pl> calling them <prn id='Q189204'>Essenes</prn>. They also hold an annual festival in honor of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> <prn id='Q106447518'>Hymnia</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.13.2'><b>8.13.2</b> The former city of <pl id='Q1855083'>Orchomenus</pl> was on the peak of a mountain, and there still remain ruins of an agora and of walls. The modern, inhabited city lies under the circuit of the old wall. Worth seeing here is a spring, from which they draw water, and there are sanctuaries of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> and of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>, the images being of stone. Near the city is a wooden image of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>. It is set in a large cedar tree, and after the tree they call the goddess Kedreatis [cedar]. </p>
<p id='8.13.3'><b>8.13.3</b> Beneath the city are heaps of stones at intervals, which were piled over men who fell in war. With what <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesians</pl>, whether <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> or other, the war was fought, was set forth neither by inscriptions on the graves nor in <pl id='Q1855083'>Orchomenian</pl> tradition. </p>
<p id='8.13.4'><b>8.13.4</b> Opposite the city is Mount <pl id='Q16331617'>Trachy</pl> (Rough). The rain-water, flowing through a deep gully between the city and Mount <pl id='Q16331617'>Trachy</pl>, descends to another <pl id='Q1855083'>Orchomenian</pl> plain, which is very considerable in extent, but the greater part of it is a lake. As you go out of <pl id='Q1855083'>Orchomenus</pl>, after about three stades, the straight road leads you to the city <pl id='Q2365548'>Caphya</pl>, along the side of the gully and afterwards along the water of the lake on the left. The other road, after you have crossed the water flowing through the gully, goes under Mount <pl id='Q16331617'>Trachy</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.13.5'><b>8.13.5</b> On this road the first thing is the tomb of <prn id='Q4581536'>Aristocrates</prn>, who once outraged the virgin priestess of the goddess <prn id='Q106447518'>Hymnia</prn>, and after the grave of <prn id='Q4581536'>Aristocrates</prn> are springs called Teneiae, and about seven stades distant from the springs is a place Amilus, which once, they say, was a city. Here the road forks again, one way leading to <pl id='Q2359730'>Stymphalus</pl>, the other to <pl id='Q12885741'>Pheneus</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.13.6'><b>8.13.6</b> On the road to <pl id='Q12885741'>Pheneus</pl> you will come to a mountain. On this mountain meet the boundaries of <pl id='Q1855083'>Orchomenus</pl>, <pl id='Q12885741'>Pheneus</pl> and <pl id='Q2365548'>Caphya</pl>. Over the boundaries extends a high crag, called the Caphyatic Rock. After the boundaries of the cities I have mentioned lies a ravine, and the road to <pl id='Q12885741'>Pheneus</pl> leads through it. Just about the middle of the ravine water rises up from a spring, and at the end of the ravine is a place called <pl id='Q12878817'>Caryae</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.14.1'><b>8.14.1</b> The plain of <pl id='Q12885741'>Pheneus</pl> lies below <pl id='Q12878817'>Caryae</pl>, and they say that once the water rose on it and flooded the ancient city of <pl id='Q12885741'>Pheneus</pl>, so that even today there remain on the mountains marks up to which, it is said, the water rose. Five stades distant from <pl id='Q12878817'>Caryae</pl> is a mountain called <pl id='Q27044139'>Oryxis</pl>, and another, <pl id='Q117842465'>Mount Sciathis</pl>. Under each mountain is a chasm that receives the water from the plain. </p>
<p id='8.14.2'><b>8.14.2</b> These chasms according to the people of <pl id='Q12885741'>Pheneus</pl> are artificial, being made by <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> when he lived in <pl id='Q12885741'>Pheneus</pl> with <prn id='Q18410650'>Laonome</prn>, the mother of <prn id='Q206214'>Amphitryon</prn>, who was, it is said, the son of <prn id='Q142739'>Alcaeus</prn> by <prn id='Q18410650'>Laonome</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q26279264'>Guneus</prn>, a woman of <pl id='Q12885741'>Pheneus</pl>, and not by <prn id='Q1754201'>Lysidice</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn>. Now if <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> really migrated to <pl id='Q12885741'>Pheneus</pl>, one might believe that when expelled by <prn id='Q212087'>Eurystheus</prn> from <pl id='Q217379'>Tiryns</pl> he did not go at once to <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>, but went first to <pl id='Q12885741'>Pheneus</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.14.3'><b>8.14.3</b> <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> dug a channel through the middle of the plain of <pl id='Q12885741'>Pheneus</pl> for the river <pl id='Q7088891'>Olbius</pl>, which some <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> call, not Olbius but <pl id='Q3555039'>Aroanius</pl>. The length of the cutting is fifty stades, its depth, where it has not fallen in, is as much as thirty feet. The river, however, no longer flows along it, but it has gone back to its old bed, having left the work of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.14.4'><b>8.14.4</b> About fifty stades from the chasms made in the mountains I have mentioned is the city, founded, say the <pl id='Q12885741'>Pheneatians</pl>, by <prn id='Q106075949'>Pheneus</prn>, an aboriginal. Their acropolis is precipitous on all sides, mostly so naturally, but a few parts have been artificially strengthened, to make it more secure. On the acropolis here is a temple of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> surnamed <prn id='Q107245681'>Tritonia</prn>, but of it I found ruins only remaining. </p>
<p id='8.14.5'><b>8.14.5</b> There stands also a bronze <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, surnamed <prn id='Q20100719'>Hippios</prn>, whose image, it is said, was dedicated by <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn>. The legend is that <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn> lost his mares, traversed Greece in search of them, and on the site in the land of <prn id='Q106075949'>Pheneus</prn> where he found his mares founded a sanctuary of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, calling the goddess <prn id='Q107246803'>Heurippa</prn> [horse-finder], and also dedicated the image of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> <prn id='Q20100719'>Hippios</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.14.6'><b>8.14.6</b> When <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn> found his mares he was minded, it is said, to keep <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn> in the land of <pl id='Q12885741'>Pheneus</pl>, just as he reared his <prn id='Q830'>cows</prn>, they say, on the mainland opposite Ithaca. On the base of the image the people of <pl id='Q12885741'>Pheneus</pl> pointed out to me writing, purporting to be instructions of <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn> to those tending his mares. </p>
<p id='8.14.7'><b>8.14.7</b> The rest of the account of the people of <pl id='Q12885741'>Pheneus</pl> it will be reasonable to accept, but I cannot believe their statement that <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn> dedicated the bronze image. For men had not yet learned how to make bronze images in one piece, after the manner of those weaving a garment. Their method of working bronze statues I have already described when speaking of the image of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> Hypatos [most high] in my history of the <pl id='Q5690'>Spartans</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.14.8'><b>8.14.8</b> The first men to melt bronze and to cast images were the <pl id='Q13580795'>Samians</pl> <prn id='Q1851693'>Rhoecus</prn> the son of A2101 and <prn id='Q3286634'>Theodorus</prn> the son of Telecles1. <prn id='Q3286634'>Theodorus</prn> also made the emerald seal-stone, which <prn id='Q294840'>Polycrates</prn>, the tyrant of <pl id='Q13580795'>Samos</pl>, constantly wore, being exceedingly proud of it. </p>
<p id='8.14.9'><b>8.14.9</b> As you go down from the acropolis of <pl id='Q12885741'>Pheneus</pl> you come to a stadium, and on a hill stands a tomb of <prn id='Q738862'>Iphicles</prn>, the brother of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> and the father of <prn id='Q504076'>Iolaus</prn>. <prn id='Q504076'>Iolaus</prn>, according to the Greek account, shared most of the labours of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, but his father <prn id='Q738862'>Iphicles</prn>, in the first battle fought by <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> against the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> and <prn id='Q207663'>Augeas</prn>, was wounded by the <prn id='Q958315'>sons</prn> of <prn id='Q423424'>Actor</prn>, who were called [<prn id='Q958315'>Molionids</prn>] after their mother <prn id='Q4300425'>Moline</prn>. In a fainting condition he was carried by his relatives to <pl id='Q12885741'>Pheneus</pl>, where he was carefully nursed by <prn id='Q3646522'>Buphagus</prn>, a citizen of <pl id='Q12885741'>Pheneus</pl>, and by his wife A1841, who also buried him when he died of his wound. </p>
<p id='8.14.10'><b>8.14.10</b> They still sacrifice to <prn id='Q738862'>Iphicles</prn> as to a hero, and of the gods the people of <pl id='Q12885741'>Pheneus</pl> worship most <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn>, in whose honor they celebrate the games called Hermaea; they have also a temple of <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn>, and a stone image, made by an <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl>, <prn id='Q11955859'>Eucheir</prn> the son of <prn id='Q992267'>Eubulides</prn>. Behind the temple is the grave of <prn id='Q615912'>Myrtilus</prn>. The Greeks say that he was the son of <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn>, and that he served as charioteer to <prn id='Q847890'>Oenomaus</prn>. Whenever a man arrived to woo the daughter of <prn id='Q847890'>Oenomaus</prn>, <prn id='Q615912'>Myrtilus</prn> craftily drove on the mares, while <prn id='Q847890'>Oenomaus</prn> on the course shot down the wooer when he came near. </p>
<p id='8.14.11'><b>8.14.11</b> <prn id='Q615912'>Myrtilus</prn> himself, too, was in love with <prn id='Q328354'>Hippodameia</prn>, but his courage failing him he shrank from the competition and served <prn id='Q847890'>Oenomaus</prn> as his charioteer. At last, it is said, he proved a traitor to <prn id='Q847890'>Oenomaus</prn>, being induced thereto by an oath sworn by <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn> that he would let him be with <prn id='Q328354'>Hippodameia</prn> for one night. So when reminded of his oath <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn> threw him out of the ship. The people of <pl id='Q12885741'>Pheneus</pl> say that the body of <prn id='Q615912'>Myrtilus</prn> was cast ashore by the tide, that they took it up and buried it, and that every year they sacrifice to him by night as to a hero. </p>
<p id='8.14.12'><b>8.14.12</b> It is plain that <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn> did not make a long coasting voyage, but only sailed from the mouth of the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl> to the harbor of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>. So the <pl id='Q840427'>Myrtoan Sea</pl> is obviously not named after <prn id='Q615912'>Myrtilus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn>, as it begins at <pl id='Q173096'>Euboea</pl> and reaches the <pl id='Q34575'>Aegean</pl> by way of the uninhabited island of <pl id='Q618600'>Helene</pl>. I think that a probable account is given by the antiquarians of <pl id='Q173096'>Euboea</pl>, who say that the sea is named after a woman called <prn id='Q1956836'>Myrto</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.15.1'><b>8.15.1</b> The people of <pl id='Q12885741'>Pheneus</pl> have also a sanctuary of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>, surnamed <pl id='Q94299853'>Eleusinian</pl>, and they perform a ritual to the goddess, saying that the ceremonies at <pl id='Q94299853'>Eleusis</pl> are the same as those established among themselves. For <prn id='Q16330354'>Naus</prn>, they assert, came to them because of an oracle from <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>, being a grandson of <prn id='Q1125049'>Eumolpus</prn>. Beside the sanctuary of the <pl id='Q94299853'>Eleusinian</pl> has been set up PetromaYY, as it is called, consisting of two large stones fitted one to the other. </p>
<p id='8.15.2'><b>8.15.2</b> When every other year they celebrate what they call the Greater Rites, they open these stones. They take from out them writings that refer to the rites, read them in the hearing of the initiated, and return them on the same night. Most <pl id='Q12885741'>Pheneatians</pl>, too, I know, take an oath by the PetromaYY in the most important affairs. </p>
<p id='8.15.3'><b>8.15.3</b> On top of it is a sphere, with a mask inside of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> Cidaria. This mask is put on by the priest at the so-called Greater Rites, who for some reason or other beats with rods the Folk Underground (Hypochthonioi). The <pl id='Q12885741'>Pheneatians</pl> have a story that even before <prn id='Q16330354'>Naus</prn> arrived, the wanderings of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> brought her to their city also. To those <pl id='Q12885741'>Pheneatians</pl> who received her with hospitality into their homes the goddess gave all sorts of pulses but not beans. </p>
<p id='8.15.4'><b>8.15.4</b> There is a sacred story to explain why the bean in their eyes is an impure kind of pulse. Those who, the <pl id='Q12885741'>Pheneatians</pl> say, gave the goddess a welcome, Trisaules and Damithales, had a temple of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> ThesmiaYY (Law-goddess) built under Mount <pl id='Q1232572'>Cyllene</pl>, and they established for her rites also, which they celebrate even to this day. This temple of the goddess ThesmiaYY is just about fifteen stades away from the city. </p>
<p id='8.15.5'><b>8.15.5</b> As you go from <pl id='Q12885741'>Pheneus</pl> to <pl id='Q2068130'>Pellene</pl> and <pl id='Q18363976'>Aegeira</pl>, an <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaean</pl> city, after about fifteen stades you come to a temple of <prn id='Q107189402'>Pythian</prn> <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>. I found there only its ruins, which include a large altar of white marble. Here even now the <pl id='Q12885741'>Pheneatians</pl> still sacrifice to <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> and <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, and they say that the sanctuary was made by <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> after capturing <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>. Here also are tombs of heroes, those who joined the campaign of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> against <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> and lost their lives in the fighting. </p>
<p id='8.15.6'><b>8.15.6</b> They are <prn id='Q117836164'>Telamon</prn>, buried quite near the river <pl id='Q3555039'>Aroanius</pl>, a little farther away than is the sanctuary of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, and <prn id='Q107622387'>Chalcodon</prn>, not far from the spring called Oenoe. Nobody could admit that there fell in this battle the <prn id='Q2640841'>Chalcodon</prn> who was the father of the <prn id='Q1328257'>Elephenor</prn> who led the <pl id='Q173096'>Euboeans</pl> to <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl>, and the <prn id='Q331327'>Telamon</prn> who was the father of <prn id='Q172725'>Ajax</prn> and <prn id='Q878184'>Teucer</prn>. For how could <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> have been helped in his task by a <prn id='Q2640841'>Chalcodon</prn> who, according to trustworthy tradition, had before this been killed in <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> by <prn id='Q206214'>Amphitryon</prn>? </p>
<p id='8.15.7'><b>8.15.7</b> And how would <prn id='Q878184'>Teucer</prn> have founded the city of <pl id='Q767089'>Salamis</pl> in <pl id='Q644636'>Cyprus</pl> if nobody had expelled him from his native city after his return from <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl>? And who else would have driven him out except <prn id='Q331327'>Telamon</prn>? So it is plain that those who helped <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> in his campaign against <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> were not the <prn id='Q2640841'>Chalcodon</prn> of <pl id='Q173096'>Euboea</pl> and the <prn id='Q331327'>Telamon</prn> of <pl id='Q191082'>Aegina</pl>. It is, and always has been, not unknown that undistinguished persons have had the same names as distinguished heroes. </p>
<p id='8.15.8'><b>8.15.8</b> The borders of <pl id='Q12885741'>Pheneus</pl> and <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaia</pl> meet in more places than one; for towards <pl id='Q2068130'>Pellene</pl> the boundary is the river called Porinas, and towards the territory of <pl id='Q18363976'>Aegeira</pl> the “road to <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>.” Within the territory of the <pl id='Q12885741'>Pheneatians</pl> themselves, shortly after passing the sanctuary of the <prn id='Q107189402'>Pythian</prn> <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> you will be on the road that leads to Mount <pl id='Q101048087'>Crathis</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.15.9'><b>8.15.9</b> On this mountain is the source of the river <pl id='Q6436394'>Crathis</pl>, which flows into the sea by the side of <pl id='Q16737279'>Aegae</pl>, now a deserted spot, though in earlier days it was a city of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>. After this <pl id='Q6436394'>Crathis</pl> is named the <pl id='Q660005'>river</pl> in <pl id='Q994847'>Bruttium</pl> in <pl id='Q913582'>Italy</pl>. On Mount <pl id='Q101048087'>Crathis</pl> is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> <prn id='Q107305496'>Pyronia</prn> (Fire-goddess), and in more ancient days the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> used to bring from this goddess fire for their <pl id='Q1236078'>Lernaean</pl> ceremonies. </p>
<p id='8.16.1'><b>8.16.1</b> Going east from <pl id='Q12885741'>Pheneus</pl> you come to a mountain peak called Geronteium and a road by it. This mountain is the boundary between the territories of <pl id='Q12885741'>Pheneus</pl> and <pl id='Q2359730'>Stymphalus</pl>. On the left of it, as you travel through the land of <pl id='Q12885741'>Pheneus</pl>, are mountains of the <pl id='Q12885741'>Pheneatians</pl> called <pl id='Q15119978'>Tricrena</pl> (Three Springs), and here are three springs. In them, says the legend, <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> was washed after birth by the nymphs of the mountain, and for this reason they are considered sacred to <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.16.2'><b>8.16.2</b> Not far from <pl id='Q15119978'>Tricrena</pl> is another mountain called Sepia, where they say that <prn id='Q406441'>Aepytus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q1325009'>Elatus</prn>, was killed by the <prn id='Q2102'>snake</prn>, and they also made his grave on the spot, for they could not carry the body away. These <prn id='Q2102'>snakes</prn> are still to be found, the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> say, on the mountain, even at the present day; not many, however, for they are very scarce. The reason is that, as for the greater part of the year snow falls on the mountain, the <prn id='Q2102'>snakes</prn> die that are cut off by the snow from their holes, while should any make good their escape to the holes, nevertheless some of them are killed by the snow, as the frost penetrates even into the very holes themselves. </p>
<p id='8.16.3'><b>8.16.3</b> The grave of <prn id='Q406441'>Aepytus</prn> I was especially anxious to see, because <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> in his verses about the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> makes mention of the tomb of <prn id='Q406441'>Aepytus</prn>. It is a mound of earth of no great size, surrounded by a circular base of stone. <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> naturally was bound to admire it, as he had never seen a more noteworthy tomb, just as he compares the dance worked by <prn id='Q44384'>Hephaestus</prn> on the shield of <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn> to a dance made by <prn id='Q134756'>Daedalus</prn>, because he had never seen more clever workmanship. </p>
<p id='8.16.4'><b>8.16.4</b> I know many wonderful graves, and will mention two of them, the one at <pl id='Q5843680'>Halicarnassus</pl> and one in the land of the <prn id='Q7325'>Hebrews</prn>. The <pl id='Q45368'>one</pl> at <pl id='Q5843680'>Halicarnassus</pl> was made for <prn id='Q296857'>Mausolus</prn>, king of the city, and it is of such vast size, and so notable for all its ornament, that the Romans in their great admiration of it call remarkable tombs in their country “Mausolea.” </p>
<p id='8.16.5'><b>8.16.5</b> The <prn id='Q7325'>Hebrews</prn> have a grave, that of HelenaYY, a native woman, in the city of <pl id='Q1218'>Jerusalem</pl>, which the Roman Emperor razed to the ground. There is a contrivance in the grave whereby the door, which like all the grave is of stone, does not open until the year brings back the same day and the same hour. Then the mechanism, unaided, opens the door, which, after a short interval, shuts itself. This happens at that time, but should you at any other try to open the door you cannot do so; force will not open it, but only break it down. </p>
<p id='8.17.1'><b>8.17.1</b> After the grave of <prn id='Q406441'>Aepytus</prn> you come to the highest mountain in <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl>, <pl id='Q1232572'>Cyllene</pl>, on the top of which is a dilapidated temple of <prn id='Q59208751'>Cyllenian</prn> <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn>. It is clear that <prn id='Q59200471'>Cyllen</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q1325009'>Elatus</prn>, gave the mountain its name and the god his surname. </p>
<p id='8.17.2'><b>8.17.2</b> In days of old, men made wooden images, so far as I have been able to discover, from the following trees: ebony, cypress, cedar, oak, yew, lotus. But the image of <prn id='Q59208751'>Cyllenian</prn> <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> is made of none of these, but of juniper wood. Its height, I conjecture, is about eight feet. </p>
<p id='8.17.3'><b>8.17.3</b> <pl id='Q1232572'>Cyllene</pl> can show also the following marvel. On it the blackbirds are entirely white. The birds so called by the <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotians</pl> are a somewhat different breed, which does not sing. <prn id='Q2092297'>Eagles</prn> called swan-eagles, very like to swans for whiteness, I am acquainted with, as I have seen them on Mount <pl id='Q532698'>Sipylus</pl> round the lake called the Lake of <prn id='Q182101'>Tantalus</prn>. White wild <prn id='Q58697'>boars</prn> and Thracian white bears have been known to be acquired by private individuals. </p>
<p id='8.17.4'><b>8.17.4</b> White hares are bred in <pl id='Q2370577'>Libya</pl>, and white deer I have seen in <pl id='Q18287233'>Rome</pl> to my great astonishment, though it never occurred to me to ask from what continent or island they had been brought. I have made these few remarks concerning the blackbirds in <pl id='Q1232572'>Cyllene</pl> that nobody may disbelieve what has been said about their color. </p>
<p id='8.17.5'><b>8.17.5</b> Adjoining <pl id='Q1232572'>Cyllene</pl> is another mountain, <pl id='Q25017940'>Chelydorea</pl>, where <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> is said to have found a tortoise, taken the shell from the beast, and to have made therefrom a harp. Here is the boundary between <pl id='Q12885741'>Pheneus</pl> and <pl id='Q2068130'>Pellene</pl>, and the greater part of Mount <pl id='Q25017940'>Chelydorea</pl> is inhabited by the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.17.6'><b>8.17.6</b> As you go from <pl id='Q12885741'>Pheneus</pl> to the west, the left road leads to the city <pl id='Q2537130'>Cleitor</pl>, while on the right is the road to <pl id='Q7049180'>Nonacris</pl> and the water of the <pl id='Q542758'>Styx</pl>. Of old <pl id='Q7049180'>Nonacris</pl> was a town of the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> that was named after the wife of <prn id='Q501667'>Lycaon</prn>. When I visited it, it was in ruins, and most of these were hidden. Not far from the ruins is a high cliff; I know of none other that rises to so great a height. A water trickles down the cliff, called by the Greeks the water of the <pl id='Q542758'>Styx</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.18.1'><b>8.18.1</b> <prn id='Q44233'>Hesiod</prn> in the <prn id='Q156498'>Theogony</prn> — for there are some who assign this hexameter poem to <prn id='Q44233'>Hesiod</prn> — speaks of <pl id='Q542758'>Styx</pl> as the daughter of <prn id='Q161419'>Ocean</prn> and the wife of <prn id='Q457294'>Pallas</prn>. Men say that <prn id='Q647496'>Linus</prn> too gives a like account in his verses, though when I read these they struck me as altogether spurious. </p>
<p id='8.18.2'><b>8.18.2</b> <prn id='Q319406'>Epimenides</prn> of <pl id='Q4752820'>Crete</pl>, also, represented <pl id='Q542758'>Styx</pl> as the daughter of <prn id='Q161419'>Ocean</prn>, not, however, as the wife of <prn id='Q457294'>Pallas</prn>, but as bearing <prn id='Q185670'>Echidna</prn> to <prn id='Q47501478'>Peiras</prn>, whoever <prn id='Q47501478'>Peiras</prn> may be. But it is <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> who introduces most frequently the name of <pl id='Q542758'>Styx</pl> into his poetry. In the oath of <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> he says: “Witness now to this be <prn id='Q93172'>Earth</prn>, and broad Heaven above, And the water of <pl id='Q542758'>Styx</pl> down-flowing.” These verses suggest that the poet had seen the water of the <pl id='Q542758'>Styx</pl> trickling down. Again in the list of those who came with <prn id='Q26279264'>Guneus</prn> he makes the river <pl id='Q687260'>Titaresius</pl> receive its water from the <pl id='Q542758'>Styx</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.18.3'><b>8.18.3</b> He also represents the <pl id='Q542758'>Styx</pl> as a river in <pl id='Q1521549'>Hades</pl>, and <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> says that <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> does not remember that because of her he kept <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> safe throughout the labours imposed by <prn id='Q212087'>Eurystheus</prn>. “For if I had known this in my shrewd heart When he sent him to <pl id='Q1521549'>Hades</pl> the gate-keeper, To fetch out of <prn id='Q131122'>Erebus</prn> the <prn id='Q83496'>hound</prn> of hateful Hades</PRN>, He would never have escaped the sheer streams of the river <pl id='Q542758'>Styx</pl>.” </p>
<p id='8.18.4'><b>8.18.4</b> The water trickling down the cliff by the side of <pl id='Q7049180'>Nonacris</pl> falls first to a high rock, through which it passes and then descends into the river <pl id='Q6436394'>Crathis</pl>. Its water brings death to all, man and beast alike. It is said too that it once brought death even upon <prn id='Q2934'>goats</prn>, which drank of the water first; later on all the wonderful properties of the water were learnt. </p>
<p id='8.18.5'><b>8.18.5</b> For glass, crystal, murrhine vessels, other articles men make of stone, and pottery, are all broken by the water of the <pl id='Q542758'>Styx</pl>, while things of horn or of bone, with iron, bronze, lead, tin, silver and electrum, are all corroded by this water. Gold too suffers just like all the other metals, and yet gold is immune to rust, as the <pl id='Q128087'>Lesbian</pl> poetess bears witness and is shown by the metal itself. </p>
<p id='8.18.6'><b>8.18.6</b> So heaven has assigned to the most lowly things the mastery over things far more esteemed than they. For pearls are dissolved by vinegar, while diamonds, the hardest of stones, are melted by the blood of the he-<prn id='Q2934'>goat</prn>. The only thing that can resist the water of the <pl id='Q542758'>Styx</pl> is a <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn>'s hoof. When poured into it the water is retained, and does not break up the hoof. Whether <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn>, met his end by this poison I do not know for certain, but I do know that there is a story to this effect. </p>
<p id='8.18.7'><b>8.18.7</b> Above <pl id='Q7049180'>Nonacris</pl> are the <pl id='Q630782'>Aroanian</pl> Mountains, in which is a cave. To this cave, legend says, the <prn id='Q11827646'>daughters</prn> of <prn id='Q644604'>Proetus</prn> fled when struck with madness; <prn id='Q602258'>Melampus</prn> by secret sacrifices and purifications brought them down to a place called <pl id='Q1572206'>Lusi</pl>. Most of the <pl id='Q630782'>Aroanian</pl> mountain belongs to <pl id='Q12885741'>Pheneus</pl>, but <pl id='Q1572206'>Lusi</pl> is within the borders of <pl id='Q2537130'>Cleitor</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.18.8'><b>8.18.8</b> They say that <pl id='Q1572206'>Lusi</pl> was once a city, and <prn id='Q106033517'>Agesilas</prn> was proclaimed as a man of <pl id='Q1572206'>Lusi</pl> when victor in the horse-race at the eleventh <pl id='Q682558'>Pythian</pl> festival held by the <prn id='Q182875'>Amphictyons</prn>; but when I was there not even ruins of <pl id='Q1572206'>Lusi</pl> remained. Well, the <prn id='Q11827646'>daughters</prn> of <prn id='Q644604'>Proetus</prn> were brought down by <prn id='Q602258'>Melampus</prn> to <pl id='Q1572206'>Lusi</pl>, and healed of their madness in a <pl id='Q111086688'>sanctuary</pl> of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>. Wherefore this <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> is called <prn id='Q107243117'>Hemerasia</prn> (She who soothes) by the <pl id='Q2537130'>Cleitorians</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.19.1'><b>8.19.1</b> There is a clan of the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl>, called the <pl id='Q5199870'>Cynaetheans</pl>, the same folk who dedicated the image of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> with a thunderbolt in either hand. These <pl id='Q5199870'>Cynaetheans</pl> live more than forty stades from . . . and in their marketplace have been made altars of the gods and a statue of the Emperor <prn id='Q1427'>Hadrian</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.19.2'><b>8.19.2</b> The most notable things here include a sanctuary of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>, to whom they hold a feast in the winter, at which men smeared with grease take up from a herd of <prn id='Q830'>cattle</prn> a <prn id='Q693690'>bull</prn>, whichever one the god suggest to them, and carry it to the sanctuary. This is the manner of their sacrifice. Here there is a spring of cold water, about two stades away from the city, and above it grows a plane-tree. </p>
<p id='8.19.3'><b>8.19.3</b> If a rabid <prn id='Q144'>dog</prn> turn a man mad, or wound or otherwise endanger him, to drink this water is a cure. For this reason they call the spring Alyssus (Curer of madness). So it would appear that the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> have in the water near <pl id='Q12885741'>Pheneus</pl>, called the <pl id='Q542758'>Styx</pl>, a thing made to be a mischief to man, while the spring among the <pl id='Q5199870'>Cynaetheans</pl> is a boon to make up for the bane in the other place. </p>
<p id='8.19.4'><b>8.19.4</b> One of the roads from <pl id='Q12885741'>Pheneus</pl>, which go westward, remains, the one on the left.

I heard that the water making a lake in the territory of <pl id='Q12885741'>Pheneus</pl>, descending into the chasms in the mountains, rises here and forms the source of the <pl id='Q1462727'>Ladon</pl>, but I cannot say for certain whether this is true or not. The <pl id='Q1462727'>Ladon</pl> is the most lovely river in Greece, and is also famous for the legend of <prn id='Q194015'>Daphne</prn> that the poets tell. </p>
<p id='8.20.2'><b>8.20.2</b> I pass over the story current among the Syrians who live on the river <pl id='Q188871'>Orontes</pl>, and give the account of the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> and <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl>. <prn id='Q847890'>Oenomaus</prn>, prince of <pl id='Q922329'>Pisa</pl>, had a son <prn id='Q165589'>Leucippus</prn>. <prn id='Q165589'>Leucippus</prn> fell in love with <prn id='Q194015'>Daphne</prn>, but despaired of winning her to be his wife by an open courtship, as she avoided all the male sex. The following trick occurred to him by which to get her. <prn id='Q165589'>Leucippus</prn> was growing his hair long for the river <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.20.3'><b>8.20.3</b> Braiding his hair as though he were a maiden, and putting on woman's clothes, he came to <prn id='Q194015'>Daphne</prn> and said that he was a daughter of <prn id='Q847890'>Oenomaus</prn>, and would like to share her hunting. As he was thought to be a maiden, surpassed the other maidens in nobility of birth and skill in hunting, and was besides most assiduous in his attentions, he drew <prn id='Q194015'>Daphne</prn> into a deep friendship. </p>
<p id='8.20.4'><b>8.20.4</b> The poets who sing of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>'s love for <prn id='Q194015'>Daphne</prn> make an addition to the tale; that <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> became jealous of <prn id='Q165589'>Leucippus</prn> because of his success in his love. Forthwith <prn id='Q194015'>Daphne</prn> and the other maidens conceived a longing to swim in the <pl id='Q1462727'>Ladon</pl>, and stripped <prn id='Q165589'>Leucippus</prn> in spite of his reluctance. Then, seeing that he was no maid, they killed him with their javelins and daggers. </p>
<p id='8.21.1'><b>8.21.1</b> Such is the tale. From the source of the <pl id='Q1462727'>Ladon</pl>, <pl id='Q2537130'>Cleitor</pl> is sixty stades away, and the road from the source of the <pl id='Q1462727'>Ladon</pl> is a narrow gorge alongside the river <pl id='Q3555039'>Aroanius</pl>. Near the city you will cross the river called the <pl id='Q26985005'>Cleitor</pl>. The <pl id='Q26985005'>Cleitor</pl> flows into the <pl id='Q3555039'>Aroanius</pl>, at a point not more than seven stades from the city. </p>
<p id='8.21.2'><b>8.21.2</b> Among the fish in the <pl id='Q3555039'>Aroanius</pl> is one called the dappled fish. These dappled fish, it is said, utter a cry like that of the thrush. I have seen fish that have been caught, but I never heard their cry, though I waited by the river even until sunset, at which time the fish were said to cry most. </p>
<p id='8.21.3'><b>8.21.3</b> <pl id='Q2537130'>Cleitor</pl> got its name from the son of <prn id='Q793560'>Azan</prn>, and is situated on a level spot surrounded by low hills. The most celebrated sanctuaries of the <pl id='Q2537130'>Cleitorians</pl> are those of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>, <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> and, thirdly, <prn id='Q94066'>Eileithyia</prn> . . . to be, and gave no number for them. The <pl id='Q18927'>Lycian</pl> <prn id='Q978308'>Olen</prn>, an earlier poet, who composed for the <pl id='Q173148'>Delians</pl>, among other hymns, one to <prn id='Q94066'>Eileithyia</prn>, styles her <prn id='Q107246852'>Eulinus</prn> (“the clever spinner”), clearly identifying her with fate, and makes her older than <prn id='Q44204'>Cronus</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.21.4'><b>8.21.4</b> <pl id='Q2537130'>Cleitor</pl> has also, at a distance of about four stades from the city, a sanctuary of the <prn id='Q190103'>Dioscuri</prn>, under the name of the <prn id='Q940138'>Great Gods</prn>. There are also images of them in bronze. There is also built upon a mountain-top, thirty stades away from the city, a temple of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> <prn id='Q58657228'>Coria</prn> with an image of the goddess. </p>
<p id='8.22.1'><b>8.22.1</b> My narrative returns to <pl id='Q2359730'>Stymphalus</pl> and to Geronteium, as it is called, the boundary between <pl id='Q2359730'>Stymphalus</pl> and <pl id='Q12885741'>Pheneus</pl>. The <pl id='Q2359730'>Stymphalians</pl> are no longer included among the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl>, but are numbered with the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl> League, which they joined of their own accord. That they are by race <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> is testified by the verses of <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>, and <prn id='Q775176'>Stymphalus</prn> their founder was a grandson of <prn id='Q606422'>Arcas</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q203673'>Callisto</prn>. It is said that it was originally founded on another site, and not on that of the modern city. </p>
<p id='8.22.2'><b>8.22.2</b> The story has it that in the old <pl id='Q2359730'>Stymphalus</pl> dwelt <prn id='Q3546799'>Temenus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q1636827'>Pelasgus</prn>, and that <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> was reared by this <prn id='Q3546799'>Temenus</prn>, who himself established three sanctuaries for the goddess, and gave her three surnames when she was still a maiden, Girl; when married to <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> he called her <prn id='Q106880607'>Teleia</prn> [Grown-up]; when for some cause or other she quarrelled with <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> and came back to <pl id='Q2359730'>Stymphalus</pl>, <prn id='Q3546799'>Temenus</prn> named her Widow. This is the account which, to my own knowledge, the <pl id='Q2359730'>Stymphalians</pl> give of the goddess. </p>
<p id='8.22.3'><b>8.22.3</b> The modern city contains none of these sanctuaries, but I found the following notable things. In the <pl id='Q2359730'>Stymphalian</pl> territory is a spring, from which the emperor <pl id='Q56295608'>Hadrian brought water</pl> to <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl>. In winter the spring makes a small lake in <pl id='Q2359730'>Stymphalus</pl>, and the river <pl id='Q2359730'>Stymphalus</pl> issues from the lake; in summer there is no lake, but the river comes straight from the spring. This river descends into a chasm in the earth, and reappearing once more in <pl id='Q12649101'>Argolis</pl> it changes its name, and is called <pl id='Q12877267'>Erasinus</pl> instead of <pl id='Q2359730'>Stymphalus</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.22.4'><b>8.22.4</b> There is a story current about the water of the <pl id='Q2359730'>Stymphalus</pl>, that at one time man-eating birds bred on it, which <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> is said to have shot down. <prn id='Q1233081'>Peisander</prn> the <pl id='Q1231539'>Kamirean</pl>, however, says that <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> did not kill the birds, but drove them away with the noise of rattles. The ArabianYY desert breeds among other wild creatures birds called <prn id='Q236429'>Stymphalian</prn>, which are quite as savage against men as <prn id='Q140'>lions</prn> or leopards. </p>
<p id='8.22.5'><b>8.22.5</b> These fly against those who come to hunt them, wounding and killing them with their beaks. All armour of bronze or iron that men wear is pierced by the birds; but if they weave a garment of thick cork, the beaks of the <prn id='Q236429'>Stymphalian</prn> birds are caught in the cork garment, just as the wings of small birds stick in bird-lime. These birds are of the size of a crane, and are like the ibis, but their beaks are more powerful, and not crooked like that of the ibis. </p>
<p id='8.22.6'><b>8.22.6</b> Whether the modern ArabianYY birds with the same name as the old <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadian</pl> birds are also of the same breed, I do not know. But if there have been from all time <prn id='Q236429'>Stymphalian</prn> birds, just as there have been hawks and <prn id='Q2092297'>eagles</prn>, I should call these birds of ArabianYY origin, and a section of them might have flown on some occasion to <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl> and reached <pl id='Q2359730'>Stymphalus</pl>. Originally they would be called by the <pl id='Q57751375'>Arabians</pl>, not <prn id='Q236429'>Stymphalian</prn>, but by another name. But the fame of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, and the superiority of the Greek over the foreigner, has resulted in the birds of the ArabianYY desert being called <pl id='Q2359730'>Stymphalian</pl> even in modern times. </p>
<p id='8.22.7'><b>8.22.7</b> In <pl id='Q2359730'>Stymphalus</pl> there is also an old sanctuary of <pl id='Q2359730'>Stymphalian</pl> <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, the image being a xoanon, for the most part gilded. Near the roof of the temple have been carved, among other things, the <prn id='Q236429'>Stymphalian</prn> birds. Now it was difficult to discern clearly whether the carving was in wood or in gypsum, but such evidence as I had led me to conclude that it was not of gypsum but of wood. There are here also maidens of white marble, with the legs of birds, and they stand behind the temple. </p>
<p id='8.22.8'><b>8.22.8</b> Even in our own day the following miracle is said to have occurred. The festival of <pl id='Q2359730'>Stymphalian</pl> <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> at <pl id='Q2359730'>Stymphalus</pl> was carelessly celebrated, and its established ritual in great part transgressed. Now a log fell into the mouth of the chasm into which the river descends, and so prevented the water from draining away, and (so it is said) the plain became a lake for a distance of four hundred stades. </p>
<p id='8.22.9'><b>8.22.9</b> They also say that a hunter chased a deer, which fled and plunged into the marsh, followed by the hunter, who, in the excitement of the hunt, swam after the deer. So the chasm swallowed up both the deer and her pursuer. They are said to have been followed by the water of the river, so that by the next day the whole of the water was dried up that flooded the <pl id='Q2359730'>Stymphalian</pl> plain. Hereafter they put greater zeal into the festival in honor of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.23.1'><b>8.23.1</b> After <pl id='Q2359730'>Stymphalus</pl> comes <pl id='Q3609405'>Alea</pl>, which too belongs to the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl> federation, and its citizens point to <prn id='Q1536527'>Aleus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q3606201'>Apheidas</prn>, as their founder. The sanctuaries of the gods here are those of <pl id='Q43018'>Ephesian</pl> <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> and <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> <prn id='Q1857789'>Alea</prn>, and there is a temple of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> with an image. In honor of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> they celebrate every other year a festival called <prn id='Q12884515'>Sciereia</prn>, and at this festival, in obedience to a response from <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>, women are flogged, just as the <pl id='Q5690'>Spartan</pl> lads are flogged at the image of the <pl id='Q550466'>Orthian</pl> goddess. </p>
<p id='8.23.2'><b>8.23.2</b> In my account of <pl id='Q1855083'>Orchomenus</pl>, I explained how the straight road runs at first beside the gully, and afterwards to the left of the flood water. On the plain of <pl id='Q2365548'>Caphyae</pl> has been made a dyke of earth, which prevents the water from the <pl id='Q1855083'>Orchomenian</pl> territory from doing harm to the tilled land of <pl id='Q2365548'>Caphyae</pl>. Inside the dyke flows along another stream, in size big enough to be called a river, and descending into a chasm of the earth it rises again at <pl id='Q6967679'>Nasi</pl>, as it is called. The place where it reappears is called Rheunus; the stream having risen here, hereafter the water forms an ever-flowing river, the <pl id='Q24888109'>Tragos</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.23.3'><b>8.23.3</b> The name of the city is clearly derived from <prn id='Q1509662'>Cepheus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q1536527'>Aleus</prn>, but its form in the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadian</pl> dialect, <pl id='Q2365548'>Caphyae</pl>, is the one that has survived. The inhabitants say that originally they were from <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl>, but on being expelled from <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> by <prn id='Q191725'>Aegeus</prn> they fled to <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl>, threw themselves on the mercy of <prn id='Q1509662'>Cepheus</prn>, and found a home in the country. The town is on the border of the plain at the foot of some inconsiderable mountains. The <pl id='Q2365548'>Caphyatans</pl> have a sanctuary of the god <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, and one of the goddess <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, surnamed <prn id='Q58419765'>Cnacalesia</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.23.4'><b>8.23.4</b> They have also a mountain called Cnacalus, where every year they celebrate mysteries in honor of their <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>. A little beyond the city is a spring, and by the spring grows a large and beautiful plane tree. They call it MenelaisYY, saying that the plane was planted by the spring by <prn id='Q171839'>Menelaus</prn>, who came to the spot when he was collecting his army against <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl>. Today they give the name MenelaisYY to the spring as well as to the plane. </p>
<p id='8.23.5'><b>8.23.5</b> If I am to base my calculations on the accounts of the Greeks in fixing the relative ages of such trees as are still preserved and flourish, the oldest of them is the vitex growing in the <pl id='Q841207'>Samian sanctuary</pl> of <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn>, after which come the oak in <pl id='Q382317'>Dodona</pl>, the olive on the <pl id='Q131013'>Acropolis</pl> and the olive in <pl id='Q106802906'>Delos</pl>. The third place in respect of age the Syrians would assign to the bay-tree they have in their country. Of the others this plane-tree is the oldest. </p>
<p id='8.23.6'><b>8.23.6</b> About a stade distant from <pl id='Q2365548'>Caphyae</pl> is a place called Condylea, where there are a grove and a temple of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> called of old Condyleatis. They say that the name of the goddess was changed for the following reason. Some children, the number of whom is not recorded, while playing about the sanctuary found a rope, and tying it round the neck of the image said that <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> was being strangled. </p>
<p id='8.23.7'><b>8.23.7</b> The <pl id='Q2365548'>Caphyans</pl>, detecting what the children had done, stoned them to death. When they had done this, a malady befell their women, whose babies were stillborn, until the <prn id='Q220344'>Pythian priestess</prn> bade them bury the children, and sacrifice to them every year as sacrifice is made to heroes, because they had been wrongly put to death. The <pl id='Q2365548'>Caphyans</pl> still obey this oracle, and call the goddess at Condyleae, as they say the oracle also bade them, the Strangled Lady from that day to this. </p>
<p id='8.23.8'><b>8.23.8</b> Going up about seven stades from <pl id='Q2365548'>Caphyae</pl> you will go down to what is called <pl id='Q6967679'>Nasi</pl>. Fifty stades farther on is the <pl id='Q1462727'>Ladon</pl>. You will then cross the river and reach an oak forest called <prn id='Q16330917'>Soron</prn>, passing through Argeathae, Lycuntes, as it is called, and <pl id='Q60791560'>Scotane</pl>. Now the road to <pl id='Q1187304'>Psophis</pl> passes by way of Soron, </p>
<p id='8.23.9'><b>8.23.9</b> which, like other <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadian</pl> oak forests, breeds the following beasts wild <prn id='Q58697'>boars</prn>, bears, and tortoises of vast size. One could of the last make harps not inferior to those made from the <pl id='Q17055962'>Indian</pl> tortoise. At the end of <prn id='Q16330917'>Soron</prn> are the ruins of the village <pl id='Q26958616'>Paos</pl>, and a little farther what is called <pl id='Q60791679'>Seirae</pl>; this <pl id='Q60791679'>Seirae</pl> forms a boundary between <pl id='Q2537130'>Cleitor</pl> and <pl id='Q1187304'>Psophis</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.24.1'><b>8.24.1</b> The founder of <pl id='Q1187304'>Psophis</pl>, according to some, was <prn id='Q107305738'>Psophis</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q107305800'>Arrhon</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q60617705'>Erymanthus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q5704171'>Aristas</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q15410382'>Parthaon</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q107305785'>Periphetes</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q2599183'>Nyctimus</prn>. Others say that <prn id='Q105975176'>Psophis</prn> was the daughter of <prn id='Q107305829'>Xanthus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q60617711'>Erymanthus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q606422'>Arcas</prn>. Such are the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadian</pl> traditions concerning their kings, </p>
<p id='8.24.2'><b>8.24.2</b> but the most accurate version is that <prn id='Q430157'>Eryx</prn>, the despot of <prn id='Q952123'>Sicania</prn>, had a daughter named <prn id='Q105975176'>Psophis</prn>, whom <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, though he had intercourse with her, refused to take to his home, but left with child in the care of his friend <prn id='Q2065138'>Lycortas</prn>, who lived at PhegiaYY, a city called ErymanthuYY before the reign of <prn id='Q2329005'>Phegeus</prn>. Having been brought up here, <prn id='Q9250158'>Echephron</prn> and <prn id='Q2112714'>Promachus</prn>, the sons of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> and the <prn id='Q952123'>Sicanian</prn> woman, changed the name of PhegiaYY to <pl id='Q1187304'>Psophis</pl>, the name of their mother. </p>
<p id='8.24.3'><b>8.24.3</b> Psophis is also the name of the <pl id='Q144880'>Zacynthian</pl> acropolis, because the first man to sail across to the island was Zacynthus, the son of <prn id='Q461212'>Dardanus</prn>, a <pl id='Q1187304'>Psophidian</pl> who became its founder. From <pl id='Q60791679'>Seirae</pl> it is thirty stades to <pl id='Q1187304'>Psophis</pl>, by the side of which runs the river <pl id='Q3555039'>Aroanius</pl>, and a little farther away the river <pl id='Q3555227'>Erymanthus</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.24.4'><b>8.24.4</b> The <pl id='Q3555227'>Erymanthus</pl> has its source in Mount <pl id='Q15148035'>Lampeia</pl>, which is said to be sacred to <prn id='Q132582'>Pan</prn>. One might regard <pl id='Q15148035'>Lampeia</pl> as a part of Mount <pl id='Q1363703'>Erymanthus</pl>. <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> says that in <pl id='Q515809'>Taygetus</pl> and <pl id='Q1363703'>Erymanthus</pl> . . . hunter . . . so . . . of <pl id='Q15148035'>Lampeia</pl>, <pl id='Q3555227'>Erymanthus</pl>, and passing through <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl>, with Mount <pl id='Q2354090'>Pholoe</pl> on the right and the district of <pl id='Q1142954'>Thelpusa</pl> on the left, flows into the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.24.5'><b>8.24.5</b> There is also a legend that <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> at the command of <prn id='Q212087'>Eurystheus</prn> hunted by the side of the <pl id='Q3555227'>Erymanthus</pl> a <prn id='Q334456'>boar</prn> that surpassed all others in size and in strength. The people of <pl id='Q243456'>Cumae</pl> among the <prn id='Q3884171'>Opici</prn> say that the <prn id='Q334456'>boar</prn>'s tusks dedicated in their sanctuary of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> are those of the <prn id='Q334456'>Erymanthian boar</prn>, but the saying is altogether improbable. </p>
<p id='8.24.6'><b>8.24.6</b> In <pl id='Q1187304'>Psophis</pl> there is a <pl id='Q110983687'>sanctuary</pl> of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> surnamed <prn id='Q1363680'>Erycine</prn>; I found only ruins of it remaining, but the people said that it was established by the sons of <prn id='Q105975176'>Psophis</prn>. Their account is probable, for in <pl id='Q4951156'>Sicily</pl> too, in the territory of <pl id='Q2275983'>Eryx</pl>, is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q1363680'>Erycine</prn>, which from the remotest times has been very holy, and quite as rich as the sanctuary in <pl id='Q53556453'>Paphos</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.24.7'><b>8.24.7</b> The hero-shrines, however, of <prn id='Q2112714'>Promachus</prn> and <prn id='Q9250158'>Echephron</prn>, the sons of <pl id='Q1187304'>Psophis</pl>, were no longer distinguished when I saw them. In <pl id='Q1187304'>Psophis</pl> is buried <prn id='Q591089'>Alcmaeon</prn> also, the son of <prn id='Q330584'>Amphiaraus</prn>, and his tomb is a building remarkable for neither its size nor its ornament. About it grow cypresses, reaching to such a height that even the mountain by <pl id='Q1187304'>Psophis</pl> was overshadowed by them. These the inhabitants will not cut down, holding them to be sacred to <prn id='Q591089'>Alcmaeon</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.24.8'><b>8.24.8</b> They are called “maidens” by the natives. <prn id='Q591089'>Alcmaeon</prn>, after killing his mother, fled from <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> and came to <pl id='Q1187304'>Psophis</pl>, which was still called PhegiaYY after <prn id='Q2329005'>Phegeus</prn>, and married <prn id='Q21548368'>Alphesiboea</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q2329005'>Phegeus</prn>. Among the presents that he naturally gave her was the necklace. While he lived among the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> his disease did not grow any better, so he had recourse to the oracle at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>. The <prn id='Q220344'>Pythian priestess</prn> informed him that the only land into which the avenging spirit of <prn id='Q1125040'>Eriphyle</prn> would not follow him was the newest land, one brought up to light by the sea after the pollution of his mother's death. </p>
<p id='8.24.9'><b>8.24.9</b> On discovering the alluvial deposit of the <pl id='Q203923'>Achelous</pl> he settled there, and took to wife <prn id='Q1722503'>Callirhoe</prn>, said by the <pl id='Q416070'>Acarnanians</pl> to have been the daughter of <prn id='Q391379'>Achelous</prn>. He had two sons, <prn id='Q221925'>Acarnan</prn> and <prn id='Q981302'>Amphoterus</prn>; after this <prn id='Q221925'>Acarnan</prn> were called by their present name (so the story runs) the dwellers in this part of the mainland, who previously were called <prn id='Q247617'>Curetes</prn>. Senseless passions shipwreck many men, and even more women. </p>
<p id='8.24.10'><b>8.24.10</b> <prn id='Q1722503'>Callirhoe</prn> conceived a passion for the necklace of <prn id='Q1125040'>Eriphyle</prn>, and for this reason sent <prn id='Q591089'>Alcmaeon</prn> against his will to PhegiaYY. <prn id='Q123471077'>Temenus</prn> and <prn id='Q55996281'>Axion</prn>, the sons of <prn id='Q2329005'>Phegeus</prn>, murdered him by treachery. The sons of <prn id='Q2329005'>Phegeus</prn> are said to have dedicated the necklace to the god in <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>, and it is said that the expedition of the Greeks to <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl> took place when they were kings in the city that was still called PhegiaYY. The people of <pl id='Q1187304'>Psophis</pl> assert that the reason why they took no part in the expedition was because their princes had incurred the enmity of the leaders of the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>, who were in most cases related by blood to <prn id='Q591089'>Alcmaeon</prn>, and had joined him in his campaign against <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.24.11'><b>8.24.11</b> That the <pl id='Q767387'>Echinades</pl> islands have not been made mainland as yet by the <pl id='Q203923'>Achelous</pl> is due to the <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolian</pl> people, who have been driven from their homes and all their land has been laid waste. Accordingly, as <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolia</pl> remains untilled, the <pl id='Q203923'>Achelous</pl> does not bring as much mud upon the <pl id='Q767387'>Echinades</pl> as it otherwise would do. My reasoning is confirmed by the fact that the <pl id='Q211089'>Maeander</pl>, flowing through the land of the <pl id='Q32579'>Phrygians</pl> and <pl id='Q193214'>Carians</pl>, which is ploughed up each year, has turned to mainland in a short time the sea that once was between <pl id='Q142819'>Priene</pl> and <pl id='Q169460'>Miletus</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.24.12'><b>8.24.12</b> The people of <pl id='Q1187304'>Psophis</pl> have also by the side of the <pl id='Q3555227'>Erymanthus</pl> a temple and image of <prn id='Q88460723'>Erymanthus</prn>. The images of all rivers except the <pl id='Q3392'>Nile</pl> in <pl id='Q11768'>Egypt</pl> are made of white marble; but the images of the <pl id='Q3392'>Nile</pl>, became it descends to the sea through <pl id='Q410453'>Aethiopia</pl>, they are accustomed to make of black stone. </p>
<p id='8.24.13'><b>8.24.13</b> I heard in <pl id='Q1187304'>Psophis</pl> a statement about one <prn id='Q4692869'>Aglaus</prn>, a <pl id='Q1187304'>Psophidian</pl> contemporary with <prn id='Q184462'>Croesus</prn> the <pl id='Q620765'>Lydian</pl>. The statement was that the whole of his life was happy, but I could not believe it. </p>
<p id='8.24.14'><b>8.24.14</b> The truth is that one man may receive fewer ills than his contemporaries, just as one ship may be less tossed by storms than another ship. But we shall not be able to find a man never touched by misfortune or a ship never met by an unfavorable breeze. For <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> too says in his poetry that by the side of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> is set a jar of good things, and another jar of evil things, taught by the god at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>, who once declared that <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> himself was both unhappy and blessed, being destined by birth to both states alike. </p>
<p id='8.25.1'><b>8.25.1</b> As you go from <pl id='Q1187304'>Psophis</pl> to <pl id='Q1142954'>Thelpusa</pl> you first reach on the left of the <pl id='Q1462727'>Ladon</pl> a place called Tropaea, adjoining which is a forest, <pl id='Q27068154'>Aphrodisium</pl>. Thirdly, there is ancient writing on a slab: — “The boundary between <pl id='Q1187304'>Psophis</pl> and <pl id='Q1142954'>Thelpusa</pl>.” In the <pl id='Q1142954'>Thelpusian</pl> territory is a river called Arsen (Male). Cross this and go on for about twenty-five stades, when you will arrive at the ruins of the village Caus, with a sanctuary of Causian <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>, built on the road. </p>
<p id='8.25.2'><b>8.25.2</b> <pl id='Q1142954'>Thelpusa</pl> is some forty stades distant from this sanctuary. It is said that it was named after Thelpusa, a nymph, and that she was a daughter of <prn id='Q274600'>Ladon</prn>. The <pl id='Q1462727'>Ladon</pl> rises in springs within the territory of <pl id='Q2537130'>Cleitor</pl>, as my account has already set forth. It flows first beside a place Leucasium and <pl id='Q29654248'>Mesoboa</pl>, through <pl id='Q6967679'>Nasi</pl> to Oryx, also called <pl id='Q7105324'>Halous</pl>, and from Halous it descends to <pl id='Q7709649'>Thaliades</pl> and a sanctuary of Eleusinian <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.25.3'><b>8.25.3</b> This sanctuary is on the borders of <pl id='Q1142954'>Thelpusa</pl>. In it are images, each no less than seven feet high, of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>, her daughter, and <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>, all alike of stone. After the sanctuary of the Eleusinian goddess the <pl id='Q1462727'>Ladon</pl> flows by the city <pl id='Q1142954'>Thelpusa</pl> on the left, situated on a high hill, in modern times so deserted that the agora, which is at the extremity of it, was originally, they say, right in the very middle of it. <pl id='Q1142954'>Thelpusa</pl> has a temple of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> and a sanctuary of the twelve gods; the greater part of this, I found, lay level with the ground. </p>
<p id='8.25.4'><b>8.25.4</b> After <pl id='Q1142954'>Thelpusa</pl> the <pl id='Q1462727'>Ladon</pl> descends to the sanctuary of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> in Onceium. The <pl id='Q1142954'>Thelpusians</pl> call the goddess Erinys (Fury), and with them agrees <prn id='Q577769'>Antimachus</prn> also, who wrote a poem about the expedition of the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> against <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>. His verse runs thus: “There, they say, is the seat of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> Fury.” Now <prn id='Q1654068'>Oncius</prn> was, according to tradition, a son of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, and held sway in <pl id='Q15696676'>Thelpusian</pl> territory around the place Onceium; the goddess has the surname Fury for the following reason. </p>
<p id='8.25.5'><b>8.25.5</b> When <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> was wandering in search of her daughter, she was followed, it is said, by <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, who lusted after her. So she turned, the story runs, into a mare, and grazed with the mares of <prn id='Q1654068'>Oncius</prn>; realizing that he was outwitted, <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> too changed into a stallion and enjoyed <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.25.6'><b>8.25.6</b> At first, they say, <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> was angry at what had happened, but later on she laid aside her wrath and wished to bathe in the <pl id='Q1462727'>Ladon</pl>. So the goddess has obtained two surnames, Erinys because of her avenging anger, because the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> call being wrathful “being furious,” and Bather (Lousia) because she bathed in the <pl id='Q1462727'>Ladon</pl>. The images in the temple are of wood, but their faces, hands and feet are of <pl id='Q65040323'>Parian</pl> marble. </p>
<p id='8.25.7'><b>8.25.7</b> The image of Fury holds what is called the chest, and in her right hand a torch; her height I conjecture to be nine feet. Lusia seemed to be six feet high. Those who think the image to be <prn id='Q159168'>Themis</prn> and not <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> Lusia are, I would have them know, mistaken in their opinion. <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>, they say, had by <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> a daughter, whose name they are not wont to divulge to the uninitiated, and a <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn> called <prn id='Q842435'>Areion</prn>. For this reason they say that they were the first <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> to call <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> <prn id='Q726'>Horse</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.25.8'><b>8.25.8</b> They quote verses from the <prn id='Q8275'>Iliad</prn> and from the <prn id='Q478880'>Thebaid</prn> in confirmation of their story. In the <prn id='Q8275'>Iliad</prn> there are verses about <prn id='Q842435'>Areion</prn> himself: “Not even if he drive divine <prn id='Q842435'>Areion</prn> behind, / The swift <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn> of <prn id='Q223152'>Adrastus</prn>, who was of the race of the gods.” In the <prn id='Q478880'>Thebaid</prn> it is said that <prn id='Q223152'>Adrastus</prn> fled from <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>: “Wearing wretched clothes, and with him dark-maned <prn id='Q842435'>Areion</prn>.” They will have it that the verses obscurely hint that <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> was father to <prn id='Q842435'>Areion</prn>, but <prn id='Q577769'>Antimachus</prn> says that <prn id='Q93172'>Earth</prn> was his mother: </p>
<p id='8.25.9'><b>8.25.9</b> “<prn id='Q223152'>Adrastus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q668054'>Talaus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q869665'>Cretheus</prn>, <br>The very first of the <prn id='Q190582'>Danai</prn> to drive his famous <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn>, <br>Swift <prn id='Q2991388'>Caerus</prn> and <prn id='Q842435'>Areion</prn> of <pl id='Q1142954'>Thelpusa</pl>, <br>Whom near the grove of Oncean <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> <br><prn id='Q93172'>Earth</prn> herself sent up, a marvel for mortals to see.” </p>
<p id='8.25.10'><b>8.25.10</b> But even though sprung from <prn id='Q93172'>Earth</prn> the <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn> might be of divine lineage and the color of his hair might still be dark. Legend also has it that when <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> was warring on <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> he asked Oncus for the <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn>, and was carried to battle on the back of <prn id='Q842435'>Areion</prn> when he took <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>, but afterwards the <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn> was given to <prn id='Q223152'>Adrastus</prn> by <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>. Wherefore <prn id='Q577769'>Antimachus</prn> says about <prn id='Q842435'>Areion</prn>: “<prn id='Q223152'>Adrastus</prn> was the third lord who tamed him.” </p>
<p id='8.25.11'><b>8.25.11</b> The <pl id='Q1462727'>Ladon</pl>, leaving on the left the sanctuary of Erinys, passes on the left the temple of Oncaeatian <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, and on the right a sanctuary of Boy <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>, where is the tomb of <prn id='Q105954740'>Trygon</prn>, who is said to have been the nurse of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>. For the story is that <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>, when little, was exposed in <pl id='Q1142954'>Thelpusa</pl>, but was found by <prn id='Q4826358'>Autolaus</prn>, the illegitimate son of <prn id='Q606422'>Arcas</prn>, who reared the baby, and for this reason Boy <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> . . . I thought more likely, as also I set forth in my account of <pl id='Q7698713'>Epidaurus</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.25.12'><b>8.25.12</b> There is a river Touthoa, and it falls into the <pl id='Q1462727'>Ladon</pl> at the boundary between <pl id='Q1142954'>Thelpusa</pl> and <pl id='Q3562285'>Heraea</pl>, called Plain by the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl>. Where the <pl id='Q1462727'>Ladon</pl> itself falls into the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl> is an island called the Island of <prn id='Q43365'>Crows</prn>. Those who have thought that <pl id='Q3359923'>Enispe</pl>, <prn id='Q3563487'>Stratia</prn> and <pl id='Q2148349'>Rhipe</pl>, mentioned by <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>, were once inhabited islands in the <pl id='Q1462727'>Ladon</pl>, cherish, I would tell them, a false belief. </p>
<p id='8.25.13'><b>8.25.13</b> For the <pl id='Q1462727'>Ladon</pl> could never show islands even as large as a ferry-boat. As far as beauty is concerned, it is second to no river, either in Greece or in foreign lands, but it is not big enough to carry islands on its waters, as do the <pl id='Q1653'>Danube</pl> and the <pl id='Q643'>Eridanus</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.26.1'><b>8.26.1</b> The founder of <pl id='Q3562285'>Heraea</pl> was Heraeeus the son of <prn id='Q501667'>Lycaon</prn>, and the city lies on the right of the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl>, mostly upon a gentle slope, though a part descends right to the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl>. Walks have been made along the river, separated by myrtles and other cultivated trees; the baths are there, as are also two temples to <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>. One is to the god named Polites (Citizen), the other to Auxites (Giver of Increase), and they have a building there where they celebrate their mysteries in honor of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.26.2'><b>8.26.2</b> There is also in <pl id='Q3562285'>Heraea</pl> a temple of <prn id='Q132582'>Pan</prn>, as he is native to <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl>, and of the temple of <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> I found remaining various ruins, including the pillars. Of <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadian</pl> athletes the most renowned has been <prn id='Q20493414'>Damaretus</prn> of <pl id='Q3562285'>Heraea</pl>, who was the first to win the race in armour at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.26.3'><b>8.26.3</b> As you go down to the land of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> from <pl id='Q3562285'>Heraea</pl>, at a distance of about fifteen stades from <pl id='Q3562285'>Heraea</pl> you will cross the <pl id='Q1462727'>Ladon</pl>, and from it to the <pl id='Q3555227'>Erymanthus</pl> is a journey of roughly twenty stades. The boundary between <pl id='Q3562285'>Heraea</pl> and the land of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> is according to the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> the <pl id='Q3555227'>Erymanthus</pl>, but the people of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> say that the grave of <prn id='Q45098'>Coroebus</prn> bounds their territory. </p>
<p id='8.26.4'><b>8.26.4</b> But when the <prn id='Q188468'>Olympic games</prn>, after not being held for a long period, were revived by <prn id='Q2298655'>Iphitus</prn>, and the <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> festival was again held, the only prizes offered were for running, and <prn id='Q45098'>Coroebus</prn> won. On the tomb is an inscription that <prn id='Q45098'>Coroebus</prn> was the first man to win at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>, and that his grave was made at the end of <pl id='Q6536845'>Elean</pl> territory. </p>
<p id='8.26.5'><b>8.26.5</b> There is a town, <pl id='Q38281053'>Aliphera</pl>, of no great size, for it was abandoned by many of its inhabitants at the union of the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> into <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl>. As you go to this town from <pl id='Q3562285'>Heraea</pl> you will cross the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl>, and after going over a plain of just about ten stades you will reach a mountain, and ascending across the mountain for some thirty stades more you will come to the town. </p>
<p id='8.26.6'><b>8.26.6</b> The city of <pl id='Q38281053'>Aliphera</pl> has received its name from Alipherus, the son of <prn id='Q501667'>Lycaon</prn>, and there are sanctuaries here of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> and <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>; the latter they worship more than any other god, saying that she was born and bred among them. They also set up an altar of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> Lecheates (In child-bed), because here he gave birth to <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>. There is a stream they call Tritonis, adopting the story about the river A2039. </p>
<p id='8.26.7'><b>8.26.7</b> The <pl id='Q38279559'>image</pl> of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> is made of bronze, the work of <prn id='Q11925678'>Hypatodorus</prn>, worth seeing for its size and workmanship. They keep a general festival in honor of some god or other; I think in honor of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>. At this festival they sacrifice first to Myagros (Fly-catcher), praying to the hero over the victims and calling upon the Myagros When they have done this the flies trouble them no longer. </p>

<p id='8.27.1'><b>8.27.1</b> <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl> is the youngest city, not of <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl> only, but of Greece, with the exception of those whose inhabitants have been removed by the accident of the Roman domination. The <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> united into it to gain strength, realizing that the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> also were in earlier times in almost daily danger of being subjected by war to the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, but when they had increased the population of <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> by reducing <pl id='Q217379'>Tiryns</pl>, <pl id='Q16575296'>Hysiae</pl>, <pl id='Q7103538'>Orneae</pl>, <pl id='Q132564'>Mycenae</pl>, <pl id='Q502897'>Midea</pl>, along with other towns of little importance in <pl id='Q12649101'>Argolis</pl>, the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> had less to fear from the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, while they were in a stronger position to deal with their vassal neighbors. </p>
<p id='8.27.2'><b>8.27.2</b> It was with this policy in view that the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> united, and the founder of the city might fairly be considered <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn> of <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>.

<p id='8.27.5'><b>8.27.5</b> The <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> for the most part obeyed the general resolution and assembled promptly at <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl>.

<p id='8.27.6'><b>8.27.6</b> while the inhabitants of <pl id='Q7835586'>Trapezus</pl> departed altogether from the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl>, such of them as were left and were not immediately massacred by the exasperated <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl>. Those who escaped with their lives sailed away to <pl id='Q621672'>Pontus</pl> and were welcomed by the citizens of <pl id='Q7835586'>Trapezus</pl> on the <pl id='Q621672'>Euxine</pl> as their kindred, as they bore their name and came from their mother-city. The <pl id='Q1878714'>Lycosurians</pl>, although they had disobeyed, were nevertheless spared by the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> because of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> and <prn id='Q1146978'>Despoina</prn>, in whose sanctuary they had taken refuge. </p>
<p id='8.27.7'><b>8.27.7</b> Of the other cities I have mentioned, some are altogether deserted in our time, some are held by the people of <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl> as villages, namely <pl id='Q1538431'>Gortys</pl>, <prn id='Q48781570'>Dipoenae</prn>, <pl id='Q15054733'>Theisoa</pl> near <pl id='Q1855083'>Orchomenus</pl>, <pl id='Q60790161'>Methydrium</pl>, <pl id='Q7707085'>Teuthis</pl>, Calliae, <pl id='Q5706174'>Helisson</pl>. Only one of them, <pl id='Q11939941'>Pallantium</pl>, was destined to meet with a kindlier fate even then. <pl id='Q38281053'>Aliphera</pl> has continued to be regarded as a city from the beginning to the present day. </p>
<p id='8.27.8'><b>8.27.8</b> <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl> was united into one city in the same year, but a few months later, as occurred the defeat of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> at <pl id='Q2606004'>Leuctra</pl>, when <prn id='Q108823649'>Phrasicleides was archon</prn> [371/0 BCE] at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, in the second year of the <prn id='Q57337793'>hundred and second Olympiad</prn>, when <prn id='Q17115203'>Damon</prn> of <pl id='Q602564'>Thurii</pl> was victor in the foot-race. </p>
<p id='8.27.9'><b>8.27.9</b> When the citizens of <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl> had been enrolled in the <pl id='Q11225429'>Theban</pl> alliance they had nothing to fear from the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. But when the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> became involved in what was called the Sacred War, and they were hard pressed by the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl>, who were neighbors of the <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotians</pl>, and wealthy because they had seized the sanctuary at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>, </p>
<p id='8.27.10'><b>8.27.10</b> then the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, if eagerness would have done it, would have removed bodily the <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolitans</pl> and the other <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> besides; but as the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> of the day put up a vigorous defence, while their vassal neighbors gave them wholehearted assistance, no achievement of note was accomplished by either side. But the hatred felt by the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> for the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> was not a little responsible for the rise of <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q313907'>Amyntas</prn>, and of the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonian</pl> empire, and the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> did not help the Greeks at <pl id='Q13574678'>Chaeroneia</pl> or again in the struggle in <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessaly</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.27.11'><b>8.27.11</b> After a short time a tyrant arose at <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl> in the person of <prn id='Q4893643'>Aristodemus</prn>, a <pl id='Q7623270'>Phigalian</pl> by birth and a son of Artylas, who had been adopted by Tritaeus, an influential citizen of <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl>. This <prn id='Q4893643'>Aristodemus</prn>, in spite of his being a tyrant, nevertheless won the surname of “the Good.” During his tyranny the territory of <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl> was invaded by the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> under <prn id='Q421190'>Acrotatus</prn>, the eldest of the sons of King <prn id='Q464632'>Cleomenes</prn>, whose lineage I have already traced with that of all the other <pl id='Q5690'>Spartan</pl> kings. A fierce battle took place, and after many had fallen on both sides the army of <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl> had the better of the encounter. Among the <pl id='Q5690'>Spartiates</pl> killed was <prn id='Q421184'>Acrotatus</prn>, who never succeeded to the throne of his fathers. </p>
<p id='8.27.12'><b>8.27.12</b> Some two generations after the death of <prn id='Q4893643'>Aristodemus</prn>, <prn id='Q11931923'>Lydiades</prn> became tyrant, a man of distinguished family, by nature ambitious and, as he proved later, a devoted patriot. For he came to power while still young, but on reaching years of discretion he was minded to resign voluntarily the tyranny, although by this time his power was securely established. At this time <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl> was already a member of the <prn id='Q244796'>Achaean League</prn>, and <prn id='Q11931923'>Lydiades</prn> became so famous among not only the people of <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl> but also all the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> that he rivalled the fame of <prn id='Q317331'>Aratus</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.27.13'><b>8.27.13</b> The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> with all their forces under <prn id='Q299479'>Agis</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q889042'>Eudamidas</prn>, the king of the other house, attacked <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl> with larger and stronger forces than those collected by <prn id='Q421184'>Acrotatus</prn>. They overcame in battle the men of <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl>, who came out against them, and bringing up a powerful engine against the wall they shook by it the tower in this place, and hoped on the morrow to knock it down by the engine. </p>
<p id='8.27.14'><b>8.27.14</b> But the north wind was not only to prove a help to the whole Greek nation, when it dashed the greater part of the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl> fleet on the <pl id='Q60790477'>Sepiad rocks</pl>, but it also saved <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl> from being captured. For it blew violently and continuously, and broke up the engine of <prn id='Q314364'>Agis</prn>, scattering it to utter destruction. The <prn id='Q314364'>Agis</prn> whom the north wind prevented from taking <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl> is the man from whom was taken <pl id='Q2068130'>Pellene</pl> in <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaia</pl> by the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl> under <prn id='Q317331'>Aratus</prn>, and later he met his end at <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineia</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.27.15'><b>8.27.15</b> Shortly afterwards <prn id='Q310811'>Cleomenes</prn> the son of <prn id='Q173795'>Leonidas</prn> seized <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl> during a truce. Of the <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolitans</pl> some fell at once on the night of the capture in the defence of their country, when <prn id='Q11931923'>Lydiades</prn> too met his death in he battle, fighting nobly; others, about two-thirds of those of military age along with the women and children, escaped to <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl> with <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn> the son of <prn id='Q88466293'>Craugis</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.27.16'><b>8.27.16</b> But those who were caught in the city were massacred by <prn id='Q310811'>Cleomenes</prn>, who razed it to the ground and burnt it. How the <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolitans</pl> restored their city, and their achievements on their return, will be set forth in my account of <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn>. The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> people were in no way responsible for the disaster to <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl>, because <prn id='Q310811'>Cleomenes</prn> had changed their constitution from a kingship to a tyranny. </p>
<p id='8.27.17'><b>8.27.17</b> As I have already related, the boundary between <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl> and <pl id='Q3562285'>Heraea</pl> is at the source of the river <prn id='Q15135777'>Buphagus</prn>. The river got its name, they say, from a hero called <prn id='Q3646522'>Buphagus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q106884874'>Iapetus</prn> and <prn id='Q106884789'>Thornax</prn>. This is what they call her in <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconia</pl> also. They also say that <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> shot <prn id='Q3646522'>Buphagus</prn> on Mount <pl id='Q2354090'>Pholoe</pl> because he attempted an unholy sin against her godhead. </p>
<p id='8.28.1'><b>8.28.1</b> As you go from the source of the river, you will reach first a place called Maratha, and after it <pl id='Q1538431'>Gortys</pl>, which today is a village, but of old was a city. Here there is a temple of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>, made of <pl id='Q1125206'>Pentelic</pl> marble, with the god, as a beardless youth, and an image of <prn id='Q202257'>Health</prn>. <prn id='Q309579'>Scopas</prn> was the artist. The natives also say that <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn> the son of <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn> dedicated to <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> his breastplate and spear. The breastplate and the head of the spear are still there today. </p>
<p id='8.28.2'><b>8.28.2</b> Through <pl id='Q1538431'>Gortys</pl> flows a river called by those who live around its source the <pl id='Q1872337'>Lusius</pl> (Bathing River), because <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> after his birth was bathed in it; those farther from the source call it the <pl id='Q1872337'>Gortynius</pl> after the village. The water of this <pl id='Q1872337'>Gortynius</pl> is colder than that of any other river. The <pl id='Q1653'>Danube</pl>, Rhine, <pl id='Q188940'>Hypanis</pl>, <pl id='Q40855'>Borysthenes</pl>, and all rivers the streams of which freeze in winter, as they flow through land on which there is snow the greater part of the time, while the air about them is full of frost, might in my opinion rightly be called wintry; </p>
<p id='8.28.3'><b>8.28.3</b> I call the water cold of those which flow through a land with a good climate and in summer have water refreshing to drink and to bathe in, without being painful in winter. Cold in this sense is the water of the <pl id='Q1768771'>Cydnus</pl> which passes through <pl id='Q134287'>Tarsus</pl>, and of the Melas which flows past <pl id='Q152405'>Side</pl> in <pl id='Q585250'>Pamphylia</pl>. The coldness of the Ales in <pl id='Q1142488'>Colophon</pl> has even been celebrated in the verse of elegiac poets. But the <pl id='Q1872337'>Gortynius</pl> surpasses them all in coldness, especially in the season of summer. It has its source in <pl id='Q15054733'>Theisoa</pl>, which borders on <pl id='Q60790161'>Methydrium</pl>. The place where its stream joins the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl> is called Rhaeteae. </p>
<p id='8.28.4'><b>8.28.4</b> Adjoining the land of <pl id='Q15054733'>Theisoa</pl> is a village called <pl id='Q7707085'>Teuthis</pl>, which in old days was a town. In the <prn id='Q42937'>Trojan War</prn> the inhabitants supplied a general of their own. His name according to some was <prn id='Q4453665'>Teuthis</prn>, according to others <prn id='Q16328250'>Ornytus</prn>. When the Greeks failed to secure favorable winds to take them from <pl id='Q2612265'>Aulis</pl>, but were shut in for a long time by a violent gale, <prn id='Q4453665'>Teuthis</prn> quarrelled with <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn> and was about to lead the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> under his command back home again. </p>
<p id='8.28.5'><b>8.28.5</b> Whereupon, they say, <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> in the guise of A1420;A1421;A1418;A1419, the son of <prn id='Q2027227'>Ops</prn>, tried to turn <prn id='Q4453665'>Teuthis</prn> aside from his journey home. But <prn id='Q4453665'>Teuthis</prn>, his wrath swelling within him, struck with his spear the thigh of the goddess, and actually did lead his army back from <pl id='Q2612265'>Aulis</pl>. On his return to his native land the goddess appeared to him in a vision with a wound in her thigh. After this a wasting disease fell on <pl id='Q7707085'>Teuthis</pl>, and its people, alone of the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl>, suffered from famine. </p>
<p id='8.28.6'><b>8.28.6</b> Later, oracles were delivered to them from <pl id='Q382317'>Dodona</pl>, telling them what to do to appease the goddess, and in particular they had an image of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> made with a wound in the thigh. This image I have myself seen, with its thigh swathed in a purple bandage. There are also at <pl id='Q7707085'>Teuthis</pl> sanctuaries of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> and <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.28.7'><b>8.28.7</b> These are the notable things at <pl id='Q7707085'>Teuthis</pl>. On the road from <pl id='Q1538431'>Gortys</pl> to <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl> stands the tomb of those who were killed in the fight with <prn id='Q310811'>Cleomenes</prn>. This tomb the <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolitans</pl> call ParaebasiYY (Transgression) because <prn id='Q310811'>Cleomenes</prn> broke his truce with them. Adjoining ParaebasiYY is a plain about sixty stades across. On the right of the road are ruins of a city <pl id='Q12874732'>Brenthe</pl>, and here rises a river Brentheates, which some five stades farther on falls into the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.29.1'><b>8.29.1</b> After crossing the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl> you come to what is called <pl id='Q7835586'>Trapezuntian</pl> territory and to the ruins of a city <pl id='Q7835586'>Trapezus</pl>. On the left, as you go down again from <pl id='Q7835586'>Trapezus</pl> to the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl>, there is, not far from the river, a place called <pl id='Q60791682'>Bathos</pl> (Depth), where they celebrate mysteries every other year to the <prn id='Q30025797'>Great Goddesses</prn>. Here there is a spring called <prn id='Q223134'>Olympias</prn> which, during every other year, does not flow, and near the spring rises up fire. The <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> say that the fabled battle between giants and gods took place here and not at <pl id='Q2625955'>Pallene</pl> in <pl id='Q41741'>Thrace</pl>, and at this spot sacrifices are offered to lightnings, hurricanes and thunders. </p>
<p id='8.29.2'><b>8.29.2</b> <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> does not mention giants at all in the <prn id='Q8275'>Iliad</prn>, but in the <prn id='Q35160'>Odyssey</prn> he relates how the <prn id='Q743931'>Laestrygones</prn> attacked the ships of <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn> in the likeness not of men but of giants, and he makes also the king of the <prn id='Q128693'>Phaeacians</prn> say that the <prn id='Q128693'>Phaeacians</prn> are near to the gods like the <prn id='Q128430'>Cyclopes</prn> and the race of giants. In these places then he indicates that the giants are mortal, and not of divine race, and his words in the following passage are plainer still: “Who once was king among the haughty giants; But he destroyed the infatuate folk, and was destroyed himself.” “Folk” in the poetry of <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> means the common people. </p>
<p id='8.29.3'><b>8.29.3</b> That the giants had <prn id='Q2102'>serpents</prn> for feet is an absurd tale, as many pieces of evidence show, especially the following incident. The Syrian river <pl id='Q188871'>Orontes</pl> does not flow its whole course to the sea on a level, but meets a precipitous ridge with a slope away from it. The Roman emperor wished ships to sail up the river from the sea to <pl id='Q200441'>Antioch</pl>. So with much labour and expense he dug a channel suitable for ships to sail up, and turned the course of the river into this. </p>
<p id='8.29.4'><b>8.29.4</b> But when the old bed had dried up, an earthenware coffin more than eleven cubits long was found in it, and the corpse was proportionately large, and human in all parts of its body. This corpse the god in <pl id='Q1933754'>Clarus</pl>, when the Syrians came to his oracle there, declared to be <prn id='Q106403340'>Orontes</prn>, and that he was of <pl id='Q17055962'>Indian</pl> race. If it was by warming the earth of old when it was still wet and saturated with moisture that the sun made the first men, what other land is likely to have raised men either before <pl id='Q17055962'>India</pl> or of greater size, seeing that even today it still breeds beasts monstrous in their weird appearance and monstrous in size? </p>
<p id='8.29.5'><b>8.29.5</b> Some ten stades distant from the place named <pl id='Q60791682'>Bathos</pl> is what is called <pl id='Q4867451'>Basilis</pl>. The founder of it was <prn id='Q430688'>Cypselus</prn>, who gave his daughter in marriage to <prn id='Q1788026'>Cresphontes</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q311536'>Aristomachus</prn>. Today <pl id='Q4867451'>Basilis</pl> is in ruins, among which remains a sanctuary of <pl id='Q94299853'>Eleusinian</pl> <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>. Going on from here you will cross the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl> again and reach <pl id='Q60790111'>Thocnia</pl>, which is named after <prn id='Q105974222'>Thocnus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q501667'>Lycaon</prn>, and today is altogether uninhabited. <prn id='Q105974222'>Thocnus</prn> was said to have built the city on the hill. The river Aminius, flowing by the hill, falls into the <pl id='Q15137556'>Helisson</pl>, and not far away the <pl id='Q15137556'>Helisson</pl> falls into the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.30.1'><b>8.30.1</b> This <pl id='Q15137556'>Helisson</pl>, beginning at a village of the same name — for the name of the village also is <pl id='Q5706174'>Helisson</pl> — passes through the lands of <pl id='Q1227119'>Dipaea</pl> and <pl id='Q11934312'>Lycaea</pl>, and then through <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl> itself, descending into the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl> twenty stades away from the city of <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl>. Near the city is a temple of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> Epoptes (Overseer). I found the head of the image still remaining. </p>
<p id='8.30.2'><b>8.30.2</b> The river <pl id='Q15137556'>Helisson</pl> divides <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl> just as <pl id='Q690575'>Cnidus</pl> and <pl id='Q42295059'>Mitylene</pl> are cut in two by their straits, and in the north section, on the right as one looks down the river, the townsfolk have made their agora. In it is an enclosure of stones and a sanctuary of <pl id='Q111046342'>Lycaean</pl> <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, with no entrance into it. The things inside, however, can be seen — altars of the god, two tables, two <prn id='Q2092297'>eagles</prn>, and an image of <prn id='Q132582'>Pan</prn> made of stone. </p>
<p id='8.30.3'><b>8.30.3</b> His surname is <prn id='Q106403886'>Sinoeis</prn>, and they say that <prn id='Q132582'>Pan</prn> was so surnamed after a nymph <prn id='Q106403886'>Sinoe</prn>, who with others of the nymphs nursed him on her own account. There is before this enclosure a bronze image of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> worth seeing, in height twelve feet, brought from <pl id='Q7623270'>Phigalia</pl> as a contribution to the adornment of <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.30.4'><b>8.30.4</b> The place where the image was originally set up by the <pl id='Q7623270'>Phigalians</pl> is named <pl id='Q38278862'>Bassae</pl>. The surname of the god has followed him from <pl id='Q7623270'>Phigalia</pl>, but why he received the name of <prn id='Q3463121'>Epikourios</prn> (helper) will be set forth in my account of <pl id='Q7623270'>Phigalia</pl>. On the right of the <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> is a small image of the <prn id='Q334486'>Mother of the Gods</prn>, but of the temple there remains nothing save the pillars. </p>
<p id='8.30.5'><b>8.30.5</b> Before the temple of the <prn id='Q334486'>Mother</prn> is no statue, but I found still to be seen the pedestals on which statues once stood. An inscription in elegiacs on one of the pedestals says that the statue was that of <prn id='Q106404170'>Diophanes</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q2066030'>Diaeus</prn>, the man who first united the whole <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl> into what was named the <prn id='Q244796'>Achaean League</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.30.6'><b>8.30.6</b> The portico of the marketplace, called the Philippeium, was not made by <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q313907'>Amyntas</prn>, but as a compliment to him the <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolitans</pl> gave his name to the building. Near it I found a temple of <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> Acacesius in ruins, with nothing remaining except a tortoise of stone. Adjoining this Philippeium is another portico, smaller in size, where stand the government offices of <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl>, six rooms in number. In one of them is an image of <pl id='Q43018'>Ephesian</pl> <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, and in another a bronze <prn id='Q132582'>Pan</prn>, surnamed <prn id='Q107312162'>Scoleitas</prn>, one cubit high. </p>
<p id='8.30.7'><b>8.30.7</b> It was brought from the hill Scoleitas, which is within the walls, and from a spring on it a stream descends to the <pl id='Q15137556'>Helisson</pl>. Behind the government offices is a temple of <prn id='Q213440'>Fortune</prn> with a stone image not less than five feet high. The portico called Myropolis, situated in the agora, was built from the spoils taken when the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> fighting under <prn id='Q421184'>Acrotatus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q464632'>Cleomenes</prn>, suffered the reverse sustained at the hands of <prn id='Q4893643'>Aristodemus</prn>, then tyrant of <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.30.8'><b>8.30.8</b> In the marketplace of that city, behind the enclosure sacred to <pl id='Q111046342'>Lycaean</pl> <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, is the figure of a man carved in relief on a slab, <prn id='Q131169'>Polybius</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q2065138'>Lycortas</prn>. Elegiac verses are inscribed upon it saying that he roamed over every land and every sea, and that he became the ally of the Romans and stayed their wrath against the Greek nation. This <prn id='Q131169'>Polybius</prn> wrote also a history of the Romans, including how they went to war with <pl id='Q6343'>Carthage</pl>, what the cause of the war was, and how at last, not before great dangers had been run, <prn id='Q2253'>Scipio</prn> . . . whom they name Carthaginian, because he put an end to the war and razed <pl id='Q6343'>Carthage</pl> to the ground. </p>
<p id='8.30.9'><b>8.30.9</b> Whenever the Romans obeyed the advice of <prn id='Q131169'>Polybius</prn>, things went well with them, but they say that whenever they would not listen to his instructions they made mistakes. All the Greek cities that were members of the <prn id='Q244796'>Achaean League</prn> got permission from the Romans that <prn id='Q131169'>Polybius</prn> should draw up constitutions for them and frame laws. On the left of the portrait-statue of <prn id='Q131169'>Polybius</prn> is the Council Chamber. </p>
<p id='8.30.10'><b>8.30.10</b> Here then is the Chamber, but the portico called “<prn id='Q2616294'>Aristander</prn>'s” in the agora was built, they say, by <prn id='Q2616294'>Aristander</prn>, one of their townsfolk. Quite near to this portico, on the east, is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> surnamed <prn id='Q2303797'>Saviour</prn>. It is adorned with pillars round it. <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> is seated on a throne, and by his side stand <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl> on the right and an image of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> <prn id='Q2303797'>Saviour</prn> on the left. These are of <pl id='Q1125206'>Pentelic</pl> marble and were made by the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> <prn id='Q378772'>Cephisodotus</prn> and <prn id='Q1465890'>Xenophon</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.31.1'><b>8.31.1</b> At the other end, the western, of the portico is an enclosure sacred to the <prn id='Q30025797'>Great Goddesses</prn>. The <prn id='Q30025797'>Great Goddesses</prn> are <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> and <prn id='Q45967'>Kore</prn>, as I have already explained in my account of <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl>, and <prn id='Q45967'>Kore</prn> is called <prn id='Q2303797'>Saviour</prn> by the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl>. Carved in relief before the entrance are, on one side <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, on the other <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> and <prn id='Q202257'>Health</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.31.2'><b>8.31.2</b> Of the <prn id='Q30025797'>Great Goddesses</prn>, <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> is of stone throughout, but the <prn id='Q2303797'>Saviour</prn> has drapery of wood. The height of each is about fifteen feet. The images . . . and before them he made small maids in tunics reaching to the ankles, each of whom carries on her head a basket full of flowers. They are said to be daughters of <prn id='Q1158742'>Damophon</prn>, but those inclining to a more religious interpretation hold that they are <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> and <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> gathering the flowers with <prn id='Q45967'>Persephone</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.31.3'><b>8.31.3</b> By the side of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> there is also a <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> about a cubit high. This <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, says <prn id='Q537647'>Onomacritus</prn> in his poem, is one of those called <pl id='Q83659'>Idaean</pl> <prn id='Q831589'>Dactyls</prn>. Before it stands a table, on which are carved in relief two seasons, <prn id='Q132582'>Pan</prn> with pipes, and <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> playing the harp. There is also an inscription by them saying that they are among the first gods. </p>
<p id='8.31.4'><b>8.31.4</b> <prn id='Q373916'>Nymphs</prn> too are carved on the table: <prn id='Q1984901'>Neda</prn> carrying an infant <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, <prn id='Q29686726'>Anthracia</prn>, another <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadian</pl> nymph, holding a torch, and <prn id='Q62058069'>Hagno</prn> with a water-pot in one hand and a bowl in the other. <prn id='Q21548611'>Anchirhoe</prn> and <prn id='Q10592638'>Myrtoessa</prn> carry water-pots, with what is meant to be water coming down from them. Within the precinct is a temple of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> Philios (Friendly). <prn id='Q193422'>Polycleitus</prn> of <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> made the image; it is like <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> in having buskins as footwear and in holding a beaker in one hand and a thyrsus in the other, but an <prn id='Q2092297'>eagle</prn> sitting on the thyrsus does not fit in with the received accounts of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.31.5'><b>8.31.5</b> Behind this temple is a small grove of trees surrounded by a wall; nobody may go inside, and before it are images of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> and <prn id='Q45967'>Kore</prn> some three feet high. Within the enclosure of the <prn id='Q30025797'>Great Goddesses</prn> is also a sanctuary of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>. Before the entrance are old xoana of <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn>, <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> and the <prn id='Q66016'>Muses</prn>, brought, it is said, from <pl id='Q7835586'>Trapezus</pl>, </p>
<p id='8.31.6'><b>8.31.6</b> and in the temple are images made by <prn id='Q1158742'>Damophon</prn>, a wooden <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> and a wooden <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> with hands, face and feet of stone. The surname Machanitis (Deviser) given to the goddess is, in my opinion, a most apt one; for very many are the devices, and most varied are the forms of speech invented by men because of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> and her works. </p>
<p id='8.31.7'><b>8.31.7</b> In a building stand statues also, those of Callignotus, Mentas, Sosigenes1 and Polus1. These men are said to have been the first to establish at <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl> the mysteries of the <prn id='Q30025797'>Great Goddesses</prn>, and the ritual acts are a copy of those at <pl id='Q94299853'>Eleusis</pl>. Within the enclosure of the goddesses are the following images, which all have a square shape: <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn>, surnamed <prn id='Q393088'>Agetor</prn>, <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, <prn id='Q134270'>Helios</prn> too, surnamed <prn id='Q2303797'>Saviour</prn>, and <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>. There has also been built for them a sanctuary of vast size, and here they celebrate the mysteries in honor of the goddesses. </p>
<p id='8.31.8'><b>8.31.8</b> To the right of the temple of the <prn id='Q30025797'>Great Goddesses</prn> there is also a sanctuary of <prn id='Q45967'>Kore</prn>. The image is of stone, about eight feet high; ribbons cover the pedestal all over. Women may enter this sanctuary at all times, but men enter it only once every year. Adjoining the agora on the west there is built a gymnasium. </p>
<p id='8.31.9'><b>8.31.9</b> Behind the stoa called after <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn> of <pl id='Q81734'>Macedon</pl> are two hills, rising to no great height. Ruins of a sanctuary of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> <prn id='Q107090895'>Polias</prn> are on one, while on the other a temple of <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> <prn id='Q106880607'>Teleia</prn> (Full-grown), this too being in ruins. Under this hill is a spring called <prn id='Q791314'>Bathyllus</prn>, which is one of the tributaries that swell the <pl id='Q15137556'>Helisson</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.32.1'><b>8.32.1</b> Such are the notable things on this site. The southern portion, on the other side of the river, can boast of the largest <pl id='Q22681531'>theater</pl> in all Greece, and in it is a spring which never fails. Not far from the theater are left foundations of the council house built for the Ten Thousand <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl>, and called Thersilium after the man who dedicated it. Hard by is a house, belonging today to a private person, which originally was built for <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn>. By the house is an image of <prn id='Q3575327'>Ammon</prn>, like the square images of <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn>, with a ram's horns on his head. </p>
<p id='8.32.2'><b>8.32.2</b> The sanctuary built in common for the <prn id='Q66016'>Muses</prn>, <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> and <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> had for me to record only a few foundations, but there was still one of the <prn id='Q66016'>Muses</prn>, with an image of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> after the style of the square Hermae. The sanctuary of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> too was in ruins, save that there were left the fore-temple and three images, one surnamed <prn id='Q423622'>Ourania</prn> (Heavenly), the second <prn id='Q4779733'>Pandemos</prn> (Common), and the third without a surname. </p>
<p id='8.32.3'><b>8.32.3</b> At no great distance is an altar of <prn id='Q40901'>Ares</prn>, and it was said that originally a sanctuary too was built for the god. Beyond the <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> is built also a race-course, extending on one side to the <pl id='Q22681531'>theater</pl> (and here they have a spring, held sacred to <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>), while at the other end of the race-course a temple of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> was said to have been struck by lightning two generations before my time, and a few ruins of it were still there when I saw it. The temple near the race-course shared by <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> and <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> was no longer there, only their altar was left. </p>
<p id='8.32.4'><b>8.32.4</b> There is also in this district a hill to the east, and on it a temple of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> <prn id='Q1458788'>Agrotera</prn> this too was dedicated by <prn id='Q4893643'>Aristodemus</prn>. To the right of <prn id='Q1458788'>Agrotera</prn> is a precinct. Here there is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>, with images of the god and of <prn id='Q202257'>Health</prn>, and a little lower down there are gods, also of square shape, surnamed Ergatai (workers), <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> <prn id='Q1350313'>Ergane</prn> and <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> <prn id='Q3848037'>Agyieus</prn>. To <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn>, <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> and <prn id='Q94066'>Eileithyia</prn> are attached traditions from the poems of <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>: that <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> is the minister of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> and leads the souls of the departed down to <pl id='Q1521549'>Hades</pl>, and that <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> accomplished many difficult tasks; <prn id='Q94066'>Eileithyia</prn>, he says in the <prn id='Q8275'>Iliad</prn>, cares for the pangs of women. </p>
<p id='8.32.5'><b>8.32.5</b> Under this hill there is another sanctuary of Boy <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>. His image is upright and about a cubit in height, that of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> is seated on a throne and is not less than six feet high. Here are also kept bones, too big for those of a human being, about which the story ran that they were those of one of the giants mustered by <prn id='Q3140400'>Hopladamus</prn> to fight for <prn id='Q108419'>Rhea</prn>, as my story will relate hereafter. Near this sanctuary is a spring, the water flowing down from which is received by the <pl id='Q15137556'>Helisson</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.33.1'><b>8.33.1</b> <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl> was founded by the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> with the utmost enthusiasm amidst the highest hopes of the Greeks, but it has lost all its beauty and its old prosperity, being today for the most part in ruins. I am not in the least surprised, as I know that heaven is always willing something new, and likewise that all things, strong or weak, increasing or decreasing, are being changed by <prn id='Q213440'>Fortune</prn>, who drives them with imperious necessity according to her whim. </p>
<p id='8.33.2'><b>8.33.2</b> For <pl id='Q132564'>Mycenae</pl>, the leader of the Greeks in the <prn id='Q42937'>Trojan War</prn>, and <pl id='Q5680'>Nineveh</pl>, where was the royal palace of the AssyriansYY, are utterly ruined and desolate; while <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotian</pl> <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>, once deemed worthy to be the head of the Greek people, why, its name includes only the acropolis and its few inhabitants. Of the opulent places in the ancient world, <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptian</pl> <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> and <prn id='Q1065225'>Minyan</prn> <pl id='Q1855083'>Orchomenus</pl> are now less prosperous than a private individual of moderate means, while <pl id='Q173148'>Delos</pl>, once the common market of Greece, has no <pl id='Q173148'>Delian</pl> inhabitant, but only the men sent by the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> to guard the sanctuary. </p>
<p id='8.33.3'><b>8.33.3</b> At <pl id='Q5684'>Babylon</pl> the sanctuary of <prn id='Q617753'>Belus</prn> still is left, but of the <pl id='Q5684'>Babylon</pl> that was the greatest city of its time under the sun nothing remains but the wall. The case of <pl id='Q217379'>Tiryns</pl> in the <pl id='Q12649101'>Argolid</pl> is the same. These places have been reduced by heaven to nothing. But the city of <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn> in <pl id='Q11768'>Egypt</pl>, and that of <prn id='Q184176'>Seleucus</prn> on the <pl id='Q188871'>Orontes</pl>, that were founded but yesterday, have reached their present size and prosperity because fortune favours them. </p>
<p id='8.33.4'><b>8.33.4</b> The following incident proves the might of fortune to be greater and more marvellous than is shown by the disasters and prosperity of cities. No long sail from <pl id='Q192483'>Lemnos</pl> was once an island <pl id='Q1088480'>Chryse</pl>, where, it is said, <prn id='Q212827'>Philoctetes</prn> met with his accident from the water-<prn id='Q2102'>snake</prn>. But the waves utterly overwhelmed it, and <pl id='Q1088480'>Chryse</pl> sank and disappeared in the depths. Another island called <pl id='Q1419053'>Hiera</pl> (Sacred) . . . was not during this time. So temporary and utterly weak are the fortunes of men. </p>
<p id='8.34.1'><b>8.34.1</b> As you go from <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl> to <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl>, after advancing about seven stades, there stands on the left of the highway a sanctuary of goddesses. They call the goddesses themselves, as well as the district around the sanctuary, <prn id='Q6749449'>Maniae</prn> (Madnesses). In my view this is an epithet of the <prn id='Q180262'>Eumenides</prn>; in fact they say that it was here that madness overtook <prn id='Q192407'>Orestes</prn> as punishment for shedding his mother's blood. </p>
<p id='8.34.2'><b>8.34.2</b> Not far from the sanctuary is a mound of earth, of no great size, surmounted by a finger made of stone; the name, indeed, of the mound is the Tomb of the Finger. Here, it is said, <prn id='Q192407'>Orestes</prn> on losing his wits bit off one finger of one of his hands. Adjoining this place is another, called Ake (Remedies) because in it <prn id='Q192407'>Orestes</prn> was cured of his malady. Here too there is a sanctuary for the <prn id='Q180262'>Eumenides</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.34.3'><b>8.34.3</b> The story is that, when these goddesses were about to put <prn id='Q192407'>Orestes</prn> out of his mind, they appeared to him black; but when he had bitten off his finger they seemed to him again to be white and he recovered his senses at the sight. So he offered a sin-offering to the black goddesses to avert their wrath, while to the white deities he sacrificed a thank-offering. It is customary to sacrifice to the <prn id='Q184353'>Graces</prn> also along with the <prn id='Q180262'>Eumenides</prn>. Near to the place called Ake is another . . . a sanctuary called . . . because here <prn id='Q192407'>Orestes</prn> cut off his hair on coming to his senses. </p>
<p id='8.34.4'><b>8.34.4</b> Historians of <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesian</pl> antiquities say that what <prn id='Q131157'>Clytaemnestra</prn>'s <prn id='Q180262'>Furies</prn> did to <prn id='Q192407'>Orestes</prn> in <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl> took place before the trial at the <pl id='Q202487'>Areopagus</pl>; that his accuser was not <prn id='Q192946'>Tyndareus</prn>, who no longer lived, but <prn id='Q1224032'>Perilaus</prn>, who asked for vengeance for the mother's murder in that he was a cousin of <prn id='Q131157'>Clytaemnestra</prn>. For <prn id='Q1224032'>Perilaus</prn>, they say, was a son of <prn id='Q1658054'>Icarius</prn>, to whom afterwards daughters also were born. </p>
<p id='8.34.5'><b>8.34.5</b> The road from Maniae to the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl> is roughly fifteen stades long. At this point the river Gatheatas falls into the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl>, and before this the <pl id='Q15145507'>Carnion</pl> flows into the Gatheatas. The source of the <pl id='Q15145507'>Carnion</pl> is in <pl id='Q15872679'>Aegytian</pl> territory beneath the sanctuary of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> <prn id='Q107313035'>Cereatas</prn>; that of the Gatheatas is at <pl id='Q60791914'>Gatheae</pl> in <pl id='Q11916188'>Cromitian</pl> territory. </p>
<p id='8.34.6'><b>8.34.6</b> The <pl id='Q11916188'>Cromitian</pl> territory is about forty stades up from the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl>, and in it the ruins of the city <pl id='Q11916188'>Cromi</pl> have not entirely disappeared. From <pl id='Q11916188'>Cromi</pl> it is about twenty stades to Nymphas, which is well supplied with water and covered with trees. From Nymphas it is twenty stades to the Hermaeum, where is the boundary between <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl> and <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl>. Here they have made a <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> also on a slab. </p>
<p id='8.35.1'><b>8.35.1</b> This road leads to <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl>, and there is another leading from <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl> to <pl id='Q28000806'>Carnasium</pl> in <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl>. The first thing you come to on the latter road is the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl> at the place where it is joined by the MalusYY and the Scyrus, whose waters have already united. From this point keeping the MalusYY on the right after about thirty stades you will cross it and ascend along a rather steep road to a place called PhaedriasYY. </p>
<p id='8.35.2'><b>8.35.2</b> About fifteen stades distant from PhaedriasYY is an Hermaeum called “by Despoina”; it too forms a boundary between <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl> and <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl>. There are small agalmata of <prn id='Q1146978'>Despoina</prn> and <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>; likewise of <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> and <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>. I am of opinion that the <prn id='Q693222'>xoanon</prn> also, made for <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> by <prn id='Q134756'>Daedalus</prn>, stood here on the borders of <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl> and <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.35.3'><b>8.35.3</b> The road from <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl> to <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl> is thirty stades long at the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl>. After this you will travel beside a river Theius, which is a tributary of the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl>, and some forty stades from the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl> leaving the Theius on the left you will come to <pl id='Q60791911'>Phalaesiae</pl>. This place is twenty stades away from the Hermaeum at <pl id='Q16537117'>Belemina</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.35.4'><b>8.35.4</b> The <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> say that <pl id='Q16537117'>Belemina</pl> belonged of old to <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl> but was severed from it by the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. This account struck me as improbable on various grounds, chiefly because the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl>, I think, would never have allowed the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> to suffer even this loss, if they could have brought about restitution with justice. </p>
<p id='8.35.5'><b>8.35.5</b> There are also roads from <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl> leading to the interior of <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl>; to <pl id='Q60790161'>Methydrium</pl> it is one hundred and seventy stades, and thirteen stades from <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl> is a place called <prn id='Q7534977'>Scias</prn>, where are ruins of a sanctuary of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> Sciatis, said to have been built by <prn id='Q4893643'>Aristodemus</prn> the tyrant. About ten stades from here are a few memorials of the city <pl id='Q5074395'>Charisiae</pl>, and the journey from <pl id='Q5074395'>Charisiae</pl> to <pl id='Q16331632'>Tricoloni</pl> is another ten stades. </p>
<p id='8.35.6'><b>8.35.6</b> Once <pl id='Q16331632'>Tricoloni</pl> also was a city, and even today there still remains on a hill a sanctuary of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> with a square image, and around the sanctuary stands a grove of trees. These cities had as founders the sons of <prn id='Q501667'>Lycaon</prn>; but <pl id='Q8073335'>Zoetia</pl>, some fifteen stades from <pl id='Q16331632'>Tricoloni</pl>, not lying on the straight road but to the left of <pl id='Q16331632'>Tricoloni</pl>, was founded, they say, by <prn id='Q106411176'>Zoeteus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q16331636'>Tricolonus</prn>. Paroreus, the younger of the sons of <prn id='Q16331636'>Tricolonus</prn>, also founded a city, in this case <pl id='Q3605950'>Paroria</pl>, ten stades distant from <pl id='Q8073335'>Zoetia</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.35.7'><b>8.35.7</b> Today both towns are without inhabitants. In <pl id='Q8073335'>Zoetia</pl>, however, there still remains a temple of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> and <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>. There are also other ruins of cities: of <pl id='Q7799665'>Thyraeum</pl>, fifteen stades from <pl id='Q3605950'>Paroria</pl>, and of <pl id='Q12885662'>Hypsus</pl>, lying above the plain on a mountain which is also called <pl id='Q12885662'>Hypsus</pl>. The district between <pl id='Q7799665'>Thyraeum</pl> and <pl id='Q12885662'>Hypsus</pl> is all mountainous and full of wild beasts. My narrative has already pointed out that Thyraeus and Hypsus were sons of <prn id='Q501667'>Lycaon</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.35.8'><b>8.35.8</b> To the right of <pl id='Q16331632'>Tricoloni</pl> there is first a steep road ascending to a spring called Cruni. Descending from Cruni for about thirty stades you come to the grave of <prn id='Q203673'>Callisto</prn>, a high mound of earth, whereon grow many trees, both cultivated and also those that bear no fruit. On the top of the mound is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, surnamed <prn id='Q56452489'>Calliste</prn> (Most Beautiful). I believe it was because he had learnt it from the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> that <prn id='Q11939948'>Pamphos</prn> was the first in his poems to call <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> by the name of <prn id='Q56452489'>Calliste</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.35.9'><b>8.35.9</b> Twenty-five stades from here, a hundred stades in all from <pl id='Q16331632'>Tricoloni</pl>, there is on the <pl id='Q15137556'>Helisson</pl>, on the straight road to <pl id='Q60790161'>Methydrium</pl>, the only city left to be described on the road from <pl id='Q16331632'>Tricoloni</pl>, a place called <pl id='Q48781590'>Anemosa</pl>, and also Mount <prn id='Q106413024'>Phalanthus</prn>, on which are the ruins of a city <prn id='Q106413024'>Phalanthus</prn>. It is said that <prn id='Q106413024'>Phalanthus</prn> was a son of <prn id='Q2634988'>Agelaus</prn>, a son of <prn id='Q775176'>Stymphalus</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.35.10'><b>8.35.10</b> Beyond this is a plain called the Plain of Polus1, and after it <prn id='Q60791216'>Schoenus</prn>, so named from a <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotian</pl>, <prn id='Q2640491'>Schoeneus</prn>. If this <prn id='Q2640491'>Schoeneus</prn> emigrated to <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl>, the race-courses of <prn id='Q190323'>Atalanta</prn>, which are near Schoenus, probably got their name from his daughter. Adjoining is . . . in my opinion called, and they say that the land here is <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl> to all. </p>
<p id='8.36.1'><b>8.36.1</b> From this point nothing remains to be recorded except <pl id='Q60790161'>Methydrium</pl> itself, which is distant from <pl id='Q16331632'>Tricoloni</pl> one hundred and thirty-seven stades. It received the name <pl id='Q60790161'>Methydrium</pl> (Between the Waters) because there is a high knoll between the river Maloetas and the Mylaon, and on it <prn id='Q21844796'>Orchomenus</prn> built his city. <pl id='Q60790161'>Methydrium</pl> too had citizens victorious at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> before it belonged to <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.36.2'><b>8.36.2</b> There is in <pl id='Q60790161'>Methydrium</pl> a temple of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> <prn id='Q20100719'>Hippios</prn>, standing by the Mylaon. But Mount ThaumasiuYY (Wonderful) lies beyond the river Maloetas, and the <pl id='Q60790161'>Methydrians</pl> hold that when <prn id='Q108419'>Rhea</prn> was pregnant with <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, she came to this mountain and enlisted as her allies, in case <prn id='Q44204'>Cronus</prn> should attack her, <prn id='Q3140400'>Hopladamus</prn> and his few giants: </p>
<p id='8.36.3'><b>8.36.3</b> They allow that she gave birth to her son on some part of Mount <pl id='Q1878690'>Lykaion</pl>, but they claim that here <prn id='Q44204'>Cronus</prn> was deceived, and here took place the substitution of a stone for the child that is spoken of in the Greek legend. On the summit of the mountain is <prn id='Q108419'>Rhea</prn>'s Cave, into which no human beings may enter save only the women who are sacred to the goddess. </p>
<p id='8.36.4'><b>8.36.4</b> About thirty stades from <pl id='Q60790161'>Methydrium</pl> is a spring Nymphasia, and it is also thirty stades from Nymphasia to the common boundaries of <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl>, <pl id='Q1855083'>Orchomenus</pl> and <pl id='Q2365548'>Caphyae</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.36.5'><b>8.36.5</b> Passing through the gate at <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl> named the Gate to the Marsh, and proceeding by the side of the river <pl id='Q15137556'>Helisson</pl> towards <pl id='Q112302501'>Maenalus</pl>, there stands on the left of the road a temple of the Good God. If the gods are givers of good things to men, and if <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> is supreme among gods, it would be consistent to infer that this surname is that of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>. A short distance farther on is a mound of earth which is the grave of <prn id='Q4893643'>Aristodemus</prn>, whom in spite of his being a tyrant they could not help calling the Good and there is also a sanctuary of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> surnamed <prn id='Q106416220'>Machanitis</prn> (Contriver), because the goddess is the inventor of plans and devices of all sorts. </p>
<p id='8.36.6'><b>8.36.6</b> On the right of the road there has been made a precinct to the <prn id='Q109220'>North Wind</prn>, and the <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolitans</pl> offer sacrifices every year, holding none of the gods in greater honor than the <prn id='Q109220'>North Wind</prn>, because he proved their saviour from the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> under <prn id='Q314364'>Agis</prn>. Next is the tomb of <prn id='Q1358973'>Oicles</prn>, the father of <prn id='Q330584'>Amphiaraus</prn>, if indeed he met his end in <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl>, and not after he had joined <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> in his campaign against <prn id='Q332324'>Laomedon</prn>. After it comes a temple of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> styled in the Marsh and her grove, which is five stades away from the city, and women only may enter it. </p>
<p id='8.36.7'><b>8.36.7</b> Thirty stades away is a place named <prn id='Q112336192'>Paliscius</prn>. Going on from Paliscius and leaving on the left the Elaphus, an intermittent stream, after an advance of some twenty stades you reach ruins of <pl id='Q39081772'>Peraethenses</pl>, among which is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q132582'>Pan</prn>. If you cross the torrent and go straight on for fifteen stades you come to a plain, and after crossing it to the mountain called, like the plain, <pl id='Q112302501'>Maenalian</pl>. Under the fringe of the mountain are traces of a city <pl id='Q11934312'>Lycoa</pl>, a sanctuary of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> Lycoatis, and a bronze image of her. </p>
<p id='8.36.8'><b>8.36.8</b> On the southern slope of the mountain once stood <pl id='Q39081737'>Sumetia</pl>. On this mountain is what is called the Triodion (Meeting of the Three Ways), whence the <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineans</pl> fetched the bones of <prn id='Q606422'>Arcas</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q203673'>Callisto</prn>, at the bidding of the <prn id='Q682558'>Delphic oracle</prn>. There are still left ruins of <pl id='Q11936450'>Maenalus</pl> itself: traces of a temple of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, one race-course for athletes and one for <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn>. Mount <pl id='Q112302501'>Maenalus</pl> is held to be especially sacred to <prn id='Q132582'>Pan</prn>, so that those who dwell around it say that they can actually hear him playing on his pipes. </p>
<p id='8.36.9'><b>8.36.9</b> From the <pl id='Q38281257'>sanctuary</pl> of <prn id='Q1146978'>Despoina</prn> to the city of <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl> it is forty stades. From <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl> to the stream of the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl> is half this distance. After crossing the river it is two stades from the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl> to the ruins of <pl id='Q11934483'>Macareae</pl>, from these to the ruins of <pl id='Q5226539'>Daseae</pl> seven stades, and seven again from <pl id='Q5226539'>Daseae</pl> to the hill called Acacesian Hill. </p>
<p id='8.36.10'><b>8.36.10</b> At the foot of this hill used to be a city <pl id='Q48781557'>Acacesium</pl>, and even today there is on the hill a stone image of Acacesian <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn>, the story of the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> about it being that here the child <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> was reared, and that <prn id='Q415491'>Acacus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q501667'>Lycaon</prn> became his foster-father. The <pl id='Q11225429'>Theban</pl> legend is different, and the people of <pl id='Q56259452'>Tanagra</pl>, again, have a legend at variance with the <pl id='Q11225429'>Theban</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.37.1'><b>8.37.1</b> From <pl id='Q48781557'>Acacesium</pl> it is four stades to the <pl id='Q38281257'>sanctuary</pl> of <prn id='Q1146978'>Despoina</prn> (the Mistress). First in this place is a temple of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> Leader, with a bronze image, holding torches, which I conjecture to be about six feet high. From this place there is an entrance into the sacred enclosure of <prn id='Q1146978'>Despoina</prn>. As you go to the temple there is a portico on the right, with reliefs of white marble on the wall. On the first relief are wrought <prn id='Q180287'>Fates</prn> and <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> surnamed Guide of <prn id='Q180287'>Fate</prn>, and on the second <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> wresting a tripod from <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>. What I learned about the story of the two latter I will tell if I get as far as an account of <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> in my history of <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.37.2'><b>8.37.2</b> In the portico by <prn id='Q1146978'>Despoina</prn> there is, between the reliefs I have mentioned, a tablet with descriptions of the mysteries. On the third relief are nymphs and Pans; on the fourth is <prn id='Q131169'>Polybius</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q2065138'>Lycortas</prn>. On the latter is also an inscription, declaring that Greece would never have fallen at all, if she had obeyed <prn id='Q131169'>Polybius</prn> in everything, and when she met disaster her only help came from him. In front of the temple is an altar to <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> and another to <prn id='Q1146978'>Despoina</prn>, after which is one of the <prn id='Q334486'>Great Mother</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.37.3'><b>8.37.3</b> The actual images of the goddesses, <prn id='Q1146978'>Despoina</prn> and <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>, the throne on which they sit, along with the footstool under their feet, are all made out of one piece of stone. No part of the drapery, and no part of the carvings about the throne, is fastened to another stone by iron or cement, but the whole is from one block. This stone was not brought in by them, but they say that in obedience to a dream they dug up the earth within the enclosure and so found it. The size of both images just about corresponds to the image of the <prn id='Q334486'>Mother</prn> at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.37.4'><b>8.37.4</b> These too are works of <prn id='Q1158742'>Damophon</prn>. <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> carries a torch in her right hand; her other hand she has laid upon the <prn id='Q1146978'>Despoina</prn>. <prn id='Q1146978'>Despoina</prn> has on her knees a staff and what is called the box, which she holds in her right hand. On both sides of the throne are images. By the side of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> stands <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> wrapped in the skin of a deer, and carrying a quiver on her shoulders, while in one hand she holds a torch, in the other two <prn id='Q2102'>serpents</prn>; by her side a <prn id='Q144'>bitch</prn>, of a breed suitable for hunting, is lying down. </p>
<p id='8.37.5'><b>8.37.5</b> By the image of <prn id='Q1146978'>Despoina</prn> stands <prn id='Q614030'>Anytus</prn>, represented as a man in armour. Those about the sanctuary say that the <prn id='Q1146978'>Despoina</prn> was brought up by <prn id='Q614030'>Anytus</prn>, who was one of the <prn id='Q45713'>Titans</prn>, as they are called. The first to introduce <prn id='Q45713'>Titans</prn> into poetry was <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>, representing them as gods down in what is called <prn id='Q101322'>Tartarus</prn>; the lines are in the passage about <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn>'s oath. From <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> the name of the <prn id='Q45713'>Titans</prn> was taken by <prn id='Q537647'>Onomacritus</prn>, who in the orgies he composed for <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> made the <prn id='Q45713'>Titans</prn> the authors of the god's sufferings. </p>
<p id='8.37.6'><b>8.37.6</b> This is the story of <prn id='Q614030'>Anytus</prn> told by the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl>. That <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> was the daughter, not of <prn id='Q103107'>Leto</prn> but of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>, which is the <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptian</pl> account, the Greeks learned from <prn id='Q40939'>Aeschylus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q13410739'>Euphorion</prn>. The story of the <prn id='Q247617'>Curetes</prn>, who are represented under the images, and that of the <prn id='Q631406'>Corybantes</prn> (a different race from the <prn id='Q247617'>Curetes</prn>), carved in relief upon the base, I know, but pass them by. </p>
<p id='8.37.7'><b>8.37.7</b> The <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> bring into the sanctuary the fruit of all cultivated trees except the pomegranate. On the right as you go out of the temple there is a mirror fitted into the wall. If anyone looks into this mirror, he will see himself very dimly indeed or not at all, but the actual images of the gods and the throne can be seen quite clearly. </p>
<p id='8.37.8'><b>8.37.8</b> When you have gone up a little, beside the temple of <prn id='Q1146978'>Despoina</prn> on the right is what is called the Megaron, where the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> celebrate mysteries, and sacrifice to <prn id='Q1146978'>Despoina</prn> many victims in generous fashion. Every man of them sacrifices what he possesses. But he does not cut the throats of the victims, as is done in other sacrifices; each man chops off a limb of the sacrifice, just that which happens to come to hand. </p>
<p id='8.37.9'><b>8.37.9</b> This <prn id='Q1146978'>Despoina</prn> the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> worship more than any other god, declaring that she is a daughter of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> and <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>. <prn id='Q1146978'>Despoina</prn> is her surname among the many, just as they surname <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>'s daughter by <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q45967'>Kore</prn>. But whereas the real name of <prn id='Q45967'>Kore</prn> is <prn id='Q45967'>Persephone</prn>, as <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> and <prn id='Q11939948'>Pamphos</prn> before him say in their poems, the real name of <prn id='Q1146978'>Despoina</prn> I am afraid to write to the uninitiated. </p>
<p id='8.37.10'><b>8.37.10</b> Beyond what is called the Megaron is a grove, sacred to <prn id='Q1146978'>Despoina</prn> and surrounded by a wall of stones, and within it are trees, including an olive and an evergreen oak growing out of one root, and that not the result of a clever piece of gardening. Beyond the grove are altars of <prn id='Q726'>Horse</prn> <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, as being the father of <prn id='Q1146978'>Despoina</prn>, and of other gods as well. On the last of them is an inscription saying that it is common to all the gods. </p>
<p id='8.37.11'><b>8.37.11</b> Thence you will ascend by stairs to a sanctuary of <prn id='Q132582'>Pan</prn>. Within the sanctuary has been made a portico, and a small image; and this <prn id='Q132582'>Pan</prn> too, equally with the most powerful gods, can bring men's prayers to accomplishment and repay the wicked as they deserve. Beside this <prn id='Q132582'>Pan</prn> a fire is kept burning which is never allowed to go out. It is said that in days of old this god also gave oracles, and that the nymph <prn id='Q782764'>Erato</prn> became his prophetess, she who wedded <prn id='Q606422'>Arcas</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q203673'>Callisto</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.37.12'><b>8.37.12</b> They also remember verses of <prn id='Q782764'>Erato</prn>, which I too myself have read. Here is an altar of <prn id='Q40901'>Ares</prn>, and there are two images of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> in a temple, one of white marble, and the other, the older, of wood. There are also wooden images of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> and of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>. Of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> a sanctuary also has been made. </p>
<p id='8.38.1'><b>8.38.1</b> A little farther up is the circuit of the wall of <pl id='Q1878714'>Lycosura</pl>, in which there are a few inhabitants. Of all the cities that earth has ever shown, whether on mainland or on islands, <pl id='Q1878714'>Lycosura</pl> is the oldest, and was the first that the sun beheld; from it the rest of mankind have learned how to make them cities. </p>
<p id='8.38.2'><b>8.38.2</b> On the left of the sanctuary of <prn id='Q1146978'>Despoina</prn> is <pl id='Q1878690'>Mount Lykaion</pl>. Some <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> call it Olympus, and others Sacred Peak. On it, they say, <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> was reared. There is a place on <pl id='Q1878690'>Mount Lykaion</pl> called Cretea, on the left of the grove of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> surnamed <pl id='Q7139774'>Parrhasian</pl>. The <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> claim that the Crete, where the <pl id='Q4752820'>Cretan</pl> story has it that <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> was reared, was this place and not the <pl id='Q4752820'>island</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.38.3'><b>8.38.3</b> The nymphs, by whom they say that <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> was reared, they call <prn id='Q15054706'>Theisoa</prn>, <prn id='Q1984901'>Neda</prn> and <prn id='Q62058069'>Hagno</prn>. After <prn id='Q15054706'>Theisoa</prn> was named a city in <pl id='Q7139774'>Parrhasia</pl>; <pl id='Q15054733'>Theisoa</pl> today is a village in the district of <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl>. From <prn id='Q1984901'>Neda</prn> the river <pl id='Q1641987'>Neda</pl> takes its name; from <prn id='Q62058069'>Hagno</prn> a spring on <pl id='Q1878690'>Mount Lykaion</pl>, which like the <pl id='Q1653'>Danube</pl> flows with an equal volume of water in winter just as in the season of summer. </p>
<p id='8.38.4'><b>8.38.4</b> Should a drought persist for a long time, and the seeds in the earth and the trees wither, then the priest of <pl id='Q111046342'>Lycaean</pl> <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, after praying towards the water and making the usual sacrifices, lowers an oak branch to the surface of the spring, not letting it sink deep. When the water has been stirred up there rises a vapor, like mist; after a time the mist becomes cloud, gathers to itself other clouds, and makes rain fall on the land of the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.38.5'><b>8.38.5</b> There is on <pl id='Q1878690'>Mount Lykaion</pl> a sanctuary of <prn id='Q132582'>Pan</prn>, and a grove of trees around it, with a race-course in front of which is a running-track. Of old they used to hold here the <pl id='Q111046342'>Lycaean</pl> games. Here there are also bases of statues, with now no statues on them. On one of the bases an elegiac inscription declares that the statue was a portrait of <prn id='Q106886990'>Astyanax</prn>, and that <prn id='Q106886990'>Astyanax</prn> was of the race of <prn id='Q606422'>Arcas</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.38.6'><b>8.38.6</b> Among the marvels of Mount <pl id='Q1878690'>Lycaeus</pl> the most wonderful is this. On it is a precinct of <pl id='Q111046342'>Lycaean</pl> <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, into which people are not allowed to enter. If anyone takes no notice of the rule and enters, he must inevitably live no longer than a year. A legend, moreover, was current that everything alike within the precinct, whether beast or man, cast no shadow. For this reason when a beast takes refuge in the precinct, the hunter will not rush in after it, but remains outside, and though he sees the beast can behold no shadow. In <pl id='Q29888'>Syene</pl> also just on this side of <pl id='Q410453'>Aethiopia</pl> neither tree nor creature casts a shadow so long as the sun is in the constellation of the Crab, but the precinct on Mount <pl id='Q1878690'>Lycaeus</pl> affects shadows in the same way always and at every season. </p>
<p id='8.38.7'><b>8.38.7</b> On the highest point of the mountain is a mound of earth, forming an altar of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <pl id='Q111046342'>Lycaeus</pl>, and from it most of the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl> can be seen. Before the altar on the east stand two pillars, on which there were of old gilded <prn id='Q2092297'>eagles</prn>. On this altar they sacrifice in secret to <pl id='Q111046342'>Lycaean</pl> <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>. I was reluctant to pry into the details of the sacrifice; let them be as they are and were from the beginning. </p>
<p id='8.38.8'><b>8.38.8</b> On the east side of the mountain there is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> surnamed <pl id='Q7139774'>Parrhasian</pl>. They also give him the name <pl id='Q682558'>Pythian</pl>. They hold every year a festival in honor of the god and sacrifice in the agora a <prn id='Q58697'>boar</prn> to <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> Helper, and after the sacrifice here they at once carry the victim to the sanctuary of <pl id='Q7139774'>Parrhasian</pl> <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> in procession to the music of the flute; cutting out the thigh-bones they burn them, and also consume the meat of the victim on the spot. </p>
<p id='8.38.9'><b>8.38.9</b> This it is their custom to do. To the north of <pl id='Q1878690'>Mount Lykaion</pl> is the <pl id='Q16327480'>Theisoan</pl> territory. The inhabitants of it worship most the nymph <prn id='Q15054706'>Theisoa</prn>. There flow through the land of <pl id='Q16327480'>Theisoa</pl> the following tributaries of the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl>, the Mylaon, Nus, <prn id='Q60790558'>Achelous</prn>, Celadus, and Naliphus. There are two other rivers of the same name as the <prn id='Q391379'>Achelous</prn> in <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl>, and more famous than it. </p>
<p id='8.38.10'><b>8.38.10</b> One <pl id='Q203923'>Achelous</pl>, falling into the sea by the <pl id='Q767387'>Echinadian</pl> islands, flows through <pl id='Q416070'>Acarnania</pl> and <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolia</pl>, and is said by <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> in the <prn id='Q8275'>Iliad</prn> to be the prince of all rivers. Another <prn id='Q391379'>Achelous</prn>, flowing from Mount <pl id='Q532698'>Sipylus</pl>, along with the mountain also, he takes occasion to mention in connection with his account of <prn id='Q213621'>Niobe</prn>. The third river called the <prn id='Q60790558'>Achelous</prn> is the one by <pl id='Q1878690'>Mount Lykaion</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.38.11'><b>8.38.11</b> On the right of <pl id='Q1878714'>Lycosura</pl> are the mountains called Nomian, and on them is a sanctuary of Nomian <prn id='Q132582'>Pan</prn>; the place they name <pl id='Q12880498'>Melpeia</pl>, saying that here <prn id='Q132582'>Pan</prn> discovered the music of the pipes. It is a very obvious conjecture that the name of the Nomian Mountains is derived from the pasturings (nomai) of <prn id='Q132582'>Pan</prn>, but the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> themselves derive the name from a nymph. </p>
<p id='8.39.1'><b>8.39.1</b> By <pl id='Q1878714'>Lycosura</pl> to the west passes the river <pl id='Q20108668'>Plataniston</pl>. No traveller can possibly avoid crossing the <pl id='Q20108668'>Plataniston</pl> who is going to <pl id='Q7623270'>Phigalia</pl>. Afterwards there is an ascent for some thirty stades or so. </p>
<p id='8.39.2'><b>8.39.2</b> The story of PhigalusYY, the son of <prn id='Q501667'>Lycaon</prn>, who was the original founder of the city, how in course of time the city made a change and called itself after <prn id='Q2835975'>Phialus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q5734880'>Bucolion</prn>, and again restored its old name, I have already set forth. Another account, but not worthy of credit, is current, that PhigalusYY was not a son of <prn id='Q501667'>Lycaon</prn> but an aboriginal. Others have said that <prn id='Q21638429'>Phigalia</prn> was one of the nymphs called <prn id='Q202474'>Dryads</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.39.3'><b>8.39.3</b> When the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> attacked the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> and invaded <pl id='Q7623270'>Phigalia</pl>, they overcame the inhabitants in battle and sat down to besiege the city. When the walls were in danger of capture the <pl id='Q7623270'>Phigalians</pl> ran away, or perhaps the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> let them come out under a truce. The taking of <pl id='Q7623270'>Phigalia</pl> and the flight of the <pl id='Q7623270'>Phigalians</pl> from it took place when <prn id='Q91012953'>Miltiades</prn> was <prn id='Q636144'>Archon</prn> at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, in the second year of the <prn id='Q57337697'>thirtieth Olympiad</prn> [659 BCE], when <prn id='Q1074480'>Chionis</prn> the <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconian</pl> was victorious for the third time. </p>
<p id='8.39.4'><b>8.39.4</b> The <pl id='Q7623270'>Phigalians</pl> who escaped resolved to go to <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> and ask the god about their return. The <prn id='Q220344'>Pythian priestess</prn> said that if they made the attempt by themselves she saw no return for them; but if they took with them one hundred picked men from <pl id='Q7101662'>Oresthasium</pl>, these would die in the battle, but through them the <pl id='Q7623270'>Phigalians</pl> would be restored to their city. When the <pl id='Q7101662'>Oresthasians</pl> heard of the oracle delivered to the <pl id='Q7623270'>Phigalians</pl>, all vied with one another in their eagerness to be one of the picked hundred and take part in the expedition to <pl id='Q7623270'>Phigalia</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.39.5'><b>8.39.5</b> They advanced against the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> garrison and fulfilled the oracle in all respects. For they fought and met their end gloriously; expelling the <pl id='Q5690'>Spartans</pl> they enabled the <pl id='Q7623270'>Phigalians</pl> to recover their native land. <pl id='Q7623270'>Phigalia</pl> lies on high land that is for the most part precipitous, and the walls are built on the cliffs. But on the top the hill is level and flat. Here there is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> <prn id='Q2303797'>Saviour</prn> with a standing image of stone. From this sanctuary it is their custom to start their processions. </p>
<p id='8.39.6'><b>8.39.6</b> The image of <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> in the gymnasium is like to one dressed in a cloak; but the statue does not end in feet, but in the square shape. A temple also of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> is here, who by the inhabitants is surnamed <prn id='Q21547822'>Acratophorus</prn>, but the lower part of the image cannot be seen for laurel-leaves and ivy. As much of it as can be seen is painted . . . with cinnabar to shine. It is said to be found by the <pl id='Q1203967'>Iberians</pl> along with the gold. </p>
<p id='8.40.1'><b>8.40.1</b> The <pl id='Q7623270'>Phigalians</pl> have on their agora a statue of the pancratiast <prn id='Q699635'>Arrhachion</prn>; it is archaic, especially in its posture. The feet are close together, and the arms hang down by the side as far as the hips. The statue is made of stone, and it is said that an inscription was written upon it. This has disappeared with time, but <prn id='Q699635'>Arrhachion</prn> won two <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> victories at Olympiads before the fifty-fourth, while at this Olympiad [564 BCE] he won one due partly to the fairness of the <prn id='Q1491624'>Hellanodikai</prn> and partly to his own manhood. </p>
<p id='8.40.2'><b>8.40.2</b> For when he was contending for the wild olive with the last remaining competitor, whoever he was, the latter got a grip first, and held <prn id='Q699635'>Arrhachion</prn>, hugging him with his legs, and at the same time he squeezed his neck with his hands. <prn id='Q699635'>Arrhachion</prn> dislocated his opponent's toe, but expired owing to suffocation; but he who suffocated <prn id='Q699635'>Arrhachion</prn> was forced to give in at the same time because of the pain in his toe. The <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> crowned and proclaimed victor the corpse of <prn id='Q699635'>Arrhachion</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.40.3'><b>8.40.3</b> I know that the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> acted similarly in the case of <prn id='Q16096278'>Creugas</prn>, a boxer of <pl id='Q3567546'>Epidamnus</pl>. For the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> too gave to <prn id='Q16096278'>Creugas</prn> after his death the crown in the <prn id='Q527006'>Nemean games</prn>, because his opponent <prn id='Q89098430'>Damoxenus</prn> of <pl id='Q4420718'>Syracuse</pl> broke their mutual agreement. For evening drew near as they were boxing, and they agreed within the hearing of witnesses, that each should in turn allow the other to deal him a blow. At that time boxers did not yet wear a sharp thong on the wrist of each hand, but still boxed with the soft gloves, binding them in the hollow of the hand, so that their fingers might be left bare. These soft gloves were thin thongs of raw <prn id='Q473194'>ox</prn>-hide plaited together after an ancient manner. </p>
<p id='8.40.4'><b>8.40.4</b> On the occasion to which I refer <prn id='Q16096278'>Creugas</prn> aimed his blow at the head of <prn id='Q89098430'>Damoxenus</prn>, and the latter bade <prn id='Q16096278'>Creugas</prn> lift up his arm. On his doing so, <prn id='Q89098430'>Damoxenus</prn> with straight fingers struck his opponent under the ribs; and what with the sharpness of his nails and the force of the blow he drove his hand into the other's inside, caught his bowels, and tore them as he pulled them out. </p>
<p id='8.40.5'><b>8.40.5</b> <prn id='Q16096278'>Creugas</prn> expired on the spot, and the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> expelled <prn id='Q89098430'>Damoxenus</prn> for breaking his agreement by dealing his opponent many blows instead of one. They gave the victory to the dead <prn id='Q16096278'>Creugas</prn>, and had a statue of him made in <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>. It still stood in my time in the sanctuary of Lykios <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.41.1'><b>8.41.1</b> In the agora of <pl id='Q7623270'>Phigalia</pl> there is also a common tomb of the picked men of <pl id='Q7101662'>Oresthasium</pl>, and every year they sacrifice to them as to heroes. </p>
<p id='8.41.2'><b>8.41.2</b> A river called the <prn id='Q15205042'>Lymax</prn> flowing just beside <pl id='Q7623270'>Phigalia</pl> falls into the <pl id='Q1641987'>Neda</pl>, and the river, they say, got its name from the cleansing of <prn id='Q108419'>Rhea</prn>. For when she had given birth to <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, the nymphs who cleansed her after her travail threw the refuse into this river. Now the ancients called refuse “lymata.” <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>, for example, says that the Greeks were cleansed, after the pestilence was stayed, and threw the lymata into the sea. </p>
<p id='8.41.3'><b>8.41.3</b> The source of the <pl id='Q1641987'>Neda</pl> is on Mount Cerausius, which is a part of <pl id='Q1878690'>Mount Lykaion</pl>. At the place where the <pl id='Q1641987'>Neda</pl> approaches nearest to <pl id='Q7623270'>Phigalia</pl> the boys of the <pl id='Q7623270'>Phigalians</pl> cut off their hair in honor of the river. Near the sea the <pl id='Q1641987'>Neda</pl> is navigable for small ships. Of all known rivers the <pl id='Q211089'>Maeander</pl> descends with the most winding course, which very often turns back and then bends round once more; but the second place for its twistings should be given to the <pl id='Q1641987'>Neda</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.41.4'><b>8.41.4</b> Some twelve stades above <pl id='Q7623270'>Phigalia</pl> are hot baths, and not far from these the <prn id='Q15205042'>Lymax</prn> falls into the <pl id='Q1641987'>Neda</pl>. Where the streams meet is the sanctuary of <prn id='Q548099'>Eurynome</prn>, a holy spot from of old and difficult of approach because of the roughness of the ground. Around it are many cypress trees, growing close together. </p>
<p id='8.41.5'><b>8.41.5</b> <prn id='Q548099'>Eurynome</prn> is believed by the people of <pl id='Q7623270'>Phigalia</pl> to be a surname of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>. Those of them, however, to whom have descended ancient traditions, declare that <prn id='Q548099'>Eurynome</prn> was a daughter of <prn id='Q161419'>Ocean</prn>, whom <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> mentions in the <prn id='Q8275'>Iliad</prn>, saying that along with <prn id='Q184437'>Thetis</prn> she received <prn id='Q44384'>Hephaestus</prn>. On the same day in each year they open the sanctuary of <prn id='Q548099'>Eurynome</prn>, but at any other time it is a transgression for them to open it. </p>
<p id='8.41.6'><b>8.41.6</b> On this occasion sacrifices also are offered by the state and by individuals. I did not arrive at the season of the festival, and I did not see the image of <prn id='Q548099'>Eurynome</prn>; but the <pl id='Q7623270'>Phigalians</pl> told me that golden chains bind the wooden image, which represents a woman as far as the hips, but below this a fish. If she is a daughter of <prn id='Q161419'>Ocean</prn>, and lives with <prn id='Q184437'>Thetis</prn> in the depth of the sea, the fish may be regarded as a kind of emblem of her. But there could be no probable connection between such a shape and <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.41.7'><b>8.41.7</b> <pl id='Q7623270'>Phigalia</pl> is surrounded by mountains, on the left by the mountain called <pl id='Q15209931'>Cotilius</pl>, while on the right is another, Mount <pl id='Q24896427'>Elaius</pl>, which acts as a shield to the city. The distance from the city to Mount <pl id='Q15209931'>Cotilius</pl> is about forty stades. On the mountain is a place called <pl id='Q38278862'>Bassae</pl>, and the temple of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> <prn id='Q3463121'>Epikourios</prn> (auxiliary), which, including the roof, is of stone. </p>
<p id='8.41.8'><b>8.41.8</b> Of the temples in the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl>, this might be placed first after the one at <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl> for the beauty of its stone and for its symmetry. <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> received his name from the help he gave in time of plague, just as the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> gave him the name of <prn id='Q4721374'>Alexikakos</prn> (averter of evil) for turning the <prn id='Q758173'>plague</prn> away from them. </p>
<p id='8.41.9'><b>8.41.9</b> It was at the time of the war between the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesians</pl> and the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> that he also saved the <pl id='Q7623270'>Phigalians</pl>, and at no other time; the evidence is that of the two surnames of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, which have practically the same meaning, and also the fact that <prn id='Q311502'>Ictinus</prn>, the architect of the <pl id='Q38278862'>temple</pl> at <pl id='Q7623270'>Phigalia</pl>, was a contemporary of <prn id='Q80398'>Pericles</prn>, and built for the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> what is called the <pl id='Q10288'>Parthenon</pl>. My narrative has already said that the statue of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> is in the agora of <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.41.10'><b>8.41.10</b> On Mount <pl id='Q15209931'>Cotilius</pl> is a spring of water, but the author who related that this spring is the source of the stream of the river <prn id='Q15205042'>Lymax</prn> neither saw it himself nor spoke to a man who had done so. But I did both. We saw the river actually flowing, and the water of the spring on Mount <pl id='Q15209931'>Cotilius</pl> running no long way, and within a short distance disappearing altogether. It did not, however, occur to me to take pains to discover where in <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl> the source of the <prn id='Q15205042'>Lymax</prn> is. Beyond the sanctuary of <pl id='Q38278862'>Apollo Epikourios</pl> is a place named <pl id='Q38282420'>Cotilum</pl>, and in Cotilum is an <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>. She also has a temple, the roof of which is now gone, and an image of the goddess. </p>
<p id='8.42.1'><b>8.42.1</b> The second mountain, Mount <pl id='Q24896427'>Elaius</pl>, is some thirty stades away from <pl id='Q7623270'>Phigalia</pl>, and has a cave sacred to <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> surnamed <prn id='Q107247911'>Melaine</prn> (Black). The <pl id='Q7623270'>Phigalians</pl> accept the account of the people of <pl id='Q1142954'>Thelpusa</pl> about the mating of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> and <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>, but they assert that <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> gave birth, not to a <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn>, but to <prn id='Q1146978'>Despoina</prn>, as the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> call her. </p>
<p id='8.42.2'><b>8.42.2</b> Afterwards, they say, angry with <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> and grieved at the rape of <prn id='Q45967'>Persephone</prn>, she put on black apparel and shut herself up in this cavern for a long time. But when all the fruits of the earth were perishing, and the human race dying yet more through famine, no god, it seemed, knew where <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> was in hiding, </p>
<p id='8.42.3'><b>8.42.3</b> until <prn id='Q132582'>Pan</prn>, they say, visited <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl>. Roaming from mountain to mountain as he hunted, he came at last to Mount <pl id='Q24896427'>Elaius</pl> and spied <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>, the state she was in and the clothes she wore. So <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> learnt this from <prn id='Q132582'>Pan</prn>, and sent the <prn id='Q180287'>Fates</prn> to <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>, who listened to the <prn id='Q180287'>Fates</prn> and laid aside her wrath, moderating her grief as well. For these reasons, the <pl id='Q7623270'>Phigalians</pl> say, they concluded that this cavern was sacred to <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> and set up in it a wooden image. </p>
<p id='8.42.4'><b>8.42.4</b> The image, they say, was made after this fashion. It was seated on a rock, like to a woman in all respects save the head. She had the head and hair of a <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn>, and there grew out of her head images of <prn id='Q2102'>serpents</prn> and other beasts. Her tunic reached right to her feet; on one of her hands was a <prn id='Q7369'>dolphin</prn>, on the other a dove. Now why they had the <prn id='Q693222'>xoanon</prn> made after this fashion is plain to any intelligent man who is learned in traditions. They say that they named her Black because the goddess had black apparel. </p>
<p id='8.42.5'><b>8.42.5</b> They cannot relate either who made this <prn id='Q693222'>xoanon</prn> or how it caught fire. But the old image was destroyed, and the <pl id='Q7623270'>Phigalians</pl> gave the goddess no fresh image, while they neglected for the most part her festivals and sacrifices, until the barrenness fell on the land. Then they went as suppliants to the <prn id='Q220344'>Pythian priestess</prn> and received this response: </p>
<p id='8.42.6'><b>8.42.6</b> <pl id='Q60791680'>Azanian</pl> Arcadians, acorn-eaters, who dwell In <pl id='Q7623270'>Phigaleia</pl>, the cave that hid <prn id='Q40730'>Deo</prn>, who bare a <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn>, You have come to learn a cure for grievous famine, Who alone have twice been nomads, alone have twice lived on wild fruits. It was <prn id='Q40730'>Deo</prn> who made you cease from pasturing, <prn id='Q40730'>Deo</prn> who made you pasture again After being binders of corn and eaters of cakes, Because she was deprived of privileges and ancient honors given by men of former times. And soon will she make you eat each other and feed on your children, Unless you appease her anger with libations offered by all your people, And adorn with divine honors the nook of the cave.” </p>
<p id='8.42.7'><b>8.42.7</b> When the <pl id='Q7623270'>Phigalians</pl> heard the oracle that was brought back, they held <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> in greater honor than before, and particularly they persuaded <prn id='Q635170'>Onatas</prn> of <pl id='Q191082'>Aegina</pl>, son of <prn id='Q1387790'>Micon</prn>, to make them an image of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> at a price. The <pl id='Q18986'>Pergamenes</pl> have a bronze <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> made by this <prn id='Q635170'>Onatas</prn>, a most wonderful marvel both for its size and workmanship. This man then, about two generations after the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl> invasion of Greece, made the <pl id='Q7623270'>Phigalians</pl> an image of bronze, guided partly by a picture or copy of the ancient wooden image which he discovered, but mostly (so goes the story) by a vision that he saw in dreams. As to the date, I have the following evidence to produce. </p>
<p id='8.42.8'><b>8.42.8</b> At the time when <prn id='Q129165'>Xerxes</prn> crossed over into Europe, <prn id='Q468608'>Gelon</prn> the son of <prn id='Q3809562'>Deinomenes</prn> was despot of <pl id='Q4420718'>Syracuse</pl> and of the rest of <pl id='Q4951156'>Sicily</pl> besides. When <prn id='Q468608'>Gelon</prn> died, the kingdom devolved on his brother <prn id='Q335634'>Hieron</prn>. <prn id='Q335634'>Hieron</prn> died before he could dedicate to <prn id='Q106460486'>Olympian</prn> <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> the offerings he had vowed for his victories in the chariot-race, and so <prn id='Q3809562'>Deinomenes</prn> his son paid the debt for his father. </p>
<p id='8.42.9'><b>8.42.9</b> These too are works of <prn id='Q635170'>Onatas</prn>, and there are two inscriptions at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>. The one over the offering is this: “Having won victories in thy grand games, <prn id='Q106460486'>Olympian</prn> <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, Once with the four-horse chariot, twice with the race-horse, <prn id='Q335634'>Hieron</prn> bestowed on thee these gifts: his son dedicated them, <prn id='Q3707980'>Deinomenes</prn>, as a memorial to his <pl id='Q4420718'>Syracusan</pl> father.” </p>
<p id='8.42.10'><b>8.42.10</b> The other inscription is: “<prn id='Q635170'>Onatas</prn>, son of <prn id='Q1387790'>Micon</prn>, fashioned me, Who had his home in the island of <pl id='Q191082'>Aegina</pl>.” <prn id='Q635170'>Onatas</prn> was contemporary with <prn id='Q174532'>Hegias</prn> of <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> and <prn id='Q452536'>Ageladas</prn> of <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.42.11'><b>8.42.11</b> It was mainly to see this <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> that I came to <pl id='Q7623270'>Phigalia</pl>. I offered no burnt sacrifice to the goddess, that being a custom of the natives. But the rule for sacrifice by private persons, and at the annual sacrifice by the community of <pl id='Q7623270'>Phigalia</pl>, is to offer grapes and other cultivated fruits, with honeycombs and raw wool still full of its grease. These they place on the altar built before the cave, afterwards pouring oil over them. </p>
<p id='8.42.12'><b>8.42.12</b> They have a priestess who performs the rites, and with her is the youngest of their “sacrificers,” as they are called, who are citizens, three in number. There is a grove of oaks around the cave, and a cold spring rises from the earth. The image made by <prn id='Q635170'>Onatas</prn> no longer existed in my time, and most of the <pl id='Q7623270'>Phigalians</pl> were ignorant that it had ever existed at all. </p>
<p id='8.42.13'><b>8.42.13</b> The oldest, however, of the inhabitants I met said that three generations before his time some stones had fallen on the image out of the roof; these crushed the image, destroying it utterly. Indeed, in the roof I could still discern plainly where the stones had broken away. </p>
<p id='8.43.1'><b>8.43.1</b> My story next requires me to describe whatever is notable at <pl id='Q11939941'>Pallantium</pl>, and the reason why the emperor <prn id='Q1429'>Antoninus</prn> the first turned it from a village to a city, giving its inhabitants liberty and freedom from taxation. </p>
<p id='8.43.2'><b>8.43.2</b> Well, the story is that the wisest man and the best soldier among the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> was one <prn id='Q837699'>Evander</prn>, whose mother was a nymph, a daughter of the <pl id='Q1462727'>Ladon</pl>, while his father was <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn>. Sent out to establish a colony at the head of a company of <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> from <pl id='Q11939941'>Pallantium</pl>, he founded a city on the banks of the river <pl id='Q13712'>Tiber</pl>. That part of modern <pl id='Q18287233'>Rome</pl>, which once was the home of <prn id='Q837699'>Evander</prn> and the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> who accompanied him, got the name of <pl id='Q200642'>Pallantium</pl> in memory of the city in <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl>. Afterwards the name was changed by omitting the letters L and N. These are the reasons why the emperor bestowed boons upon <pl id='Q11939941'>Pallantium</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.43.3'><b>8.43.3</b> <prn id='Q1429'>Antoninus</prn>, the benefactor of <pl id='Q11939941'>Pallantium</pl>, never willingly involved the Romans in war; but when the Moors (who form the greatest part of the independent <pl id='Q2370577'>Libyans</pl>, being nomads, and more formidable enemies than even the <pl id='Q845909'>Scythians</pl> in that they wandered, not on wagons, but on horseback with their womenfolk), when these, I say, began an unprovoked war, he drove them from all their country, forcing them to flee to the extreme parts of <pl id='Q2370577'>Libya</pl>, right up to Mount A394 and to the people living on it. </p>
<p id='8.43.4'><b>8.43.4</b> He also took away from the <prn id='Q500393'>Brigantes</prn> in <pl id='Q185103'>Britain</pl> the greater part of their territory, because they too had begun an unprovoked war on the province of Genunia, a Roman dependency. The cities of <pl id='Q18927'>Lycia</pl> and of <pl id='Q193214'>Caria</pl>, along with <pl id='Q187027'>Cos</pl> and <pl id='Q13533316'>Rhodes</pl>, were overthrown by a violent earthquake that smote them. These cities also were restored by the emperor <prn id='Q1429'>Antoninus</prn>, who was keenly anxious to rebuild them, and devoted vast sums to this task. As to his gifts of money to Greeks, and to such non-Greeks as needed it, and his buildings in Greece, <pl id='Q620874'>Ionia</pl>, <pl id='Q6343'>Carthage</pl> and <pl id='Q13415123'>Syria</pl>, others have written of them most exactly. </p>
<p id='8.43.5'><b>8.43.5</b> But there is also another memorial of himself left by this emperor. There was a certain law whereby provincials who were themselves of Roman citizenship, while their children were considered of Greek nationality, were forced either to leave their property to strangers or let it increase the wealth of the emperor. <prn id='Q1429'>Antoninus</prn> permitted all such to give to the children their heritage, choosing rather to show himself benevolent than to retain a law that swelled his riches. This emperor the Romans called <prn id='Q1429'>Pius</prn>, because he showed himself to be a most religious man. </p>
<p id='8.43.6'><b>8.43.6</b> In my opinion he might also be justly called by the same title as the elder <prn id='Q8423'>Cyrus</prn>, who was styled Father of Men. He left to succeed him a son of the same name. This <prn id='Q1430'>Antoninus</prn> the second brought retribution both on the Germans, the most numerous and warlike barbarians in Europe, and also on the <pl id='Q2528503'>Sarmatian</pl> nation, both of whom had been guilty of beginning a war of aggression. </p>
<p id='8.44.1'><b>8.44.1</b> To complete my account of <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl> I have only to describe the road from <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl> to <pl id='Q11939941'>Pallantium</pl> and <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl>, which also takes us as far as what is called the Dyke. On this road is a suburb named <pl id='Q39081796'>Ladoceia</pl> after Ladocus, the son of <prn id='Q2993260'>Echemus</prn>, and after it is the site of what was in old times the city of <pl id='Q39081796'>Haemoniae</pl>. Its founder was <prn id='Q3144947'>Haemon</prn> the son of <prn id='Q501667'>Lycaon</prn>, and the name of the place has remained <pl id='Q39081796'>Haemoniae</pl> to this day. </p>
<p id='8.44.2'><b>8.44.2</b> After <pl id='Q39081796'>Haemoniae</pl> on the right of the road are some noteworthy remains of the city of <pl id='Q7101662'>Oresthasium</pl>, especially the pillars of a sanctuary of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, which still are there. The surname of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> is Priestess. On the straight road from <pl id='Q39081796'>Haemoniae</pl> is a place called <pl id='Q60791607'>Aphrodisium</pl>, and after it another, called <pl id='Q60791626'>Athenaeum</pl>. On the left of it is a temple of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> with a stone image in it. </p>
<p id='8.44.3'><b>8.44.3</b> About twenty stades away from <pl id='Q60791626'>Athenaeum</pl> are ruins of <pl id='Q60791566'>Asea</pl>, and the hill that once was the acropolis has traces of fortifications to this day. Some five stades from <pl id='Q60791566'>Asea</pl> are the sources of the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl> and of the <pl id='Q119152'>Eurotas</pl>, the former a little distance from the road, the latter just by the road itself. Near the source of the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl> is a temple of the <prn id='Q334486'>Mother of the Gods</prn> without a roof, and two <prn id='Q140'>lions</prn> made of stone. </p>
<p id='8.44.4'><b>8.44.4</b> The waters of the <pl id='Q119152'>Eurotas</pl> mingle with the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl>, and the united streams flow on for some twenty stades. Then they fall into a chasm, and the <pl id='Q119152'>Eurotas</pl> comes again to the surface in the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> territory, the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl> at Pegae (springs) in the land of <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl>. From <pl id='Q60791566'>Asea</pl> is an ascent up <pl id='Q112301773'>Mount Boreion</pl>, and on the top of the mountain are traces of a sanctuary. It is said that the sanctuary was built in honor of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> <prn id='Q2303797'>Saviour</prn> and <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> [<pl id='Q111082690'>temple foundations</pl>] by <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn> after his return from <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl> . </p>
<p id='8.44.5'><b>8.44.5</b> What is called the Dyke [chôma] is the boundary between <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl> on the one hand and <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl> and <pl id='Q11939941'>Pallantium</pl> on the other. The plain of <pl id='Q11939941'>Pallantium</pl> you reach by turning aside to the left from the Dyke. In <pl id='Q11939941'>Pallantium</pl> is a temple with two stone images, one of <prn id='Q2048018'>Pallas</prn>, the other of <prn id='Q2705204'>Evander</prn>. There is also a sanctuary of <prn id='Q45967'>Kore</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>, and not far away is a statue of <prn id='Q131169'>Polybius</prn>. The hill above the city was of old used as a acropolis. On the crest of the hill there still remains a sanctuary of certain gods. </p>
<p id='8.44.6'><b>8.44.6</b> Their surname is the Pure, and here it is customary to take the most solemn oaths. The names of the gods either they do not know, or knowing will not divulge; but it might be inferred that they were called Pure because <prn id='Q2048018'>Pallas</prn> did not sacrifice to them after the same fashion as his father sacrificed to <prn id='Q106301499'>Lycaean</prn> <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.44.7'><b>8.44.7</b> On the right of the so-called Dyke lies the <pl id='Q60791893'>Manthuric</pl> plain. The plain is on the borders of <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl>, stretching just about fifty stades to that city. On the right of the road is a small mountain called Mount Cresius, on which stands the sanctuary of <prn id='Q23680016'>Aphneius</prn>. For <prn id='Q40901'>Ares</prn>, the <pl id='Q645234'>Tegeans</pl> say, mated with <prn id='Q4688387'>Aerope</prn>, daughter of <prn id='Q1509662'>Cepheus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q1536527'>Aleus</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.44.8'><b>8.44.8</b> She died in giving birth to a child, who clung to his mother even when she was dead, and sucked great abundance of milk from her breasts. Now this took place by the will of <prn id='Q40901'>Ares</prn>, and because of it they name the god <prn id='Q23680016'>Aphneius</prn> (Abundant); but the name given to the child was, it is said, AeropusYY. There is on the way to <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl> a fountain called Leuconian. They say that <prn id='Q3606201'>Apheidas</prn> was the father of <prn id='Q106462936'>Leucone</prn>, and not far from <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl> is her tomb. </p>
<p id='8.45.1'><b>8.45.1</b> The <pl id='Q645234'>Tegeans</pl> say that in the time of <prn id='Q3982573'>Tegeates</prn>, son of <prn id='Q501667'>Lycaon</prn>, only the district got its name from him, and that the inhabitants dwelt in demes, Gareatae, <pl id='Q60790436'>Phylacenses</pl>, <pl id='Q59148716'>Caryatae</pl>, Corythenses, Potachidae, Oeatae, <pl id='Q60791893'>Manthyrenses</pl>, Echeuethenses. But in the reign of <prn id='Q3606201'>Apheidas</prn> a ninth deme was added to them, namely ApheidantYY. Of the modern city <prn id='Q1536527'>Aleus</prn> was founder. </p>
<p id='8.45.2'><b>8.45.2</b> Besides the exploits shared by the <pl id='Q645234'>Tegeans</pl> with the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl>, which include the <prn id='Q42937'>Trojan War</prn>, the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl> wars and the battle at <pl id='Q1227119'>Dipaea</pl> with the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, the <pl id='Q645234'>Tegeans</pl> have, besides the deeds already mentioned, the following claims of their own to fame. <prn id='Q2446902'>Ancaeus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q609650'>Lycurgus</prn>, though wounded, stood up to the <prn id='Q654379'>Calydonian Boar</prn>, which <prn id='Q190323'>Atalanta</prn> shot at, being the first to hit the beast. For this feat she received, as a prize for valor, the head and hide of the <prn id='Q654379'>boar</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.45.3'><b>8.45.3</b> When the <prn id='Q828084'>Heracleidae</prn> returned to the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl>, <prn id='Q2993260'>Echemus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q4058052'>Aeropus</prn>, a <pl id='Q645234'>Tegean</pl>, fought a duel with <prn id='Q847268'>Hyllus</prn>, and overcame him in the fight. The <pl id='Q645234'>Tegeans</pl> again were the first <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> to overcome <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>; when invaded they defeated their enemies and took most of them prisoners. </p>
<p id='8.45.4'><b>8.45.4</b> The ancient sanctuary of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> <prn id='Q1857789'>Alea</prn> was made for the <pl id='Q645234'>Tegeans</pl> by <prn id='Q1536527'>Aleus</prn>. Later on the <pl id='Q645234'>Tegeans</pl> set up for the goddess a large <pl id='Q3983230'>temple</pl>, worth seeing. The sanctuary was utterly destroyed by a fire which suddenly broke out when <prn id='Q108823623'>Diophantus was archon</prn> [395/4 BCE] at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, in the second year of the <prn id='Q57337785'>ninety-sixth Olympiad</prn>, at which <prn id='Q3362836'>Eupolemus</prn> of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> won the foot-race. </p>
<p id='8.45.5'><b>8.45.5</b> The modern <pl id='Q3983230'>temple</pl> is far superior to all other temples in the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl> on many grounds, especially for its size. Its first row of pillars is <prn id='Q192664'>Doric</prn>, and the next to it <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthian</pl>; also, inside [outside] the temple, stand columns of the <prn id='Q189548'>Ionic order</prn>. I discovered that its architect was <prn id='Q309579'>Scopas</prn> the <pl id='Q65040323'>Parian</pl>, who made images in many places of ancient Greece, and some besides in <pl id='Q620874'>Ionia</pl> and <pl id='Q193214'>Caria</pl>. </p>

<p id='8.46.1'><b>8.46.1</b> The ancient image of <pl id='Q3983230'>Athena Alea</pl>, and with it the tusks of the <prn id='Q654379'>Calydonian Boar</prn>, were carried away by the Roman emperor <prn id='Q1405'>Augustus</prn> after his defeat of <prn id='Q51673'>Antonius</prn> and his allies, among whom were all the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> except the <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineans</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.46.2'><b>8.46.2</b> It is clear that <prn id='Q1405'>Augustus</prn> was not the first to carry away from the vanquished votive offerings and images of gods, but was only following an old precedent. For when <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl> was taken and the Greeks were dividing up the spoils, <prn id='Q1060267'>Sthenelus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q833806'>Capaneus</prn> was given the wooden image of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q103020456'>Herkeios</prn>; and many years later, when <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn> were migrating to <pl id='Q4951156'>Sicily</pl>, <prn id='Q3618680'>Antiphemus</prn> the founder of <pl id='Q58008539'>Gela</pl>, after the sack of <pl id='Q23640647'>Omphace</pl>, a town of the <prn id='Q952123'>Sicanians</prn>, removed to <pl id='Q58008539'>Gela</pl> an image made by <prn id='Q134756'>Daedalus</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.46.3'><b>8.46.3</b> <prn id='Q129165'>Xerxes</prn>, too, the son of <prn id='Q44387'>Dareius</prn>, the king of <pl id='Q3746183'>Persia</pl>, apart from the spoil he carried away from the city of <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, took besides, as we know, from <pl id='Q475497'>Brauron</pl> the image of Brauronian <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, and furthermore, accusing the <pl id='Q169460'>Milesians</pl> of cowardice in a naval engagement against the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> in Greek waters, carried away from them the bronze <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> at <pl id='Q671358'>Branchidae</pl>. This it was to be the lot of <prn id='Q184176'>Seleucus</prn> afterwards to restore to the <pl id='Q169460'>Milesians</pl>, but the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> down to the present still retain the images they took from <pl id='Q217379'>Tiryns</pl>; one, a wooden image, is by the <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn>, the other is kept in the sanctuary of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> Lykios. </p>
<p id='8.46.4'><b>8.46.4</b> Again, the people of <pl id='Q615449'>Cyzicus</pl>, compelling the people of <pl id='Q950908'>Proconnesus</pl> by war to live at <pl id='Q615449'>Cyzicus</pl>, took away from <pl id='Q950908'>Proconnesus</pl> an image of Mother <pl id='Q5278019'>Dindymene</pl>. The image is of gold, and its face is made of hippopotamus teeth instead of ivory. So the emperor <prn id='Q1405'>Augustus</prn> only followed a custom in vogue among the Greeks and barbarians from of old. The image of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> <prn id='Q1857789'>Alea</prn> at <pl id='Q18287233'>Rome</pl> is as you enter the <pl id='Q770797'>Forum</pl> made by <prn id='Q1405'>Augustus</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.46.5'><b>8.46.5</b> Here then it has been set up, made throughout of ivory, the work of <prn id='Q2327459'>Endoeus</prn>. Those in charge of the curiosities say that one of the <prn id='Q654379'>boar</prn>'s tusks has broken off; the remaining one is kept in the gardens of the emperor, in a sanctuary of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>, and is about half a fathom long. </p>
<p id='8.47.1'><b>8.47.1</b> The present image at <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl> was brought from the deme of the <pl id='Q60791893'>Manthyrenses</pl>, and among them it had the surname of <prn id='Q20100719'>Hippia</prn> (Horse Goddess). According to their account, when the battle of the gods and giants took place the goddess drove the chariot and <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn> against <prn id='Q845112'>Enceladus</prn>. Yet this goddess too has come to receive the name of <prn id='Q1857789'>Alea</prn> among the Greeks generally and the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesians</pl> themselves. On one side of the image of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> stands <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>, on the other <prn id='Q202257'>Health</prn>, works of <prn id='Q309579'>Scopas</prn> of <pl id='Q65040323'>Paros</pl> in <pl id='Q1125206'>Pentelic</pl> marble. </p>
<p id='8.47.2'><b>8.47.2</b> Of the votive offerings in the temple these are the most notable. There is the hide of the <prn id='Q654379'>Calydonian Boar</prn>, rotted by age and by now altogether without bristles. Hanging up are the fetters, except such as have been destroyed by rust, worn by the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> prisoners when they dug the plain of <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl>. There have been dedicated a sacred couch of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, a portrait painting of <prn id='Q760213'>Auge</prn>, and the shield of <prn id='Q10326673'>Marpessa</prn>, surnamed Choera, a woman of <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl>; </p>
<p id='8.47.3'><b>8.47.3</b> of <prn id='Q10326673'>Marpessa</prn> I shall make mention later. The priest of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> is a boy; I do not know how long his priesthood lasts, but it must be before, and not after, puberty. The altar for the goddess was made, they say, by <prn id='Q602258'>Melampus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q482134'>Amythaon</prn>. Represented on the altar are <prn id='Q108419'>Rhea</prn> and the nymph Oenoe holding the baby <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>. On either side are four figures: on one, <prn id='Q18412032'>Glauce</prn>, <prn id='Q1984901'>Neda</prn>, <prn id='Q15054706'>Theisoa</prn> and <prn id='Q29686726'>Anthracia</prn>; on the other <prn id='Q3147753'>Ide</prn>, <prn id='Q62058069'>Hagno</prn>, <prn id='Q2647446'>Alcinoe</prn> and Phrixa. There are also images of the <prn id='Q66016'>Muses</prn> and of <prn id='Q102884'>Memory</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.47.4'><b>8.47.4</b> Not far from the temple is a stadium formed by a mound of earth, where they celebrate games, one festival called <prn id='Q16737288'>Aleaea</prn> after <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, the other Halotia (Capture Festival) because they captured the greater part of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> alive in the battle. To the north of the temple is a fountain, and at this fountain they say that <prn id='Q760213'>Auge</prn> was outraged by <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, therein differing from the account of <prn id='Q760213'>Auge</prn> in <prn id='Q242270'>Hecataeus</prn>. Some three stades away from the fountain is a temple of <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> A109;A108;A107. </p>
<p id='8.47.5'><b>8.47.5</b> There is at <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl> another sanctuary of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, namely of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> Poliatis (Keeper of the City) into which a priest enters once in each year. This sanctuary they name Eryma (Defence) saying that <prn id='Q1509662'>Cepheus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q1536527'>Aleus</prn>, received from <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> a boon, that <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl> should never be captured while time shall endure, adding that the goddess cut off some of the hair of <prn id='Q160730'>Medusa</prn> and gave it to him as a guard to the city. </p>
<p id='8.47.6'><b>8.47.6</b> Their story about <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, the same as is called <prn id='Q62135396'>Hegemone</prn> (Leader), is as follows. <prn id='Q106436086'>Aristomelidas</prn>, despot of <pl id='Q1855083'>Orchomenus</pl> in <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl>, fell in love with a <pl id='Q645234'>Tegean</pl> maiden, and, getting her somehow or other into his power, entrusted her to the keeping of ChroniusYY. The girl, before she was delivered up to the despot, killed herself for fear and shame, and <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> in a vision stirred up ChroniusYY against <prn id='Q106436086'>Aristomelidas</prn>. He slew the despot, fled to <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl>, and made a sanctuary for <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.48.1'><b>8.48.1</b> The agora is in shape very like a brick, and in it is a temple of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> called “in brick,” with a stone image. There are two slabs; on one are represented in relief AntiphaneYY, A1209;A1210, Tyronidas and Pyrrhias1, who made laws for the <pl id='Q645234'>Tegeans</pl>, and down to this day receive honors for it from them. On the other slab is represented <prn id='Q16559355'>Iasius</prn>, holding a <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn>, and carrying in his right hand a branch of palm. It is said that <prn id='Q16559355'>Iasius</prn> won a horse-race at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>, at the time when <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> the <pl id='Q11225429'>Theban</pl> celebrated the <pl id='Q38888'>Olympian</pl> festival. </p>
<p id='8.48.2'><b>8.48.2</b> The reason why at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> the victor receives a crown of wild-olive I have already explained in my account of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>; why at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> the crown is of bay I shall make plain later. At the <pl id='Q16600469'>Isthmus</pl> the pine, and at <pl id='Q748108'>Nemea</pl> celery became the prize to commemorate the sufferings of <prn id='Q738007'>Palaemon</prn> and <prn id='Q1419140'>Archemorus</prn>. At most games, however, is given a crown of palm, and at all a palm is placed in the right hand of the victor. </p>
<p id='8.48.3'><b>8.48.3</b> The origin of the custom is said to be that <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>, on his return from <pl id='Q4752820'>Crete</pl>, held games in <pl id='Q106802906'>Delos</pl> in honor of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, and crowned the victors with palm. Such, it is said, was the origin of the custom. The palm in <pl id='Q106802906'>Delos</pl> is mentioned by <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> in the passage where <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn> supplicates the daughter of <prn id='Q496595'>Alcinous</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.48.4'><b>8.48.4</b> There is also an image of <prn id='Q40901'>Ares</prn> in the marketplace of <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl>. Carved in relief on a slab it is called <prn id='Q5625156'>Gynaecothoenas</prn> (He who entertains women). At the time of the <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconian</pl> war, when <prn id='Q176022'>Charillus</prn> king of <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl> made the first invasion, the women armed themselves and lay in ambush under the hill they call today Phylactris (Sentry Hill). When the armies met and the men on either side were performing many remarkable exploits, </p>
<p id='8.48.5'><b>8.48.5</b> the women, they say, came on the scene and put the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> to flight. <prn id='Q10326673'>Marpessa</prn>, surnamed Choera, surpassed, they say, the other women in daring, while <prn id='Q176022'>Charillus</prn> himself was one of the <pl id='Q5690'>Spartan</pl> prisoners. The story goes on to say that he was set free without ransom, swore to the <pl id='Q645234'>Tegeans</pl> that the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> would never again attack <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl>, and then broke his oath; that the women offered to <prn id='Q40901'>Ares</prn> a sacrifice of victory on their own account without the men, and gave to the men no share in the meat of the victim. For this reason <prn id='Q40901'>Ares</prn> got his surname. </p>
<p id='8.48.6'><b>8.48.6</b> There is also an altar of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> Teleius (Full-grown), with a square image, a shape of which the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> seem to me to be exceedingly fond. There are also here tombs of <prn id='Q3982573'>Tegeates</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q501667'>Lycaon</prn>, and of <prn id='Q3854794'>Maera</prn>, the wife of <prn id='Q3982573'>Tegeates</prn>. They say that <prn id='Q3854794'>Maera</prn> was a daughter of <prn id='Q130818'>Atlas</prn>, and <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> makes mention of her in the passage where <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn> tells to <prn id='Q496595'>Alcinous</prn> his journey to <pl id='Q1521549'>Hades</pl>, and of those whose ghosts he beheld there. </p>
<p id='8.48.7'><b>8.48.7</b> The <pl id='Q645234'>Tegeans</pl> surname <prn id='Q94066'>Eileithyia</prn>, a temple of whom, with art image, they have in their agora, <prn id='Q760213'>Auge</prn> on her knees, saying that <prn id='Q1536527'>Aleus</prn> handed over his daughter to <prn id='Q833826'>Nauplius</prn> with the order to take and drown her in the sea. As she was being carried along, they say, she fell on her knees and so gave birth to her son, at the place where is the sanctuary of <prn id='Q94066'>Eileithyia</prn>. This story is different from another, that <prn id='Q760213'>Auge</prn> was brought to bed without her father's knowing it, and that <prn id='Q916442'>Telephus</prn> was exposed on Mount <pl id='Q833949'>Parthenius</pl>, the abandoned child being suckled by a deer. This account is equally current among the people of <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.48.8'><b>8.48.8</b> Close to the sanctuary of <prn id='Q94066'>Eileithyia</prn> is an altar of <prn id='Q93172'>Earth</prn>, next to which is a slab of white marble. On this is carved <prn id='Q131169'>Polybius</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q2065138'>Lycortas</prn>, while on another slab is <prn id='Q1325009'>Elatus</prn>, one of the sons of <prn id='Q606422'>Arcas</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.49.1'><b>8.49.1</b> Not far from the agora is a theater, and near it are pedestals of bronze statues, but the statues themselves no longer exist. On one pedestal is an elegiac inscription that the statue is that of <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn>. The memory of this <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn> is most carefully cherished by the Greeks, both for the wisdom he showed and for his many brave achievements. </p>
<p id='8.49.2'><b>8.49.2</b> His father <prn id='Q88466293'>Craugis</prn> was as nobly born as any <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadian</pl> of <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl>, but he died while <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn> was still a baby, and CleanderYY of <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineia</pl> became his guardian. This man was an exile from <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineia</pl>, resident in <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl> because of his misfortunes at home, and his house and that of <prn id='Q88466293'>Craugis</prn> had ties of guest-friendship. Among the teachers of <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn>, they say, were <prn id='Q11916862'>Megalophanes</prn> and <prn id='Q29052601'>Ecdelus</prn>, pupils, it is said, of <prn id='Q73527'>Arcesilaus</prn> of <pl id='Q60791979'>Pitane</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.49.3'><b>8.49.3</b> In size and strength of body no <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesian</pl> was his superior, but he was ugly of countenance. He scorned training for the prizes of the games, but he worked the land he owned and did not neglect to clear it of wild beasts. They say that he read books of scholars of repute among the Greeks, stories of wars, and all that taught him anything of strategy. He wished to model his whole life on <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn>, his wisdom and his achievements, but could not rise to his height in every respect. For the temper of <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn> was calm and, in particular, free from anger, but the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadian</pl> was somewhat passionate. </p>
<p id='8.49.4'><b>8.49.4</b> When <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl> was captured by <prn id='Q310811'>Cleomenes</prn>, <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn> was not dismayed by the unexpected disaster, but led safely to <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl> about two-thirds of the men of military age, along with the women and children, the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> being at that time friendly allies. To some of those who made good their escape <prn id='Q310811'>Cleomenes</prn> offered terms, saying that he was beginning to repent his crime, and would treat with the <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolitans</pl> if they returned home; but <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn> induced the citizens at a meeting to win a return home by force of arms, and to refuse to negotiate or make a truce. </p>
<p id='8.49.5'><b>8.49.5</b> When the battle had joined with the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> under <prn id='Q310811'>Cleomenes</prn> at <pl id='Q59431661'>Sellasia</pl>, in which <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> and <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> from all the cities took part, along with <prn id='Q108816'>Antigonus</prn> at the head of a <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonian</pl> army, <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn> served with the cavalry. But when he saw that the infantry would be the decisive factor in the engagement, he voluntarily fought on foot, showed conspicuous daring, and was pierced through both thighs by one of the enemy. </p>
<p id='8.49.6'><b>8.49.6</b> Although so seriously impeded, he bent in his knees and forced himself forward, so that he actually broke the spear by the movement of his legs. After the defeat of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> under <prn id='Q310811'>Cleomenes</prn>, <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn> returned to the camp, where the surgeons pulled out from one thigh the spike, from the other the blade. When <prn id='Q108816'>Antigonus</prn> learned of his valor and saw it, he was anxious to take <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn> to <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.49.7'><b>8.49.7</b> But <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn> was not likely to care much about <prn id='Q108816'>Antigonus</prn>. Sailing across to <pl id='Q4752820'>Crete</pl>, where a civil war was raging, he put himself at the head of a band of mercenaries. Going back to <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl>, he was at once chosen by the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> to command the cavalry, and he turned them into the finest cavalry in Greece. In the battle at the river <pl id='Q3362574'>Larisus</pl> between the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> with their allies and the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> with the <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolians</pl>, who were helping the <pl id='Q6536845'>Eleans</pl> on grounds of kinship, <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn> first killed with his own hand <prn id='Q106434574'>Demophantus</prn>, the leader of the opposing cavalry, and then turned to flight all the mounted troops of <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolia</pl> and <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.50.1'><b>8.50.1</b> As the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> now turned their gaze on <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn> and placed in him all their hopes, he succeeded in changing the equipment of those serving in their infantry.

<p id='8.50.2'><b>8.50.2</b> When <prn id='Q1269430'>Machanidas</prn> the upstart became despot of <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl>, and war began once again between that city under <prn id='Q1269430'>Machanidas</prn> and the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn> commanded the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaean</pl> forces. A battle took place at <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineia</pl>. The light troops of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> overcame the light-armed of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, and <prn id='Q1269430'>Machanidas</prn> pressed hard on the fugitives. <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn>, however, with the phalanx of infantry put to flight the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> men-at-arms, met <prn id='Q1269430'>Machanidas</prn> returning from the pursuit and killed him. The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> were unfortunate in the battle, but their good fortune more than compensated for their defeat, for they were delivered from their despot. </p>
<p id='8.50.3'><b>8.50.3</b> Not long afterwards the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> celebrated the <prn id='Q527006'>Nemean games</prn>, and <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn> chanced to be present at the competition of the harpists. <prn id='Q106434995'>Pylades</prn>, a man of <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl>, the most famous harpist of his time, who had won a <pl id='Q682558'>Pythian</pl> victory, was then singing The Persians, an ode of <prn id='Q669691'>Timotheus</prn> the <pl id='Q169460'>Milesian</pl>. When he had begun the song: “Who to Greece gives the great and glorious jewel of freedom”. The audience of Greeks looked at <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn> and by their clapping signified that the song applied to him. I am told that a similar thing happened to <prn id='Q179552'>Themistocles</prn> at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>, for the audience there rose to do him honor. </p>
<p id='8.50.4'><b>8.50.4</b> But <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q59734'>Demetrius</prn>, king of <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl>, who poisoned <prn id='Q317331'>Aratus</prn> of <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl>, sent men to <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl> with orders to murder <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn>. The attempt failed, and <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn> incurred the hatred of all Greece. The <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> had defeated the <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarians</pl> in battle, and were already climbing the wall of <pl id='Q42307600'>Megara</pl>, when the <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarians</pl> deceived them into thinking that <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn> had come to <pl id='Q42307600'>Megara</pl>. This made the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> so cautious that they went away home, and abandoned their military operation. </p>
<p id='8.50.5'><b>8.50.5</b> In <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl> another despot arose, <prn id='Q312689'>Nabis</prn>, and the first of the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesians</pl> to be attacked by him were the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>. Coming upon them by night, when they by no means were expecting an assault, he took the city except the acropolis; but when on the morrow <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn> arrived with an army, he evacuated <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl> under a truce. </p>
<p id='8.50.6'><b>8.50.6</b> When <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn>'s term of office as general expired, and others were chosen to be generals of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, he again crossed to <pl id='Q4752820'>Crete</pl> and sided with the <pl id='Q1136193'>Gortynians</pl>, who were hard pressed in war. The <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> were wroth with him for his absence; so he returned from <pl id='Q4752820'>Crete</pl> and found that the Romans had begun a war against <prn id='Q312689'>Nabis</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.50.7'><b>8.50.7</b> The Romans had equipped a fleet against <prn id='Q312689'>Nabis</prn>, and <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn> was too enthusiastic to keep out of the quarrel. But being entirely ignorant of nautical affairs he unwittingly embarked on a leaky trireme, so that the Romans and their allies were reminded of the verses of <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>, where in the <prn id='Q1233048'>Catalogue</prn> he remarks on the ignorance of the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> of nautical matters. </p>
<p id='8.50.8'><b>8.50.8</b> A few days after the sea-fight, <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn> and his band, waiting for a moonless night, burnt down the camp of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> at <pl id='Q56398303'>Gythium</pl>. Thereupon <prn id='Q312689'>Nabis</prn> caught <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn> himself and the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> with him in a disadvantageous position. The <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl>, though few in number, were good soldiers, </p>
<p id='8.50.9'><b>8.50.9</b> and <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn>, by changing the order of his line of retreat, caused the strongest positions to be to his advantage and not to that of his enemy. He overcame <prn id='Q312689'>Nabis</prn> in the battle and massacred during the night many of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, so raising yet higher his reputation among the Greeks. </p>
<p id='8.50.10'><b>8.50.10</b> After this <prn id='Q312689'>Nabis</prn> secured from the Romans a truce for a fixed period, but died before this period came to an end, being assassinated by a man of <pl id='Q750313'>Calydon</pl>, who pretended that he had come about an alliance, but was in reality an enemy who had been sent for this very purpose of assassination by the <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolians</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.51.1'><b>8.51.1</b> At this time <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn> flung himself into <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> and forced her to join the <prn id='Q244796'>Achaean League</prn>. Shortly afterwards <prn id='Q349222'>Titus</prn>, the Roman commander in Greece, and <prn id='Q106404170'>Diophanes</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q2066030'>Diaeus</prn>, a <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolitan</pl> who had been elected general of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, attacked <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl>, accusing the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> of rebellion against the Romans. But <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn>, though at the time holding no office, shut the gates against them. </p>
<p id='8.51.2'><b>8.51.2</b> For this reason, and because of his courage shown against both the despots, the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> offered him the house of <prn id='Q312689'>Nabis</prn>, worth more than a hundred talents. But he scorned the wealth, and bade the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> court with gifts, not himself, but those who could persuade the many in the meeting of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> — a suggestion, it is said, directed against <prn id='Q11951871'>Timolaus</prn>. He was again appointed general of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.51.3'><b>8.51.3</b> At this time the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> were involved in civil war, and <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn> expelled from the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl> three hundred who were chiefly responsible for the civil war, sold some three thousand <prn id='Q462484'>Helots</prn>, razed the walls of <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>, and forbade the youths to train in the manner laid down by the laws of <prn id='Q211326'>Lycurgus</prn>, ordering them to follow the training of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaean</pl> youths. The Romans, in course of time, were to restore to the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> the discipline of their native land. </p>
<p id='8.51.4'><b>8.51.4</b> When the Romans under <prn id='Q472433'>Manius</prn> defeated at <pl id='Q194450'>Thermopylae</pl> <prn id='Q3365'>Antiochus</prn> the descendant of <prn id='Q184176'>Seleucus</prn>, named Nicator, and the Syrian army with him, <prn id='Q2064484'>Aristaenus</prn> of <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl> advised the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> to approve the wishes of the Romans in all respects, and to oppose them in nothing. <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn> looked angrily at <prn id='Q2064484'>Aristaenus</prn>, and said that he was hastening on the doom of Greece. <prn id='Q472433'>Manius</prn> wished the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> exiles to return, but <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn> opposed his plan, and only when <prn id='Q472433'>Manius</prn> had gone away did he allow the exiles to be restored. </p>
<p id='8.51.5'><b>8.51.5</b> But, nevertheless, <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn> too was to be punished for his pride. After being appointed commander of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> for the eighth time, he reproached a man of no little distinction for having been captured alive by the enemy. Now at this time the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> had a grievance against the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>, and <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn>, despatching <prn id='Q2065138'>Lycortas</prn> with the army to lay waste the land of the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>, was very anxious two or three days later, in spite of his seventy years and a severe attack of fever, to take his share in the expedition of <prn id='Q2065138'>Lycortas</prn>. He led about sixty horsemen and targeteers. </p>
<p id='8.51.6'><b>8.51.6</b> <prn id='Q2065138'>Lycortas</prn>, however, and his army were already on their way back to their country, having neither suffered great harm nor inflicted it on the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>. <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn>, wounded in the head during the battle, fell from his <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn> and was taken alive to <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl>. A meeting of the assembly was immediately held, at which the most widely divergent opinions were expressed. </p>
<p id='8.51.7'><b>8.51.7</b> <prn id='Q16190826'>Deinocrates</prn>, and all the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> whose wealth made them influential, urged that <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn> should be put to death; but the popular party were keen on saving his life, calling him Father, and more than Father, of all the Greek people. But <prn id='Q16190826'>Deinocrates</prn>, after all, and in spite of <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> opposition, was to bring about the death of <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn>, for he sent poison in to him. </p>
<p id='8.51.8'><b>8.51.8</b> Shortly afterwards <prn id='Q2065138'>Lycortas</prn> gathered a force from <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl> and <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaia</pl> and marched against <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl>. The <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl> populace at once went over to the side of the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl>, and those responsible for the death of <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn> were caught and punished, all except <prn id='Q16190826'>Deinocrates</prn>, who perished by his own hand. The <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> also brought back to <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl> the bones of <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.52.1'><b>8.52.1</b> After this Greece ceased to bear good men. For <prn id='Q210350'>Miltiades</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q14278582'>Cimon</prn>, overcame in battle the foreign invaders who had landed at <pl id='Q31900'>Marathon</pl>, stayed the advance of the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl> army, and so became the first benefactor of all Greece, just as <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q88466293'>Craugis</prn>, was the last. Those who before <prn id='Q210350'>Miltiades</prn> accomplished brilliant deeds, <prn id='Q1052888'>Codrus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q1255043'>Melanthus</prn>, <prn id='Q1463572'>Polydorus</prn> the <pl id='Q5690'>Spartan</pl>, <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenian</pl>, and all the rest, will be seen to have helped each his own country and not Greece as a whole. </p>
<p id='8.52.2'><b>8.52.2</b> Later than <prn id='Q210350'>Miltiades</prn>, <prn id='Q44228'>Leonidas</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q488567'>Anaxandrides</prn>, and <prn id='Q179552'>Themistocles</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q107138602'>Neocles</prn>, repulsed <prn id='Q129165'>Xerxes</prn> from Greece, <prn id='Q179552'>Themistocles</prn> by the two sea-fights, <prn id='Q44228'>Leonidas</prn> by the action at <pl id='Q194450'>Thermopylae</pl>. But <prn id='Q294942'>Aristeides</prn> the son of LysimachuYY, and <prn id='Q314518'>Pausanias</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q718102'>Cleombrotus</prn>, commanders at <pl id='Q204636'>Plataea</pl>, were debarred from being called benefactors of Greece, <prn id='Q314518'>Pausanias</prn> by his subsequent sins, <prn id='Q294942'>Aristeides</prn> by his imposition of tribute on the island Greeks; for before <prn id='Q294942'>Aristeides</prn> all the Greeks were immune from tribute. </p>
<p id='8.52.3'><b>8.52.3</b> <prn id='Q380401'>Xanthippus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q11906465'>Ariphron</prn>, with <prn id='Q360151'>Leotychidas</prn> the king of <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> destroyed the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl> fleet at <pl id='Q1330828'>Mycale</pl>, and with <prn id='Q218102'>Cimon</prn> accomplished many enviable achievements on behalf of the Greeks. But those who took part in the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesian</pl> war against <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, especially the most distinguished of them, might be said to be murderers, almost wreckers, of Greece. </p>
<p id='8.52.4'><b>8.52.4</b> When the Greek nation was reduced to a miserable condition, it recovered under the efforts of <prn id='Q363832'>Conon</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q713679'>Timotheus</prn>, and of <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q3395640'>Polymnis</prn>, who drove out the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> garrisons and governors, and put down the boards of ten, <prn id='Q363832'>Conon</prn> from the islands and coasts, <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn> from the cities of the interior. By founding cities too, of no small fame, <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl> and <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadian</pl> <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl>, <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn> made Greece more famous. </p>
<p id='8.52.5'><b>8.52.5</b> I reckon <prn id='Q183109'>Leosthenes</prn> also and <prn id='Q317331'>Aratus</prn> benefactors of all the Greeks. <prn id='Q183109'>Leosthenes</prn>, in spite of <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn>'s opposition, brought back safe by sea to Greece the force of Greek mercenaries in <pl id='Q3746183'>Persia</pl>, about fifty thousand in number, who had descended to the coast. As for <prn id='Q317331'>Aratus</prn>, I have related his exploits in my history of <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.52.6'><b>8.52.6</b> The inscription on the statue of <prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn> at <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl> runs thus: <br>“The valor and glory of this man are famed throughout Greece, who worked <br>Many achievements by might and many by his counsels, <br><prn id='Q366117'>Philopoemen</prn>, the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadian</pl> spearman, whom great renown attended, <br>When he commanded the lances in war. <br>Witness are two trophies, won from the despots <br>Of <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>; the swelling flood of slavery he stayed. <br>Wherefore did <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl> set up [this statue]<br>the great-hearted son of <prn id='Q88466293'>Craugis</prn>, <br>Author of blameless freedom.” </p>
<p id='8.53.1'><b>8.53.1</b> Such is the inscription on the statue base. The images of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> <prn id='Q3848037'>Agyieus</prn> (lord of streets) the <pl id='Q645234'>Tegeans</pl> say they set up for the following reason. <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> and <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, they say, throughout every land visited with punishment all the men of that time who, when <prn id='Q103107'>Leto</prn> was with child and in the course of her wanderings, took no heed of her when she came to their land. </p>
<p id='8.53.2'><b>8.53.2</b> So when the divinities came to the land of <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl>, <prn id='Q3951778'>Scephrus</prn>, they say, the son of <prn id='Q3982573'>Tegeates</prn>, came to <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> and had a private conversation with him. And <prn id='Q3830028'>Leimon</prn>, who also was a son of <prn id='Q3982573'>Tegeates</prn>, suspecting that the conversation of <prn id='Q3951778'>Scephrus</prn> contained a charge against him, rushed on his brother and killed him. </p>
<p id='8.53.3'><b>8.53.3</b> Immediate punishment for the murder overtook <prn id='Q3830028'>Leimon</prn>, for he was shot by <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>. At the time <prn id='Q3982573'>Tegeates</prn> and <prn id='Q3854794'>Maera</prn> sacrificed to <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> and <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, but afterwards a severe famine fell on the land, and an oracle of <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> ordered a mourning for <prn id='Q3951778'>Scephrus</prn>. At the feast of the Lord of Streets rites are performed in honor of <prn id='Q3951778'>Scephrus</prn>, and in particular the priestess of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> pursues a man, pretending she is <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> herself pursuing <prn id='Q3830028'>Leimon</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.53.4'><b>8.53.4</b> It is also said that all the surviving sons of <prn id='Q3982573'>Tegeates</prn>, namely, <prn id='Q3676567'>Cydon</prn>, <prn id='Q106406443'>Archedius</prn> and <prn id='Q61863067'>Gortys</prn>, migrated of their own free will to <pl id='Q4752820'>Crete</pl>, and that after them were named the cities <pl id='Q1481525'>Cydonia</pl>, <pl id='Q1136193'>Gortyna</pl> and <pl id='Q65078139'>Catrea</pl>. The <pl id='Q4752820'>Cretans</pl> dissent from the account of the <pl id='Q645234'>Tegeans</pl>, saying that <prn id='Q3676567'>Cydon</prn> was a son of <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> and of <prn id='Q947753'>Acacallis</prn>, daughter of <prn id='Q23168'>Minos</prn>, that <prn id='Q754835'>Catreus</prn> was a son of <prn id='Q23168'>Minos</prn>, and <prn id='Q61863067'>Gortys</prn> a son of <prn id='Q193609'>Rhadamanthys</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.53.5'><b>8.53.5</b> As to <prn id='Q193609'>Rhadamanthys</prn> himself, <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> says, in the talk of <prn id='Q191481'>Proteus</prn> with <prn id='Q171839'>Menelaus</prn>, that <prn id='Q171839'>Menelaus</prn> would go to the <pl id='Q157128'>Elysian plain</pl>, but that <prn id='Q193609'>Rhadamanthys</prn> was already arrived there. <prn id='Q726952'>Cinaethon</prn> too in his poem represents <prn id='Q193609'>Rhadamanthys</prn> as the son of <prn id='Q44384'>Hephaestus</prn>, <prn id='Q44384'>Hephaestus</prn> as a son of <prn id='Q657174'>Talos</prn>, and <prn id='Q657174'>Talos</prn> as a son of <prn id='Q5184296'>Cres</prn>.

<p id='8.53.9'><b>8.53.9</b> The <pl id='Q645234'>Tegeans</pl> also have what they call a Common Hearth of the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl>. Here there is an image of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, and on his thigh is represented a wound received in the first fight with the sons of <prn id='Q342279'>Hippocoon</prn>. The lofty place, on which are most of the altars of the <pl id='Q645234'>Tegeans</pl>, is called the place of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> Clarius (Of Lots), and it is plain that the god got his surname from the lots cast for the sons of <prn id='Q606422'>Arcas</prn>. Here the <pl id='Q645234'>Tegeans</pl> celebrate a feast every year. </p>
<p id='8.53.10'><b>8.53.10</b> It is said that once at the time of the feast they were invaded by the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. As it was snowing, these were chilled, and thus distressed by their armour, but the <pl id='Q645234'>Tegeans</pl>, without their enemies knowing it, lighted a fire. So untroubled by the cold they donned, they say, their armour, went out against the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, and had the better of the engagement. I also saw in <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl>: — the house of <prn id='Q1536527'>Aleus</prn>, the tomb of <prn id='Q2993260'>Echemus</prn>, and the fight between <prn id='Q2993260'>Echemus</prn> and <prn id='Q847268'>Hyllus</prn> carved in relief upon a slab. </p>
<p id='8.53.11'><b>8.53.11</b> On the left of the road as you go from <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl> to <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconia</pl> there is an altar of <prn id='Q132582'>Pan</prn>, and likewise one of <pl id='Q111046342'>Lycaean</pl> <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>. The foundations, too, of sanctuaries are still there. These altars are two stades from the wall; and about seven stades farther on is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, surnamed <prn id='Q106516710'>Limnatis</prn>, with an image of ebony. The fashion of the workmanship is what the Greeks call <pl id='Q191082'>Aeginetan</pl>. Some ten stades farther on are the ruins of a <pl id='Q98147673'>temple</pl> of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> <prn id='Q107247372'>Cnaceatis</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.54.1'><b>8.54.1</b> The boundary between the territories of <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl> and <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl> is the river Alpheius. Its water begins in <pl id='Q60790436'>Phylace</pl>, and not far from its source there flows down into it another water from springs that are not large, but many in number, whence the place has received the name SymbolaYY (Meetings). </p>
<p id='8.54.2'><b>8.54.2</b> It is known that the Alpheius differs from other rivers in exhibiting this natural peculiarity; it often disappears beneath the earth to reappear again. So flowing on from <pl id='Q60790436'>Phylace</pl> and the place called SymbolaYY it sinks into the <pl id='Q645234'>Tegean</pl> plain; rising at <pl id='Q60791566'>Asea</pl>, and mingling its stream with the <pl id='Q119152'>Eurotas</pl>, it sinks again into the earth. </p>
<p id='8.54.3'><b>8.54.3</b> Coming up at the place called by the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> Pegae (Springs), and flowing past the land of <pl id='Q922329'>Pisa</pl> and past <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>, it falls into the sea above <pl id='Q56650616'>Cyllene</pl>, the port of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>. Not even the <pl id='Q13924'>Adriatic</pl> could check its flowing onwards, but passing through it, so large and stormy a sea, it shows in <pl id='Q1233234'>Ortygia</pl>, before <pl id='Q4420718'>Syracuse</pl>, that it is the <pl id='Q911084'>Alpheius</pl>, and unites its water with <pl id='Q3747483'>Arethusa</pl>. </p>
<p id='8.54.4'><b>8.54.4</b> The straight road from <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl> to <pl id='Q3036391'>Thyrea</pl> and to the villages its territory contains can show a notable sight in the tomb of <prn id='Q192407'>Orestes</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn>; from here, say the <pl id='Q645234'>Tegeans</pl>, a <pl id='Q5690'>Spartan</pl> stole his bones. In our time the grave is no longer within the gates. By the road flows also the river Garates. Crossing the Garates and advancing ten stades you come to a sanctuary of <prn id='Q132582'>Pan</prn>, by which is an oak, like the sanctuary sacred to <prn id='Q132582'>Pan</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.54.5'><b>8.54.5</b> The road from <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl> to <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> is very well suited for carriages, in fact a first-rate highway. On the road come first a temple and image of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>. Next, turning aside to the left for about a stade, you see a dilapidated sanctuary of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> surnamed <pl id='Q682558'>Pythian</pl> which is utterly in ruins. Along the straight road there are many oaks, and in the grove of oaks is a temple of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> called “in Corythenses.” Hard by is another sanctuary, that of Mystic <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>. </p>
<p id='8.54.6'><b>8.54.6</b> At this point begins Mount <pl id='Q833949'>Parthenius</pl>. On it is shown a sacred enclosure of <prn id='Q916442'>Telephus</prn>, where it is said that he was exposed when a child and was suckled by a deer. A little farther on is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q132582'>Pan</prn>, where <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> and <pl id='Q645234'>Tegeans</pl> agree that he appeared to <prn id='Q313728'>Philippides</prn> and conversed with him. </p>
<p id='8.54.7'><b>8.54.7</b> Mount <pl id='Q833949'>Parthenius</pl> rears also tortoises most suitable for the making of harps; but the men on the mountain are always afraid to capture them, and will not allow strangers to do so either, thinking them to be sacred to <prn id='Q132582'>Pan</prn>. Crossing the peak of the mountain you are within the cultivated area, and reach the boundary between <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl> and <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>; it is near <pl id='Q16575296'>Hysiae</pl> in <pl id='Q12649101'>Argolis</pl>. These are the divisions of the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl>, the cities in the divisions, and the most noteworthy things in each city. </p>
<p id='9.1.1'><b>9.1.1</b> BOOK 9 <br><pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl> borders on <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl> at several places, one of which is where <pl id='Q742538'>Plataea</pl> touches <pl id='Q1328318'>Eleutherae</pl>. The <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotians</pl> as a race got their name from <prn id='Q2715013'>Boeotus</prn>, who, legend says, was the son of <prn id='Q4205332'>Itonus</prn> and the nymph <prn id='Q12841832'>Melanippe</prn>, and <prn id='Q4205332'>Itonus</prn> was the son of <prn id='Q474854'>Amphictyon</prn>. The cities are called in some cases after men, but in most after women. The <pl id='Q742538'>Plataeans</pl> were originally, in my opinion, sprung from the soil; their name comes from <prn id='Q6078094'>Plataea</prn>, whom they consider to be a daughter of the river <prn id='Q622781'>Asopus</prn>. </p>
<p id='9.1.2'><b>9.1.2</b> It is clear that the <pl id='Q742538'>Plataeans</pl> too were of old ruled by kings; for everywhere in Greece in ancient times, kingship and not democracy was the established form of government. But the <pl id='Q742538'>Plataeans</pl> know of no king except <prn id='Q622781'>Asopus</prn> and <prn id='Q2974445'>Cithaeron</prn> before him, holding that the latter gave his name to the mountain, the former to the river. I think that <prn id='Q6078094'>Plataea</prn> also, after whom the city is named, was a daughter of King <prn id='Q622781'>Asopus</prn>, and not of the river. </p>
<p id='9.1.3'><b>9.1.3</b> Before the battle that the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> fought at <pl id='Q31900'>Marathon</pl>, the <pl id='Q742538'>Plataeans</pl> had no claim to renown. But they were present at the battle of <pl id='Q31900'>Marathon</pl>, and later, when <prn id='Q129165'>Xerxes</prn> came down to the sea, they bravely manned the fleet with the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, and defended themselves in their own country against the general of <prn id='Q129165'>Xerxes</prn>, <prn id='Q155063'>Mardonius</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q454695'>Gobryas</prn>. Twice it was their fate to be driven from their homes and to be taken back to <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl>. </p>
<p id='9.1.4'><b>9.1.4</b> For in the war between the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesians</pl> and <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> reduced <pl id='Q742538'>Plataea</pl> by siege, but it was restored during the peace made by the <pl id='Q5690'>Spartan</pl> <prn id='Q508188'>Antalcidas</prn> between the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl> and the Greeks, and the <pl id='Q742538'>Plataeans</pl> returned from <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>. But a second disaster was destined to befall them. There was no open war between <pl id='Q742538'>Plataea</pl> and <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>; in fact the <pl id='Q742538'>Plataeans</pl> declared that the peace with them still held, because when the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> seized the <pl id='Q1276854'>Cadmeia</pl> they had no part either in the plan or in the performance. </p>
<p id='9.1.5'><b>9.1.5</b> But the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> maintained that as the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> had themselves made the peace and then broken it, all alike, in their view, were freed from its terms. The <pl id='Q742538'>Plataeans</pl>, therefore, looked upon the attitude of the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> with suspicion, and maintained strict watch over their city. They did not go either daily to the fields at some distance from the city, but, knowing that the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> were wont to conduct their assemblies with every voter present, and at the same time to prolong their discussions, they waited for their assemblies to be called, and then, even those whose farms lay farthest away, looked after their lands at their leisure. </p>
<p id='9.1.6'><b>9.1.6</b> But NeoclesYY, who was at the time <prn id='Q1019919'>Boeotarch</prn> at <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>, not being unaware of the <pl id='Q742538'>Plataean</pl> trick, proclaimed that every <pl id='Q11225429'>Theban</pl> should attend the assembly armed, and at once proceeded to lead them, not by the direct way from <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> across the plain, but along the road to <pl id='Q17627339'>Hysiae</pl> in the direction of <pl id='Q1328318'>Eleutherae</pl> and <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl>, where not even a scout had been placed by the <pl id='Q742538'>Plataeans</pl>, being due to reach the walls about noon. </p>
<p id='9.1.7'><b>9.1.7</b> The <pl id='Q742538'>Plataeans</pl>, thinking that the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> were holding an assembly, were afield and cut off from their gates. With those caught within the city the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> came to terms, allowing them to depart before sundown, the men with one garment each, the women with two. What happened to the <pl id='Q742538'>Plataeans</pl> on this occasion was the reverse of what happened to them formerly when they were taken by the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> under <prn id='Q313731'>Archidamus</prn>. For the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> reduced them by preventing them from getting out of the city, building a double line of circumvallation; the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> on this occasion by preventing them from getting within their walls. </p>
<p id='9.1.8'><b>9.1.8</b> The second capture of <pl id='Q742538'>Plataea</pl> occurred two years before the battle of <pl id='Q2606004'>Leuctra</pl>, when <prn id='Q89088905'>Asteius</prn> was <prn id='Q636144'>Archon</prn> at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>. The <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> destroyed all the city except the sanctuaries, but the method of its capture saved the lives of all the <pl id='Q742538'>Plataeans</pl> alike, and on their expulsion they were again received by the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>. When <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn> after his victory at <pl id='Q13574678'>Chaeroneia</pl> introduced a garrison into <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>, one of the means he employed to bring the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> low was to restore the <pl id='Q742538'>Plataeans</pl> to their homes. </p>
<p id='9.2.1'><b>9.2.1</b> On Mount <pl id='Q1147780'>Cithaeron</pl>, within the territory of <pl id='Q742538'>Plataea</pl>, if you turn off to the right for a little way from the straight road, you reach the ruins of <pl id='Q17627339'>Hysiae</pl> and <pl id='Q56399414'>Erythrae</pl>. Once they were cities of <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl>, and even at the present day among the ruins of <pl id='Q17627339'>Hysiae</pl> are a half-finished temple of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> and a sacred well. According to the <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotian</pl> story oracles were obtained of old from the well by drinking of it. </p>
<p id='9.2.2'><b>9.2.2</b> Returning to the highway you again see on the right a tomb, said to be that of <prn id='Q155063'>Mardonius</prn>. It is agreed that the body of <prn id='Q155063'>Mardonius</prn> was not seen again after the battle, but there is not a similar agreement as to the person who gave it burial. It is admitted that ArtontesYY, son of <prn id='Q155063'>Mardonius</prn>, gave many gifts to DionysophYY the <pl id='Q47611'>Ephesian</pl>, but also that he gave them to others of the <pl id='Q620874'>Ionians</pl>, in recognition that they too had spent some pains on the burial of <prn id='Q155063'>Mardonius</prn>. </p>
<p id='9.2.3'><b>9.2.3</b> This road leads to <pl id='Q742538'>Plataea</pl> from <pl id='Q1328318'>Eleutherae</pl>. On the road from <pl id='Q42307600'>Megara</pl> there is a spring on the right, and a little farther on a rock. It is called the bed of <prn id='Q208531'>Actaeon</prn>, for it is said that he slept thereon when weary with hunting, and that into this spring he looked while <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> was bathing in it. <prn id='Q332797'>Stesichorus</prn> of <pl id='Q1111219'>Himera</pl> says that the goddess cast a deer-skin round <prn id='Q208531'>Actaeon</prn> to make sure that his <prn id='Q726'>hounds</prn> would kill him, so as to prevent his taking <prn id='Q776139'>Semele</prn> to wife. </p>
<p id='9.2.4'><b>9.2.4</b> My own view is that without divine interference the <prn id='Q726'>hounds</prn> of <prn id='Q208531'>Actaeon</prn> were smitten with madness, and so they were sure to tear to pieces without distinction everybody they chanced to meet. Whereabouts on <pl id='Q1147780'>Cithaeron</pl> the disaster befell <prn id='Q391091'>Pentheus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q1280725'>Echion</prn>, or where <prn id='Q130890'>Oedipus</prn> was exposed at birth, nobody knows with the assurance with which we know the <pl id='Q106485600'>Cleft Road</pl> to <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl>, where <prn id='Q130890'>Oedipus</prn> killed his father (Mount <pl id='Q1147780'>Cithaeron</pl> is sacred to <prn id='Q57523465'>Cithaeronian</prn> <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>), as I shall tell of at greater length when this place in my story has been reached. </p>
<p id='9.2.5'><b>9.2.5</b> Roughly at the entrance into <pl id='Q742538'>Plataea</pl> are the graves of those who fought against the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl>. Of the Greeks generally there is a common tomb, but the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> and <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> who fell have separate graves, on which are written elegiac verses by <prn id='Q273003'>Simonides</prn>. Not far from the common tomb of the Greeks is an altar of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q106542644'>Eleutherios</prn> (of freedom). This then is of bronze, but the altar and the statue he made of white marble. </p>
<p id='9.2.6'><b>9.2.6</b> Even at the present day they hold every four years games called <prn id='Q5829324'>Eleutheria</prn> (of freedom), in which great prizes are offered for running. The competitors run in armour before the altar. The <pl id='Q204636'>trophy</pl> which the Greeks set up for the battle at <pl id='Q204636'>Plataea</pl> stands about fifteen stades from the city. </p>
<p id='9.2.7'><b>9.2.7</b> Advancing in the city itself from the altar and the statue which have been made to <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q106542644'>Eleutherios</prn>, you come to a hero-shrine of <prn id='Q6078094'>Plataea</prn>. The legends about her, and my own conjectures, I have already stated. There is at <pl id='Q742538'>Plataea</pl> a temple of <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn>, worth seeing for its size and for the beauty of its statues. On entering you see <prn id='Q108419'>Rhea</prn> carrying to <prn id='Q44204'>Cronus</prn> the stone wrapped in swaddling clothes, as though it were the babe to which she had given birth. The <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> they call <prn id='Q106880607'>Teleia</prn> (full-grown); it is an upright statue of huge size. Both figures are of <pl id='Q1125206'>Pentelic</pl> marble, and the artist was <prn id='Q105290'>Praxiteles</prn>. Here too is another statue of <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn>; it is seated, and was made by <prn id='Q553631'>Callimachus</prn>. The goddess they call the Bride (nympheuomene) for the following reason. </p>
<p id='9.3.1'><b>9.3.1</b> <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn>, they say, was for some reason or other angry with <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, and had retreated to <pl id='Q173096'>Euboea</pl>. <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, failing to make her change her mind, visited <prn id='Q2974445'>Cithaeron</prn>, at that time despot in <pl id='Q742538'>Plataea</pl>, who surpassed all men for his cleverness. So he ordered <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> to make an image of wood, and to carry it, wrapped up, in a bullock wagon, and to say that he was celebrating his marriage with <prn id='Q6078094'>Plataea</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q622781'>Asopus</prn>. </p>
<p id='9.3.2'><b>9.3.2</b> So <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> followed the advice of <prn id='Q2974445'>Cithaeron</prn>. <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> heard the news at once, and at once appeared on the scene. But when she came near the wagon and tore away the dress from the image, she was pleased at the deceit, on finding it a wooden image and not a bride, and was reconciled to <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>. To commemorate this reconciliation they celebrate a festival called <prn id='Q5208152'>Daedala</prn>, because the men of old time gave the name of daedala to <prn id='Q693222'>xoana</prn>. My own view is that this name was given to <prn id='Q693222'>xoana</prn> before <prn id='Q134756'>Daedalus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q3562019'>Palamaon</prn>, was born at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, and that he did not receive this name at birth, but that it was a surname afterwards given him from the daedala. </p>
<p id='9.3.3'><b>9.3.3</b> So the <pl id='Q742538'>Plataeans</pl> hold the festival of the <prn id='Q5208152'>Daedala</prn> every six years, according to the local guide, but really at a shorter interval. I wanted very much to calculate exactly the interval between one Daedala and the next, but I was unable to do so. In this way they celebrate the feast. </p>
<p id='9.3.4'><b>9.3.4</b> Not far from <pl id='Q1044061'>Alalcomenae</pl> is a grove of oaks. Here the trunks of the oaks are the largest in <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl>. To this grove come the <pl id='Q742538'>Plataeans</pl>, and lay out portions of boiled flesh. They keep a strict watch on the <prn id='Q43365'>crows</prn> which flock to them, but they are not troubled at all about the other birds. They mark carefully the tree on which a <prn id='Q43365'>crow</prn> settles with the meat he has seized. They cut down the trunk of the tree on which the <prn id='Q43365'>crow</prn> has settled, and make of it the daedalum; for this is the name that they give to the wooden image also. </p>
<p id='9.3.5'><b>9.3.5</b> This feast the <pl id='Q742538'>Plataeans</pl> celebrate by themselves, calling it the Little Daedala, but the Great Daedala, which is shared with them by the <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotians</pl>, is a festival held at intervals of fifty-nine years, for that is the period during which, they say, the festival could not be held, as the <pl id='Q742538'>Plataeans</pl> were in exile. There are fourteen <prn id='Q693222'>xoana</prn> ready, having been provided each year at the Little Daedala. </p>
<p id='9.3.6'><b>9.3.6</b> Lots are cast for them by the <pl id='Q742538'>Plataeans</pl>, <pl id='Q593295'>Coronaeans</pl>, <pl id='Q1141295'>Thespians</pl>, <pl id='Q56259452'>Tanagraeans</pl>, <pl id='Q13574678'>Chaeroneans</pl>, <pl id='Q1855083'>Orchomenians</pl>, <pl id='Q11931280'>Lebadeans</pl>, and <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl>; for at the time when <prn id='Q207183'>Cassander</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q204760'>Antipater</prn>, rebuilt <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>, the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> wished to be reconciled with the <pl id='Q742538'>Plataeans</pl>, to share in the common assembly, and to send a sacrifice to the <prn id='Q5208152'>Daedala</prn>.

<p id='9.3.7'><b>9.3.7</b> Bringing the agalma to the <pl id='Q2737429'>Asopus</pl>, and setting it upon a wagon, they place a bridesmaid also on the wagon. They again cast lots for the position they are to hold in the procession. After this they drive the wagons from the river to the summit of <pl id='Q1147780'>Cithaeron</pl>. On the peak of the mountain an altar has been prepared, which they make after the following way. They fit together quadrangular pieces of wood, putting them together just as if they were making a stone building, and having raised it to a height they place brushwood upon the altar. </p>
<p id='9.3.8'><b>9.3.8</b> The cities with their magistrates sacrifice severally a <prn id='Q830'>cow</prn> to <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> and a <prn id='Q693690'>bull</prn> to <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, burning on the altar the victims, full of wine and incense, along with the daedala. Rich people, as individuals, sacrifice what they wish; but the less wealthy sacrifice the smaller <prn id='Q830'>cattle</prn>; all the victims alike are burned. The fire seizes the altar and the victims as well, and consumes them all together. I know of no blaze that is so high, or seen so far as this. </p>
<p id='9.3.9'><b>9.3.9</b> About fifteen stades below the peak, on which they make the altar, is a cave of the <prn id='Q106600805'>Cithaeronian nymphs</prn>. It is named Sphragidium, and the story is that of old the nymphs gave oracles in this place. </p>

The agalma is a gilded <prn id='Q693222'>xoanon</prn>, but the face, hands and feet are of <pl id='Q1125206'>Pentelic</pl> marble.

<p id='9.4.2'><b>9.4.2</b> In the temple are paintings: one of them, by <prn id='Q182855'>Polygnotus</prn>, represents <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn> after he has killed the wooers; the other, painted by <prn id='Q106600150'>Onasias</prn>, is the former expedition of the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>, under <prn id='Q223152'>Adrastus</prn>, against <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>.

<p id='9.4.3'><b>9.4.3</b> There is also at <pl id='Q742538'>Plataea</pl> a sanctuary of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>, surnamed <pl id='Q94299853'>Eleusinian</pl>, and a tomb of <prn id='Q2194100'>Leitus</prn>, who was the only one to return home of the chiefs who led <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotians</pl> to <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl>.

<p id='9.4.4'><b>9.4.4</b> On the road from <pl id='Q742538'>Plataea</pl> to <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> is the river <pl id='Q25019614'>Oeroe</pl>, said to have been a daughter of the <pl id='Q2737429'>Asopus</pl>. Before crossing the <pl id='Q2737429'>Asopus</pl>, if you turn aside to lower ground in a direction parallel to the river, after about forty stades you come to the ruins of <pl id='Q12884533'>Scolus</pl>. The temple of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> and <prn id='Q45967'>Kore</prn> among the ruins is not finished, and only half-finished are the images of the goddesses. Even today the <pl id='Q2737429'>Asopus</pl> is the boundary between <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> and <pl id='Q742538'>Plataea</pl>. </p>
<p id='9.5.1'><b>9.5.1</b> The first to occupy the land of <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> are said to have been the <prn id='Q1035082'>Ectenes</prn>, whose king was <prn id='Q1142802'>Ogygus</prn>, an aboriginal. From his name is derived <prn id='Q1232442'>Ogygian</prn>, which is an epithet of <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> used by most of the poets. The <prn id='Q1035082'>Ectenes</prn> perished, they say, by pestilence, and after them there settled in the land the <prn id='Q15618315'>Hyantes</prn> and the <prn id='Q106600636'>Aones</prn>, who I think were <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotian</pl> tribes and not foreigners. </p>
<p id='9.5.2'><b>9.5.2</b> When the <pl id='Q41642'>Phoenician</pl> army under <prn id='Q27613'>Cadmus</prn> invaded the land these tribes were defeated; the Hyantes fled from the land when night came, but the <prn id='Q106600636'>Aones</prn> begged for mercy, and were allowed by <prn id='Q27613'>Cadmus</prn> to remain and unite with the <pl id='Q41642'>Phoenicians</pl>. The <prn id='Q106600636'>Aones</prn> still lived in village communities, but <prn id='Q27613'>Cadmus</prn> built the city which even at the present day is called <pl id='Q1276854'>Cadmeia</pl>. Afterwards the city grew, and so the <pl id='Q1276854'>Cadmeia</pl> became the acropolis of the lower city of <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>. <prn id='Q27613'>Cadmus</prn> made a brilliant marriage, if, as the Greek legend says, he indeed took to wife a daughter of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> and <prn id='Q40901'>Ares</prn>. His daughters too have made him a name; <prn id='Q776139'>Semele</prn> was famed for having a child by <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, <prn id='Q223690'>Ino</prn> for being a divinity of the sea. </p>
<p id='9.5.3'><b>9.5.3</b> In the time of <prn id='Q27613'>Cadmus</prn>, the greatest power, next after his, was in the hands of the <prn id='Q598170'>Sparti</prn>, namely, <prn id='Q1088990'>Chthonius</prn>, <prn id='Q12767272'>Hyperenor</prn>, <prn id='Q3898964'>Pelorus</prn> and <prn id='Q4002579'>Udaeus</prn>; but it was <prn id='Q1280725'>Echion</prn> who, for his great valor, was preferred by <prn id='Q27613'>Cadmus</prn> to be his son-in-law. As I was unable to discover anything new about these men, I adopt the story that makes their name result from the way in which they came into being. When <prn id='Q27613'>Cadmus</prn> migrated to the <pl id='Q32047'>Illyrian</pl> tribe of the <pl id='Q1265876'>Encheleans</pl>, <prn id='Q1061554'>Polydorus</prn> his son got the kingdom. </p>
<p id='9.5.4'><b>9.5.4</b> Now <prn id='Q391091'>Pentheus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q1280725'>Echion</prn> was also powerful by reason of his noble birth and friendship with the king. Being a man of insolent character who had shown impiety to <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>, he was punished by the god. <prn id='Q1061554'>Polydorus</prn> had a son, <prn id='Q847005'>Labdacus</prn>. When <prn id='Q1061554'>Polydorus</prn> was about to die, <prn id='Q847005'>Labdacus</prn> was still a child, and so he was entrusted, along with the government, to the care of <prn id='Q741155'>Nycteus</prn>. </p>
<p id='9.5.5'><b>9.5.5</b> The sequel of this story, how <prn id='Q741155'>Nycteus</prn> died, and how the care of the boy with the sovereignty of <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> devolved on <prn id='Q1047047'>Lycus</prn>, the brother of <prn id='Q741155'>Nycteus</prn>, I have already set forth in my account of <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl>. When <prn id='Q847005'>Labdacus</prn> grew up, <prn id='Q1047047'>Lycus</prn> handed over to him the reins of government; but <prn id='Q847005'>Labdacus</prn> too died shortly afterwards, and <prn id='Q1047047'>Lycus</prn> again became guardian, this time to <prn id='Q463898'>Laius</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q847005'>Labdacus</prn>. </p>
<p id='9.5.6'><b>9.5.6</b> While <prn id='Q1047047'>Lycus</prn> was regent for the second time, <prn id='Q242835'>Amphion</prn> and <prn id='Q196865'>Zethus</prn> gathered a force and came back to <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>. <prn id='Q463898'>Laius</prn> was secretly removed by such as were anxious that the race of <prn id='Q27613'>Cadmus</prn> should not be forgotten by posterity, and <prn id='Q1047047'>Lycus</prn> was overcome in the fighting by the sons of <prn id='Q461439'>Antiope</prn>. When they succeeded to the throne they added the lower city to the <pl id='Q1276854'>Cadmeia</pl>, giving it, because of their kinship to <prn id='Q2416381'>Thebe</prn>, the name of <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>. </p>
<p id='9.5.7'><b>9.5.7</b> What I have said is confirmed by what <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> says in the <prn id='Q35160'>Odyssey</prn>: “Who first laid the foundation of seven-gated <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>, And built towers about it, for without towers they could not Dwell in wide-wayed <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>, in spite of their strength.” <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>, however, makes no mention in his poetry of <prn id='Q242835'>Amphion</prn>'s singing, and how he built the wall to the music of his harp. <prn id='Q242835'>Amphion</prn> won fame for his music, learning from the <pl id='Q620765'>Lydians</pl> themselves the <pl id='Q620765'>Lydian</pl> mode, because of his relationship to <prn id='Q182101'>Tantalus</prn>, and adding three strings to the four old ones. </p>
<p id='9.5.8'><b>9.5.8</b> The writer of the poem on <prn id='Q165170'>Europa</prn> says that <prn id='Q242835'>Amphion</prn> was the first harpist, and that <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> was his teacher. He also says that <prn id='Q242835'>Amphion</prn>'s songs drew even stones and beasts after him. <prn id='Q541746'>Myro</prn> of <pl id='Q23725'>Byzantium</pl>, a poetess who wrote epic and elegiac poetry, states that <prn id='Q242835'>Amphion</prn> was the first to set up an altar to <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn>, and for this reason was presented by him with a harp. It is also said that <prn id='Q242835'>Amphion</prn> is punished in <pl id='Q1521549'>Hades</pl> for being among those who made a mock of <prn id='Q103107'>Leto</prn> and her children. </p>
<p id='9.5.9'><b>9.5.9</b> The punishment of <prn id='Q242835'>Amphion</prn> is dealt with in the epic poem <prn id='Q6871244'>Minyad</prn>, which treats both of <prn id='Q242835'>Amphion</prn> and also of <prn id='Q853014'>Thamyris</prn> of <pl id='Q41741'>Thrace</pl>. The houses of both <prn id='Q242835'>Amphion</prn> and <prn id='Q196865'>Zethus</prn> were visited by bereavement; <prn id='Q242835'>Amphion</prn>'s was left desolate by plague, and the son of <prn id='Q196865'>Zethus</prn> was killed through some mistake or other of his mother. <prn id='Q196865'>Zethus</prn> himself died of a broken heart, and so <prn id='Q463898'>Laius</prn> was restored by the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> to the kingdom. </p>
<p id='9.5.10'><b>9.5.10</b> When <prn id='Q463898'>Laius</prn> was king and married to <prn id='Q131445'>Iocasta</prn>, an oracle came from <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> that, if <prn id='Q131445'>Iocasta</prn> bore a child, <prn id='Q463898'>Laius</prn> would meet his death at his son's hands. Whereupon <prn id='Q130890'>Oedipus</prn> was exposed, who was fated when he grew up to kill his father; he also married his mother. But I do not think that he had children by her; my witness is <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>, who says in the <prn id='Q35160'>Odyssey</prn>: </p>
<p id='9.5.11'><b>9.5.11</b> “And I saw the mother of <prn id='Q130890'>Oedipodes</prn>, fair <prn id='Q131445'>Epicaste</prn>, Who wrought a dreadful deed unwittingly, Marrying her son, who slew his father and Wedded her. But forthwith the gods made it known among men.” How could they “have made it known forthwith,” if <prn id='Q131445'>Epicaste</prn> had borne four children to <prn id='Q130890'>Oedipus</prn>? But the mother of these children was <prn id='Q1378458'>Euryganeia</prn>, daughter of Hyperphas. Among the proofs of this are the words of the author of the poem called the Oedipodia; and moreover, Onasias painted a picture at <pl id='Q742538'>Plataea</pl> of <prn id='Q1378458'>Euryganeia</prn> bowed with grief because of the fight between her children. </p>
<p id='9.5.12'><b>9.5.12</b> <prn id='Q334817'>Polyneices</prn> retired from <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> while <prn id='Q130890'>Oedipus</prn> was still alive and reigning, in fear lest the curses of the father should be brought to pass upon the sons. He went to <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> and married a daughter of <prn id='Q223152'>Adrastus</prn>, but returned to <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>, being fetched by <prn id='Q506550'>Eteocles</prn> after the death of <prn id='Q130890'>Oedipus</prn>. On his return he quarrelled with <prn id='Q506550'>Eteocles</prn>, and so went into exile a second time. He begged <prn id='Q223152'>Adrastus</prn> to give him a force to effect his return, but lost his army and fought a duel with <prn id='Q506550'>Eteocles</prn> as the result of a challenge. </p>
<p id='9.5.13'><b>9.5.13</b> Both fell in the duel, and the kingdom devolved on <prn id='Q765456'>Laodamas</prn>, son of <prn id='Q506550'>Eteocles</prn>; <prn id='Q732066'>Creon</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q1178176'>Menoeceus</prn>, was in power as regent and guardian of <prn id='Q765456'>Laodamas</prn>. When the latter had grown up and held the kingship, the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> led their army for the second time against <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>. The <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> encamped over against them at <pl id='Q11924352'>Glisas</pl>. When they joined in battle, <prn id='Q10966726'>Aegialeus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q223152'>Adrastus</prn>, was killed by <prn id='Q765456'>Laodamas</prn> but the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> were victorious in the fight, and <prn id='Q765456'>Laodamas</prn>, with any <pl id='Q11225429'>Theban</pl> willing to accompany him, withdrew when night came to <pl id='Q32047'>Illyria</pl>. </p>
<p id='9.5.14'><b>9.5.14</b> The <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> captured <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> and handed it over to <prn id='Q1289213'>Thersander</prn>, son of <prn id='Q334817'>Polyneices</prn>. When the expedition under <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn> against <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl> mistook its course and the reverse in <pl id='Q622319'>Mysia</pl> occurred, <prn id='Q1289213'>Thersander</prn> too met his death at the hands of <prn id='Q916442'>Telephus</prn>. He had shown himself the bravest Greek at the battle; his tomb, the stone in the open part of the agora, is in the city <pl id='Q779669'>Elaea</pl> on the way to the plain of the <pl id='Q1737602'>Caicus</pl>, and the natives say that they sacrifice to him as to a hero. </p>
<p id='9.5.15'><b>9.5.15</b> On the death of <prn id='Q1289213'>Thersander</prn>, when a second expedition was being mustered to fight <prn id='Q167646'>Alexander</prn> at <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl>, <prn id='Q254381'>Peneleos</prn> was chosen to command it, because <prn id='Q1788541'>Tisamenus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q1289213'>Thersander</prn>, was not yet old enough. When <prn id='Q254381'>Peneleos</prn> was killed by <prn id='Q120831'>Eurypylus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q916442'>Telephus</prn>, <prn id='Q1788541'>Tisamenus</prn> was chosen king, who was the son of <prn id='Q1289213'>Thersander</prn> and of <prn id='Q10265000'>Demonassa</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q330584'>Amphiaraus</prn>. The <prn id='Q180262'>Furies</prn> of <prn id='Q463898'>Laius</prn> and <prn id='Q130890'>Oedipus</prn> did not vent their wrath on <prn id='Q1788541'>Tisamenus</prn>, but they did on his son <prn id='Q784528'>Autesion</prn>, so that, at the bidding of the oracle, he migrated to the <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn>. </p>
<p id='9.5.16'><b>9.5.16</b> On the departure of <prn id='Q784528'>Autesion</prn>, <prn id='Q634361'>Damasichthon</prn> was chosen to be king, who was a son of <prn id='Q1419140'>Opheltes</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q254381'>Peneleos</prn>. This <prn id='Q634361'>Damasichthon</prn> had a son <prn id='Q1475386'>Ptolemy</prn>, who was the father of <prn id='Q2031409'>Xanthus</prn>. <prn id='Q2031409'>Xanthus</prn> fought a duel with <prn id='Q3564602'>Andropompus</prn>, who killed him by craft and not in fair fight. Hereafter the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> thought it better to entrust the government to several people, rather than to let everything depend on one man. </p>
<p id='9.6.1'><b>9.6.1</b> Of the successes and failures of the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> in battle I found the most famous to be the following. They were overcome in battle by the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, who had come to the aid of the <pl id='Q742538'>Plataeans</pl>, when a war had arisen about the boundaries of their territory. They met with a second disaster when arrayed against the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> at <pl id='Q742538'>Plataea</pl>, at the time when they are considered to have chosen the cause of King <prn id='Q129165'>Xerxes</prn> rather than that of Greece. </p>
<p id='9.6.2'><b>9.6.2</b> The <pl id='Q11225429'>Theban</pl> people are in no way responsible for this choice, as at that time an oligarchy was in power at <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> and not their ancestral form of government. In the same way, if it had been while <prn id='Q242172'>Peisistratus</prn> or his sons still held <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> under a despotism that the foreigner had invaded Greece, the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> too would certainly have been accused of favouring <pl id='Q3746183'>Persia</pl>. </p>
<p id='9.6.3'><b>9.6.3</b> Afterwards, however, the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> won a victory over the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> at <pl id='Q1184284'>Delium</pl> in the territory of <pl id='Q56259452'>Tanagra</pl>, where the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> general <prn id='Q1620003'>Hippocrates</prn>, son of <prn id='Q12762590'>Ariphron</prn>, perished with the greater part of the army. During the period that began with the departure of the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl> and ended with the war between <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> and the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl>, the relations between <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> and the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> were friendly. But when the war was fought out and the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> navy destroyed, after a brief interval <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> along with <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl> was involved in the war with <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl>. </p>
<p id='9.6.4'><b>9.6.4</b> Overcome in battle at <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl> and <pl id='Q593295'>Coroneia</pl>, they won on the other hand at <pl id='Q2606004'>Leuctra</pl> the most famous victory we know of gained by Greeks over Greeks. They put down the boards of ten, which the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> had set up in the cities, and drove out the <pl id='Q5690'>Spartan</pl> governors. Afterwards they also waged for ten years consecutively the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocian</pl> war, called by the Greeks the Sacred war. </p>
<p id='9.6.5'><b>9.6.5</b> I have already said in my history of <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl> that the defeat at <pl id='Q13574678'>Chaeroneia</pl> was a disaster for all the Greeks; but it was even more so for the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl>, as a garrison was brought into their city. When <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn> died, and the kingship of <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl> devolved on <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn>, the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> succeeded in destroying the garrison. But as soon as they had done so, heaven warned them of the destruction that was coming on them, and the signs that occurred in the sanctuary of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> Lawgiver were the opposite of those that occurred before the action at <pl id='Q2606004'>Leuctra</pl>. </p>
<p id='9.6.6'><b>9.6.6</b> For then <prn id='Q1357'>spiders</prn> spun a white web over the door of the sanctuary, but on the approach of <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn> with his <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> the web was black. It is also said that there was a shower of ashes at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> the year before the war waged against them by <prn id='Q483783'>Sulla</prn>, which brought on them such great sufferings. </p>
<p id='9.7.1'><b>9.7.1</b> On this occasion the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> were removed from their homes by <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn>, and straggled to <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>; afterwards they were restored by <prn id='Q207183'>Cassander</prn>, son of <prn id='Q204760'>Antipater</prn>. Heartiest in their support of the restoration of <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> were the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, and they were helped by <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> and the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> of <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl>. </p>
<p id='9.7.2'><b>9.7.2</b> My own view is that in building <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> <prn id='Q207183'>Cassander</prn> was mainly influenced by hatred of <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn>. He destroyed the whole house of <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn> to the bitter end. <prn id='Q223134'>Olympias</prn> he threw to the exasperated <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> to be stoned to death; and the sons of <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn>, <prn id='Q447770'>Heracles</prn> by <prn id='Q5429464'>Barsina</prn> and <prn id='Q207847'>Alexander</prn> by <prn id='Q190055'>Roxana</prn>, he killed by poison. But he himself was not to come to a good end. He was filled with dropsy, and from the dropsy came worms while he was yet alive. </p>
<p id='9.7.3'><b>9.7.3</b> <prn id='Q295530'>Philip</prn>, the eldest of his sons, shortly after coming to the throne was seized by a wasting disease which proved fatal. <prn id='Q8636269'>Antipater</prn>, the next son, murdered his mother <prn id='Q242293'>Thessalonice</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn>, son of <prn id='Q313907'>Amyntas</prn>, and of <prn id='Q453968'>Nicasipolis</prn>, charging her with being too fond of <prn id='Q347170'>Alexander</prn>, who was the youngest of <prn id='Q207183'>Cassander</prn>'s sons. Getting the support of <prn id='Q59734'>Demetrius</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q200401'>Antigonus</prn>, he deposed with his help and punished his brother <prn id='Q8636269'>Antipater</prn>. However, it appeared that in <prn id='Q59734'>Demetrius</prn> he found a murderer and not an ally. </p>
<p id='9.7.4'><b>9.7.4</b> So some god was to exact from <prn id='Q207183'>Cassander</prn> a just requital. In the time of <prn id='Q207183'>Cassander</prn> all the ancient circuit of the <pl id='Q11225429'>Theban</pl> walls was rebuilt, but fate after all willed that afterwards the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> were again to taste the cup of great misfortune. For when <prn id='Q185126'>Mithridates</prn> had begun the war with the Romans, he was joined by the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl>, for no other reason, in my opinion, except their friendship for the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> people. But when <prn id='Q483783'>Sulla</prn> invaded <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl>, terror seized the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl>; they at once changed sides, and sought the friendship of the Romans. </p>
<p id='9.7.5'><b>9.7.5</b> <prn id='Q483783'>Sulla</prn> nevertheless was angry with them, and among his plans to humble them was to cut away one half of their territory. His pretext was as follows. When he began the war against <prn id='Q185126'>Mithridates</prn>, he was short of funds. So he collected offerings from <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>, those at <pl id='Q7698713'>Epidaurus</pl>, and all those at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> that had been left by the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl>. </p>
<p id='9.7.6'><b>9.7.6</b> These he divided among his soldiery, and repaid the gods with half of the <pl id='Q11225429'>Theban</pl> territory. Although by favour of the Romans the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> afterwards recovered the land of which they had been deprived, yet from this point they sank into the greatest depths of weakness. The lower city of <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> is all deserted today, except the sanctuaries, and the people live on the acropolis, which they call <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> and not <pl id='Q1276854'>Cadmeia</pl>. </p>
<p id='9.8.1'><b>9.8.1</b> Across the <pl id='Q2737429'>Asopus</pl>, about ten stades distant from the city, are the ruins of <pl id='Q3400070'>Potniae</pl>, in which is a grove of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> and <prn id='Q45967'>Kore</prn>. The images at the river that flows past <pl id='Q3400070'>Potniae</pl>. . . they name the goddesses. At an appointed time they perform their accustomed ritual, one part of which is to let loose young pigs into what are called “the halls.” At the same time next year these pigs appear, they say, in <pl id='Q382317'>Dodona</pl>. This story others can believe if they wish. </p>
<p id='9.8.2'><b>9.8.2</b> Here there is also a temple of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> Aigobolos (Goat-shooter). For once, when they were sacrificing to the god, they grew so violent with wine that they actually killed the priest of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>. Immediately after the murder they were visited by a pestilence, and the <prn id='Q682558'>Delphic oracle</prn> said that to cure it they must sacrifice a boy in the bloom of youth. A few years afterwards, so they say, the god substituted a <prn id='Q2934'>goat</prn> as a victim in place of their boy. In <pl id='Q3400070'>Potniae</pl> is also shown a well. The mares of the country are said on drinking this water to become mad. </p>
<p id='9.8.3'><b>9.8.3</b> On the way from <pl id='Q3400070'>Potniae</pl> to <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> there is on the right of the road a small enclosure with pillars in it. Here they think the earth opened to receive <prn id='Q330584'>Amphiaraus</prn>, and they add further that neither do birds sit upon these pillars, nor will a beast, tame or wild, graze on the grass that grows here. </p>
<p id='9.8.4'><b>9.8.4</b> In the circuit of the ancient wall of <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> were gates seven in number, and these remain today. One <pl id='Q106526347'>gate</pl> got its name, I learned, from <prn id='Q1326394'>Electra</prn>, the sister of <prn id='Q27613'>Cadmus</prn>, and another, the <pl id='Q106526373'>Proetidian</pl>, from a native of <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>. He was <prn id='Q106601515'>Proetus</prn>, but I found it difficult to discover his date and lineage. The <pl id='Q106526386'>Neistan gate</pl>, they say, got its name for the following reason. The last of the harp's strings they call nete, and <prn id='Q242835'>Amphion</prn> invented it, they say, at this gate. I have also heard that the son of <prn id='Q196865'>Zethus</prn>, the brother of <prn id='Q242835'>Amphion</prn>, was named <prn id='Q2006592'>Neis</prn>, and that after him was this gate called. </p>
<p id='9.8.5'><b>9.8.5</b> The Crenaean gate and the HypsistanYY they so name for the following reason. . . and by the HypsistanYY is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> surnamed <prn id='Q15850651'>Hypsistus</prn> (Most High). Next after these gates is the one called <prn id='Q1232442'>Ogygian</prn>, and lastly the HomoloidYY gate. It appeared to me too that the name of the last was the most recent, and that of the <prn id='Q1232442'>Ogygian</prn> the most ancient. </p>
<p id='9.8.6'><b>9.8.6</b> The name HomoloidYY is derived, they say, from the following circumstance. When the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> were beaten in battle by the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> near <pl id='Q11924352'>Glisas</pl>, most of them withdrew along with <prn id='Q765456'>Laodamas</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q506550'>Eteocles</prn>. A portion of them shrank from the journey to <pl id='Q32047'>Illyria</pl>, and turning aside to <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessaly</pl> they seized <pl id='Q106557752'>Homole</pl>, the most fertile and best-watered of the <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessalian</pl> mountains. </p>
<p id='9.8.7'><b>9.8.7</b> When they were recalled to their homes by <prn id='Q1289213'>Thersander</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q334817'>Polyneices</prn>, they called the gate, through which they passed on their return, the HomoloidYY gate after <pl id='Q106557752'>Homole</pl>. The entry into <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> from <pl id='Q742538'>Plataea</pl> is by the <pl id='Q106526347'>Electran gate</pl>. At this, so they say, <prn id='Q833806'>Capaneus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q1269165'>Hipponous</prn>, was struck by lightning as he was making a more furious attack upon the fortifications. </p>
<p id='9.9.1'><b>9.9.1</b> This war between <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> and <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> was, in my opinion, the most memorable of all those waged by Greeks against Greeks in what is called the heroic age. In the case of the war between the <pl id='Q11918833'>Eleusinians</pl> and the rest of the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, and likewise in that between the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> and the <prn id='Q1065225'>Minyans</prn>, the attackers had but a short distance through which to pass to the fight, and one battle decided the war, immediately after which hostilities ceased and peace was made. </p>
<p id='9.9.2'><b>9.9.2</b> But the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl> army marched from mid- <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl> to mid- <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl>, while <prn id='Q223152'>Adrastus</prn> collected his allied forces out of <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl> and from the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl>, and likewise mercenaries came to the help of the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> from <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl>, and the <prn id='Q18629873'>Phlegyans</prn> from the <prn id='Q1065225'>Minyan</prn> country. When the battle took place at the <pl id='Q106526588'>Ismenian sanctuary</pl>, the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> were worsted in the encounter, and after the rout took refuge within their fortifications. </p>
<p id='9.9.3'><b>9.9.3</b> As the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesians</pl> did not know how to assail the walls, and attacked with greater spirit than knowledge, many of them were killed by missiles hurled from the walls by the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl>, who afterwards sallied forth and overcame the rest while they were in disorder, so that the whole army was destroyed with the exception of <prn id='Q223152'>Adrastus</prn>. But the action was attended by severe losses to the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl>, and from that time they term a <pl id='Q11225429'>Cadmean</pl> victory one that brings destruction to the victors. </p>
<p id='9.9.4'><b>9.9.4</b> A few years afterwards <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> was attacked by <prn id='Q1289213'>Thersander</prn> and those whom the Greeks call Epigoni (Born later). It is clear that they too were accompanied not only by the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>, <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> and <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl>, but also by allies from <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl> and <pl id='Q42307600'>Megara</pl> invited to help them. <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> too was defended by their neighbors, and a battle at <pl id='Q11924352'>Glisas</pl> was fiercely contested on both sides. </p>
<p id='9.9.5'><b>9.9.5</b> Some of the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> escaped with <prn id='Q765456'>Laodamas</prn> immediately after their defeat; those who remained behind were besieged and taken. About this war an epic poem also was written called the <pl id='Q768515'>Thebaid</pl>. This poem is mentioned by <prn id='Q334235'>Callinus</prn>, who says that the author was <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>, and many good authorities agree with his judgment. With the exception of the <prn id='Q8275'>Iliad</prn> and <prn id='Q35160'>Odyssey</prn> I rate the Thebais more highly than any other poem. So much for the war waged by the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> against the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> on account of the sons of <prn id='Q130890'>Oedipus</prn>. </p>
<p id='9.10.1'><b>9.10.1</b> Not far from the gate is a common tomb, where lie all those who met their death when fighting against <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn> and the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl>. Hard by they show a place where, it is said, <prn id='Q27613'>Cadmus</prn> (he may believe the story who likes) sowed the teeth of the dragon, which he slew at the fountain, from which teeth men came up out of the earth. </p>
<p id='9.10.2'><b>9.10.2</b> On the right of the gate is a hill sacred to <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>. Both the hill and the god are called <pl id='Q106526588'>Ismenian</pl>, as the river <pl id='Q2422308'>Ismenus</pl> flows by the place. First at the entrance are <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> and <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn>, stone figures and named Pronaia (Of the fore-temple). The <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> is said to have been made by <prn id='Q177302'>Pheidias</prn>, the <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> by <prn id='Q309579'>Scopas</prn>. The temple is built behind. The cult statue is in size equal to that at <pl id='Q671358'>Branchidae</pl>; and does not differ from it at all in shape. Whoever has seen one of these two images, and learnt who was the artist, does not need much skill to discern, when he looks at the other, that it is a work of <prn id='Q1723440'>Canachus</prn>. The only difference is that the image at <pl id='Q671358'>Branchidae</pl> is of bronze, while the <pl id='Q106526588'>Ismenian</pl> is of cedar-wood. </p>
<p id='9.10.3'><b>9.10.3</b> Here there is a stone, on which, they say, used to sit <prn id='Q1332949'>Manto</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q656881'>Teiresias</prn>. This stone lies before the entrance, and they still call it <prn id='Q1332949'>Manto</prn>'s chair. On the right of the temple are statues of women made of stone, said to be portraits of <prn id='Q11925399'>Henioche</prn> and <prn id='Q64073707'>Pyrrha</prn>, daughters of <prn id='Q732066'>Creon</prn>, who reigned as guardian of <prn id='Q765456'>Laodamas</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q506550'>Eteocles</prn>. </p>
<p id='9.10.4'><b>9.10.4</b> The following custom is, to my knowledge, still carried out in <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>. A boy of noble family, who is himself both handsome and strong, is chosen priest of <pl id='Q106526588'>Ismenian</pl> <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> for a year. He is called Laurel-bearer, for the boys wear wreaths of laurel leaves. I cannot say for certain whether all alike who have worn the laurel dedicate by custom a bronze tripod to the god; but I do not think that it is the rule for all, because I did not see many votive tripods there. But the wealthier of the boys do certainly dedicate them. Most remarkable both for its age and for the fame of him who dedicated it is a tripod dedicated by <prn id='Q206214'>Amphitryon</prn> for <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> after he had worn the laurel. </p>
<p id='9.10.5'><b>9.10.5</b> Higher up than the <pl id='Q106526588'>Ismenian</pl> sanctuary you may see the fountain which they say is sacred to <prn id='Q40901'>Ares</prn>, and they add that a dragon was posted by <prn id='Q40901'>Ares</prn> as a sentry over the spring. By this fountain is the grave of <prn id='Q2305446'>Caanthus</prn>. They say that he was brother to <prn id='Q785598'>Melia</prn> and son to <prn id='Q161419'>Ocean</prn>, and that he was commissioned by his father to seek his sister, who had been carried away. Finding that <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> had <prn id='Q785598'>Melia</prn>, and being unable to get her from him, he dared to set fire to the precinct of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> that is now called the <pl id='Q106526588'>Ismenian</pl> sanctuary. The god, according to the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl>, shot him. </p>
<p id='9.10.6'><b>9.10.6</b> Here then is the tomb of <prn id='Q2305446'>Caanthus</prn>. They say that <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> had sons by <prn id='Q785598'>Melia</prn>, to wit, <prn id='Q60791518'>Tenerus</prn> and <prn id='Q20100759'>Ismenus</prn>. To <prn id='Q60791518'>Tenerus</prn> <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> gave the art of divination, and from <prn id='Q20100759'>Ismenus</prn> the <pl id='Q2422308'>river</pl> got its name. Not that the river was nameless before, if indeed it was called Ladon before <prn id='Q20100759'>Ismenus</prn> was born to <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>. </p>
<p id='9.11.1'><b>9.11.1</b> On the left of the gate named <pl id='Q106526347'>Electran</pl> are the ruins of a house where they say <prn id='Q206214'>Amphitryon</prn> came to live when exiled from <pl id='Q217379'>Tiryns</pl> because of the death of <prn id='Q26296'>Electryon</prn>; and the chamber of <prn id='Q190543'>Alcmena</prn> is still plainly to be seen among the ruins. They say that it was built for <prn id='Q206214'>Amphitryon</prn> by <prn id='Q1166183'>Trophonius</prn> and <prn id='Q390363'>Agamedes</prn>, and that on it was written the following inscription: <br>“When <prn id='Q206214'>Amphitryon</prn> was about to bring hither his bride <br><prn id='Q190543'>Alcmena</prn>, he chose this as a chamber for himself. <br><pl id='Q106376210'>Anchasian</pl> <prn id='Q1166183'>Trophonius</prn> and <prn id='Q390363'>Agamedes</prn> made it.” </p>
<p id='9.11.2'><b>9.11.2</b> Such was the inscription that the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> say was written here. They show also the tomb of the children of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> by <prn id='Q929768'>Megara</prn>. Their account of the death of these is in no way different from that in the poems of <prn id='Q983680'>Panyassis</prn> and of <prn id='Q332797'>Stesichorus</prn> of <pl id='Q1111219'>Himera</pl>. But the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> add that <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> in his madness was about to kill <prn id='Q206214'>Amphitryon</prn> as well, but before he could do so he was rendered unconscious by the blow of the stone. <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, they say, threw at him this stone, which they name Chastiser (sophronister). </p>
<p id='9.11.3'><b>9.11.3</b> Here are portraits of women in relief, but the statues are by this time rather indistinct. The <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> call them <prn id='Q106618728'>Pharmakides</prn> (potioners), adding that they were sent by <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> to hinder the birth-pangs of <prn id='Q190543'>Alcmena</prn>. So these kept <prn id='Q190543'>Alcmena</prn> from bringing forth her child. But <prn id='Q12878236'>Historis</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q656881'>Teiresias</prn>, thought of a trick to deceive the Pharmakides, and she uttered a loud cry of joy in their hearing, that <prn id='Q190543'>Alcmena</prn> had been delivered. So the story goes that the Pharmakides were deceived and went away, and <prn id='Q190543'>Alcmena</prn> brought forth her child. </p>
<p id='9.11.4'><b>9.11.4</b> Here is a <pl id='Q106526554'>Herakleion</pl>. The agalma, of white marble, is called Promachos (champion), and the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> <prn id='Q20102258'>Xenocritus</prn> and <prn id='Q11921130'>Eubius</prn> were the artists. But the ancient <prn id='Q693222'>xoanon</prn> is thought by the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> to be by <prn id='Q134756'>Daedalus</prn>, and the same opinion occurred to me. It was dedicated, they say, by <prn id='Q134756'>Daedalus</prn> himself, as a thank-offering for a benefit. For when he was fleeing from <pl id='Q4752820'>Crete</pl> in small vessels which he had made for himself and his son <prn id='Q34041'>Icarus</prn>, he devised for the ships sails, an invention as yet unknown to the men of those times, so as to take advantage of a favorable wind and outsail the oared fleet of <prn id='Q23168'>Minos</prn>. <prn id='Q134756'>Daedalus</prn> himself was saved, </p>
<p id='9.11.5'><b>9.11.5</b> but the ship of <prn id='Q34041'>Icarus</prn> is said to have overturned, as he was a clumsy helmsman. The drowned man was carried ashore by the current to the island, then without a name, that lies beyond <pl id='Q13580795'>Samos</pl>. <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> came across the body and recognized it, giving it burial where even today a small mound still stands to <prn id='Q34041'>Icarus</prn> on a promontory jutting out into the <pl id='Q34575'>Aegean</pl>.

<p id='9.11.6'><b>9.11.6</b> The carvings on the gables at <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> are by <prn id='Q105290'>Praxiteles</prn>, and include most of what are called the twelve labours. The slaughter of the <prn id='Q236429'>Stymphalian birds</prn> and the cleansing of the land of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> by <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> are omitted; in their place is represented the wrestling with <prn id='Q272006'>Antaeus</prn>. <prn id='Q354403'>Thrasybulus</prn>, son of Lycus, and the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> who with him put down the tyranny of the <prn id='Q643488'>Thirty</prn>, set out from <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> when they returned to <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, and therefore they dedicated in the <pl id='Q106526554'>sanctuary</pl> of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> colossal figures of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> and <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, carved by <prn id='Q505640'>Alcamenes</prn> in relief out of <pl id='Q1125206'>Pentelic</pl> marble. </p>
<p id='9.11.7'><b>9.11.7</b> Adjoining the <pl id='Q106526554'>sanctuary</pl> of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> are a gymnasium and a race-course, both being named after the god. Beyond the Sophronister/Chastiser stone is an altar of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> surnamed <prn id='Q107349835'>Spodios</prn> (ashen); it is made out of the ashes of the victims. The customary mode of divination here is from chance utterances (kledon), which is used by the Smyrnaeans, to my knowledge, more than by any other Greeks. For the Smyrnaeans have a sanctuary of the utterances (kledonon) outside the wall and above the city. </p>
<p id='9.12.1'><b>9.12.1</b> The <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> in ancient days used to sacrifice <prn id='Q693690'>bulls</prn> to <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> Spodios. Once when the festival was being held, the hour of the sacrifice was near but those sent to fetch the <prn id='Q693690'>bull</prn> had not arrived. And so, as a wagon happened to be near by, they sacrificed to the god one of the <prn id='Q473194'>oxen</prn>, and ever since it has been the custom to sacrifice working <prn id='Q473194'>oxen</prn>. The following story also is current among the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl>. As <prn id='Q27613'>Cadmus</prn> was leaving <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> by the road to <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl>, a <prn id='Q830'>cow</prn>, it is said, guided him on his way. This <prn id='Q830'>cow</prn> was one bought from the herdsmen of <prn id='Q51583754'>Pelagon</prn>, and on each of her sides was a white mark like the orb of a full moon. </p>
<p id='9.12.2'><b>9.12.2</b> Now the oracle of the god had said that <prn id='Q27613'>Cadmus</prn> and the host with him were to make their dwelling where the <prn id='Q830'>cow</prn> was going to sink down in weariness. So this is one of the places that they point out. Here there is in the open an altar and a statue of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, said to have been dedicated by <prn id='Q27613'>Cadmus</prn>. Those who think that the <prn id='Q27613'>Cadmus</prn> who came to the <pl id='Q11225429'>Theban</pl> land was an <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptian</pl>, and not a <pl id='Q41642'>Phoenician</pl>, have their opinion contradicted by the name of this <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, because she is called by the <pl id='Q41642'>Phoenician</pl> name of <prn id='Q106618800'>Onga</prn>, and not by the <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptian</pl> name of Sais. </p>
<p id='9.12.3'><b>9.12.3</b> The <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> assert that on the part of their acropolis, where today stands their agora, was in ancient times the house of <prn id='Q27613'>Cadmus</prn>. They point out the ruins of the bridal-chamber of <prn id='Q978079'>Harmonia</prn>, and of one which they say was <prn id='Q776139'>Semele</prn>'s into the latter they allow no one to step even now. Those Greeks who allow that the <prn id='Q66016'>Muses</prn> sang at the wedding of <prn id='Q978079'>Harmonia</prn>, can point to the spot in the agora where it is said that the goddesses sang. </p>
<p id='9.12.4'><b>9.12.4</b> There is also a story that along with the thunderbolt hurled at the bridalchamber of <prn id='Q776139'>Semele</prn> there fell a log from heaven. They say that <prn id='Q1061554'>Polydorus</prn> adorned this log with bronze and called it <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> <prn id='Q27613'>Cadmus</prn>. Near is a statue of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>; <prn id='Q11939352'>Onasimedes</prn> made it of solid bronze. The altar was built by the sons of <prn id='Q105290'>Praxiteles</prn>. </p>
<p id='9.12.5'><b>9.12.5</b> There is a statue of <prn id='Q1240680'>Pronomus</prn>, a very great favorite with the people for his playing on the flute. For a time flute-players had three forms of the flute. On one they played <prn id='Q960729'>Dorian</prn> music; for <pl id='Q32579'>Phrygian</pl> melodies flutes of a different pattern were made; what is called the <pl id='Q620765'>Lydian</pl> mode was played on flutes of a third kind. It was <prn id='Q1240680'>Pronomus</prn> who first devised a flute equally suited for every kind of melody, and was the first to play on the same instrument music so vastly different in form. </p>
<p id='9.12.6'><b>9.12.6</b> It is also said that he gave his audience untold delight by the expression of his face and by the movement of his whole body. He also composed for the <pl id='Q21235810'>Chalcidians</pl> on the <pl id='Q1137741'>Euripus</pl> a processional tune for their use in <pl id='Q106802906'>Delos</pl>. So the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> set up here a statue of this man, and likewise one of <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn>, son of <prn id='Q3395640'>Polymnis</prn>. </p>
<p id='9.13.1'><b>9.13.1</b> <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn> had famous ancestors, but his father had less wealth than a <pl id='Q11225429'>Theban</pl> of ordinary means. He was most thoroughly taught all the subjects of the national education, and when a young man went to receive instruction from <prn id='Q720939'>Lysis</prn>, a <pl id='Q3981082'>Tarentine</pl> by descent, learned in the philosophy of <prn id='Q10261'>Pythagoras</prn> the <pl id='Q13580795'>Samian</pl>. When <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl> was at war with <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineia</pl>, <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn> is said to have been sent with certain others from <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> to help the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. In the battle <prn id='Q316059'>Pelopidas</prn> received wounds, but his life was saved by <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn> at the greatest risk to his own. </p>
<p id='9.13.2'><b>9.13.2</b> Later on, when <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn> had come to <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> as an envoy, what time the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> said they were concluding with the Greeks the peace called the Peace of <prn id='Q508188'>Antalcidas</prn>, <prn id='Q271850'>Agesilaus</prn> asked him whether they would allow each <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotian</pl> city to swear to the peace separately. He replied: “No, <pl id='Q5690'>Spartans</pl>, not before we see your perioikoi taking the oath city by city.” </p>
<p id='9.13.3'><b>9.13.3</b> When the war between <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl> and <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> had already broken out, and the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> were advancing to attack the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> with a force of their own men and of their allies, <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn> with a part of the army occupied to meet them a position above the <pl id='Q1235405'>Cephisian</pl> lake, under the impression that at this point the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesians</pl> would make their invasion. But <prn id='Q373660'>Cleombrotus</prn>, the king of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, turned towards <pl id='Q12872250'>Ambrossus</pl> in <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl>. He massacred a <pl id='Q11225429'>Theban</pl> force under ChaereasYY, who was under orders to guard the passes, crossed the high ground and reached <pl id='Q2606004'>Leuctra</pl> in <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl>. </p>
<p id='9.13.4'><b>9.13.4</b> Here heaven sent signs to the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> people and to <prn id='Q373660'>Cleombrotus</prn> personally. The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> kings were accompanied on their expeditions by <prn id='Q7368'>sheep</prn>, to serve as sacrifices to the gods and to give fair omens before battles. The flocks were led on the march by she-<prn id='Q2934'>goats</prn>, called katoiades by the herdsmen. On this occasion, then, the <prn id='Q18498'>wolves</prn> dashed on the flock, did no harm at all to the <prn id='Q7368'>sheep</prn>, but killed the <prn id='Q2934'>goats</prn> called katoiades. </p>
<p id='9.13.5'><b>9.13.5</b> It was also said that the wrath of the daughters of <prn id='Q106560475'>Scedasus</prn> fell upon the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>. <prn id='Q106560475'>Scedasus</prn>, who lived near <pl id='Q2606004'>Leuctra</pl>, had two daughters, <prn id='Q12881148'>Molpia</prn> and <prn id='Q106879762'>Hippo</prn>. These in the bloom of their youth were wickedly outraged by two <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, <prn id='Q106879620'>Phrurarchidas</prn> and <prn id='Q106879627'>Parthenius</prn>. The maidens, unable to bear the shame of their violation, immediately hanged themselves. <prn id='Q106560475'>Scedasus</prn> repaired to <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl>, but meeting with no justice returned to <pl id='Q2606004'>Leuctra</pl> and committed suicide. </p>
<p id='9.13.6'><b>9.13.6</b> Well, on this occasion <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn> sacrificed with prayers to <prn id='Q106560475'>Scedasus</prn> and his girls, implying that the battle would be to avenge them no less than to secure the salvation of <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>. The <prn id='Q1019919'>Boeotarchs</prn> were not agreed, but differed widely in their opinions. For <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn>, Malgis and <prn id='Q214121'>Xenocrates</prn> were minded to do battle with the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> at once, but Damocleidas, DamophiluYY and Simangelus were against joining in battle, and urged that they should put wives and children safely out of the way in <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl>, and prepare to undergo a siege themselves. </p>
<p id='9.13.7'><b>9.13.7</b> So divergent were the views of the six. The seventh <prn id='Q1019919'>Boeotarch</prn>, whose name was Brachyllides, was guarding the pass by <pl id='Q1147780'>Cithaeron</pl>, and on his return to the army added his vote to the side of <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn>, and then there was a unanimous decision to try the ordeal of battle. </p>
<p id='9.13.8'><b>9.13.8</b> But <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn> had his suspicions of some of the <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotians</pl> especially of the <pl id='Q1141295'>Thespians</pl>. Fearing, therefore, lest they should desert during the engagement, he permitted all who would to leave the camp and go home. The <pl id='Q1141295'>Thespians</pl> left with all their forces, as did any other <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotians</pl> who felt annoyed with the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl>. </p>
<p id='9.13.9'><b>9.13.9</b> When the battle joined, the allies of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, who had hitherto been not the best of friends, now showed most clearly their hostility, by their reluctance to stand their ground, and by giving way wherever the enemy attacked them. The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> themselves and the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> were not badly matched adversaries. The former had their previous experience, and their shame of lessening the reputation of <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>; the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> realized that what was at stake was their country, their wives and their children. </p>
<p id='9.13.10'><b>9.13.10</b> But when king <prn id='Q373660'>Cleombrotus</prn> with several <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> magistrates had fallen, the <pl id='Q5690'>Spartans</pl> were bound by necessity not to give way, in spite of their distress. For among the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> it was considered the greatest disgrace to allow the body of a king to come into the hands of enemies. </p>
<p id='9.13.11'><b>9.13.11</b> The victory of <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> was the most famous ever won by Greeks over Greeks. The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> on the following day were minded to bury their dead, and sent a herald to the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl>. But <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn>, knowing that the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> were always inclined to cover up their disasters, said that he permitted their allies first to take up their dead, and only when these had done so did he approve of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>' burying their own dead. </p>
<p id='9.13.12'><b>9.13.12</b> Some of the allies took up no dead at all, as not a man of them had fallen; others had but slight loss to report. So when the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> proceeded to bury their own, it was at once proved that the fallen were <pl id='Q5690'>Spartans</pl>. The loss of the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> and of such <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotians</pl> as remained loyal amounted to forty-seven, but of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> themselves there fell more than a thousand men. </p>
<p id='9.14.1'><b>9.14.1</b> After the battle <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn> for a while, having proclaimed that the other <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesians</pl> should depart home, kept the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> cooped up in <pl id='Q2606004'>Leuctra</pl>. But when reports came that the <pl id='Q5690'>Spartans</pl> in the city were marching to a man to the help of their countrymen at <pl id='Q2606004'>Leuctra</pl>, <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn> allowed his enemy to depart under a truce, saying that it would be better for the <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotians</pl> to shift the war from <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl> to <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl>. </p>
<p id='9.14.2'><b>9.14.2</b> The <pl id='Q1141295'>Thespians</pl>, apprehensive because of the ancient hostility of <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> and its present good fortune, resolved to abandon their city and to seek a refuge in <pl id='Q106298096'>Ceressus</pl>. It is a stronghold in the land of the <pl id='Q1141295'>Thespians</pl>, in which once in days of old they had established themselves to meet the invasion of the <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessalians</pl>. On that occasion the <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessalians</pl> tried to take <pl id='Q106298096'>Ceressus</pl>, but success seemed hopeless. So they consulted the god at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>, </p>
<p id='9.14.3'><b>9.14.3</b> and received the following response: “A care to me is shady <pl id='Q2606004'>Leuctra</pl>, and so is the Alesian soil; A care to me are the two sorrowful girls of <prn id='Q106560475'>Scedasus</prn>. There a tearful battle is nigh, and no one will foretell it, Until the <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn> have lost their glorious youth, When the day of fate has come. Then may <pl id='Q106298096'>Ceressus</pl> be captured, but at no other time.” </p>
<p id='9.14.4'><b>9.14.4</b> On the latter occasion <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn> captured the <pl id='Q1141295'>Thespians</pl> who had taken refuge in <pl id='Q106298096'>Ceressus</pl>, and immediately afterwards devoted his attention to the situation in the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl>, to which also the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> were eagerly inviting him. On his arrival he won the willing support of <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>, while he collected again into their ancient city the <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineans</pl>, who had been scattered into village communities by <prn id='Q357594'>Agesipolis</prn>. He persuaded the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> to destroy all their weak towns, and built them a home where they could live together, which even at the present day is called <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl> (Great City). </p>
<p id='9.14.5'><b>9.14.5</b> The period of his office as <prn id='Q1019919'>Boeotarch</prn> had now expired, and death was the penalty fixed if a man exceeded it. So <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn>, disregarding the law as out of date, remained in office, marched to <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> with his army, and when <prn id='Q271850'>Agesilaus</prn> did not come out to meet him, turned to the founding of <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl>. <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn>, was the founder of the modern <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl>, and the history of its foundation I have included in my account of the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> themselves. </p>
<p id='9.14.6'><b>9.14.6</b> Meanwhile the allies of <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> scattered and overran the <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconian</pl> territory, pillaging what it contained. This persuaded <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn> to lead the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> back to <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl>. In his advance with the army he came over against <pl id='Q1811299'>Lechaeum</pl>, and was about to cross the narrow and difficult parts of the road, when <prn id='Q354424'>Iphicrates</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q713679'>Timotheus</prn>, attacked the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> with a force of targeteers and other <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>. </p>
<p id='9.14.7'><b>9.14.7</b> <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn> put his assailants to flight and came right up to the very city of <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, but as <prn id='Q354424'>Iphicrates</prn> dissuaded the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> from coming out to fight, he proceeded to march back to <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>. <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn> stood his trial on a capital charge for holding the office of <prn id='Q1019919'>Boeotarch</prn> when his tenure had already expired. It is said that the jury appointed to try him did not even record their votes on the charge. </p>
<p id='9.15.1'><b>9.15.1</b> After these things when <prn id='Q465694'>Alexander</prn> [of Pherai] held sway in <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessaly</pl>, <prn id='Q316059'>Pelopidas</prn> came to him, under the impression that he was well-disposed to him personally as well as a friend to the <pl id='Q11225429'>Theban</pl> commonwealth, but on his arrival was treacherously and insolently thrown into prison and kept there by <prn id='Q465694'>Alexander</prn>. The <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> at once set out to attack <prn id='Q465694'>Alexander</prn>, and made leaders of the expedition CleomenesYY and HypatusYY, who were <prn id='Q1019919'>Boeotarchs</prn> at that time; <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn> was serving in the ranks. </p>
<p id='9.15.2'><b>9.15.2</b> When the force had reached the other side of <pl id='Q194450'>Thermopylae</pl>, <prn id='Q465694'>Alexander</prn> surprised and attacked it on difficult ground. As there appeared to be no means of safety, the rest of the army chose <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn> to be leader, and the <prn id='Q1019919'>Boeotarchs</prn> of their own accord resigned the command. <prn id='Q465694'>Alexander</prn> lost confidence in winning the war when he saw <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn> at the head of his opponents, and of his own accord set free <prn id='Q316059'>Pelopidas</prn>. </p>
<p id='9.15.3'><b>9.15.3</b> In the absence of <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn> the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> removed the <pl id='Q1855083'>Orchomenians</pl> from their land. <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn> regarded their removal as a disaster, and declared that had he been present never would the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> have been guilty of such an outrage. </p>
<p id='9.15.4'><b>9.15.4</b> Elected again to be <prn id='Q1019919'>Boeotarch</prn>, and again invading the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl> with an army of <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotians</pl>, he overcame the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> in a battle at <pl id='Q1811299'>Lechaeum</pl>, and with them <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> of <pl id='Q2068130'>Pellene</pl> and <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> led from <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> by <prn id='Q543525'>Chabrias</prn>. The <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> had a rule that they should set free for a ransom all their prisoners except such as were <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotian</pl> fugitives; these they punished with death. So when he captured the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonian</pl> town of PhoebiaYY, in which were gathered most of the <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotian</pl> fugitives, he assigned to each of those whom he captured in it a new homeland (patrida), any that occurred to him, and set them free. </p>
<p id='9.15.5'><b>9.15.5</b> On reaching <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineia</pl> with his army, he was killed in the hour of victory by an <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl>.

The elegiac verses are these: “By my counsels was <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> shorn of her glory, And holy <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl> received at last her children. By the arms of <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> was <pl id='Q36024972'>Megalopolis</pl> encircled with walls, And all Greece won independence and freedom.” </p>
<p id='9.16.1'><b>9.16.1</b> Such were the claims to fame of <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn>. Not far away is a temple of <prn id='Q3575327'>Ammon</prn>; the statue, a work of <prn id='Q918382'>Calamis</prn>, was dedicated by <prn id='Q134929'>Pindar</prn>, who also sent to the <pl id='Q958997'>Ammon</pl> of <pl id='Q2370577'>Libya</pl> a hymn to <prn id='Q3575327'>Ammon</prn>. This hymn I found still carved on a triangular slab by the side of the altar dedicated to <prn id='Q3575327'>Ammon</prn> by <prn id='Q168261'>Ptolemy</prn> the son of <prn id='Q718154'>Lagus</prn>. After the sanctuary of <prn id='Q3575327'>Ammon</prn> at <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> comes what is called the omen-observatory of <prn id='Q656881'>Teiresias</prn>, and near it is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q213440'>Fortune</prn>, who carries the child <prn id='Q205251'>Wealth</prn>. </p>
<p id='9.16.2'><b>9.16.2</b> According to the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl>, the hands and face of the image were made by <prn id='Q1465890'>Xenophon</prn> the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl>, the rest of it by <prn id='Q16183231'>Callistonicus</prn>, a native. It was a clever idea of these artists to place <prn id='Q205251'>Wealth</prn> in the arms of <prn id='Q213440'>Fortune</prn>, and so to suggest that she is his mother or nurse. Equally clever was the conception of <prn id='Q378772'>Cephisodotus</prn>, who made the image of <prn id='Q214987'>Peace</prn> for the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> with <prn id='Q205251'>Wealth</prn> in her arms. </p>
<p id='9.16.3'><b>9.16.3</b> At <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> are three xoana of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>, so very ancient that they are actually said to be votive offerings of <prn id='Q978079'>Harmonia</prn>, and the story is that they were made out of the wooden figure-heads on the ships of <prn id='Q27613'>Cadmus</prn>. They call the first Ourania (heavenly), the second Pandemos (common), and the third Apostrophia (Rejecter). <prn id='Q978079'>Harmonia</prn> gave to <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> the surname of Ourania </p>
<p id='9.16.4'><b>9.16.4</b> to signify a love pure and free from bodily lust; that of Pandemos, to denote sexual intercourse; the third, that of Rejecter, that mankind might reject unlawful passion and sinful acts. For <prn id='Q978079'>Harmonia</prn> knew of many crimes already perpetrated not only among foreigners but even by Greeks, similar to those attributed later by legend to the mother of <prn id='Q163920'>Adonis</prn>, to <prn id='Q212818'>Phaedra</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q23168'>Minos</prn>, and to the Thracian <prn id='Q1138506'>Tereus</prn>. </p>
<p id='9.16.5'><b>9.16.5</b> The sanctuary of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> <prn id='Q2401559'>Thesmophoros</prn> (lawgiver) is said to have been at one time the house of <prn id='Q27613'>Cadmus</prn> and his descendants. The statue of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> is visible down to the chest. Here have been dedicated bronze shields, said to be those of <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl> officers who fell at <pl id='Q2606004'>Leuctra</pl>. </p>
<p id='9.16.6'><b>9.16.6</b> Near the <pl id='Q106526373'>Proetidian gate</pl> is built a theater, and quite close to the theater is a temple of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> surnamed <prn id='Q107247818'>Lysios</prn> (Deliverer). For when some <pl id='Q11225429'>Theban</pl> prisoners in the hands of <pl id='Q41741'>Thracians</pl> had reached <pl id='Q359627'>Haliartia</pl> on their march, they were delivered by the god, who gave up the sleeping <pl id='Q41741'>Thracians</pl> to be put to death. One of the two images here the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> say is <prn id='Q776139'>Semele</prn>. Once in each year, they say, they open the sanctuary on stated days. </p>
<p id='9.16.7'><b>9.16.7</b> There are also ruins of the house of <prn id='Q1047047'>Lycus</prn>, and the tomb of <prn id='Q776139'>Semele</prn>, but <prn id='Q190543'>Alcmena</prn> has no tomb. It is said that on her death she was turned from human form to a stone, but the <pl id='Q11225429'>Theban</pl> account does not agree with the <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarian</pl>. The Greek legends generally have for the most part different versions. Here too at <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> are the tombs of the children of <prn id='Q242835'>Amphion</prn>. The boys lie apart; the girls are buried by themselves. </p>
<p id='9.17.1'><b>9.17.1</b> Near is the temple of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> <prn id='Q3314305'>Eukleia</prn>. The image was made by <prn id='Q309579'>Scopas</prn>. They say that within the sanctuary were buried Androcleia and Alcis, daughters of <prn id='Q106873511'>Antipoenus</prn>. For when <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> and the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> were about to engage in battle with the <pl id='Q1855083'>Orchomenians</pl>, an oracle was delivered to them that success in the war would be theirs if their citizen of the most noble descent would consent to die by his own hand. Now <prn id='Q106873511'>Antipoenus</prn>, who had the most famous ancestors, was loath to die for the people, but his daughters were quite ready to do so. So they took their own lives and are honored therefor. </p>
<p id='9.17.2'><b>9.17.2</b> Before the temple of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> <prn id='Q3314305'>Eukleia</prn> is a <prn id='Q140'>lion</prn> made of stone, said to have been dedicated by <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> after he had conquered in the battle the <pl id='Q1855083'>Orchomenians</pl> and their king, <prn id='Q1294873'>Erginus</prn> son of <prn id='Q2980443'>Clymenus</prn>. Near it is <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> surnamed <prn id='Q2923080'>Boedromios</prn> (Rescuer), and <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> <prn id='Q21548139'>Agoraios</prn> (of the Market-place), another of the votive offerings of <prn id='Q134929'>Pindar</prn>. The pyre of the children of <prn id='Q242835'>Amphion</prn> is about half a stade from the graves. The ashes from the pyre are still there. </p>
<p id='9.17.3'><b>9.17.3</b> Near this are two stone statues of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, surnamed <prn id='Q107248407'>Zosteria</prn> (girding), said to have been dedicated by <prn id='Q206214'>Amphitryon</prn>. For here, they say, he put on his armour when he was about to give battle to <prn id='Q2640841'>Chalcodon</prn> and the <pl id='Q173096'>Euboeans</pl>. It seems that the ancients used the verb “to gird oneself” in the sense of “to put on one's armour,” and so they say that when <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> compares <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn> to <prn id='Q40901'>Ares</prn> “in respect of his girdle,” he is really saying that they were alike in the fashion of their armour. </p>
<p id='9.17.4'><b>9.17.4</b> The <pl id='Q106526021'>tomb</pl> shared by <prn id='Q196865'>Zethus</prn> and <prn id='Q242835'>Amphion</prn> is a small mound of earth. The inhabitants of <pl id='Q56697763'>Tithorea</pl> in <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl> like to steal earth from it when the sun is passing through the constellation <prn id='Q10570'>Taurus</prn>. For if at that time they take earth from the mound and set it on <prn id='Q461439'>Antiope</prn>'s tomb, the land of <pl id='Q56697763'>Tithorea</pl> will yield a harvest, but that of <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> be less fertile. For this reason the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> at that time keep watch over the tomb. </p>
<p id='9.17.5'><b>9.17.5</b> Both these cities hold this belief, and they do so because of the oracles of <prn id='Q708459'>Bacis</prn>, in which are the lines: <br>“But when a man of <pl id='Q56697763'>Tithorea</pl> to <prn id='Q242835'>Amphion</prn> and to <prn id='Q196865'>Zethus</prn> <br>Pours on the earth peace-offerings of libation and prayer, <br>When <prn id='Q10570'>Taurus</prn> is warmed by the might of the glorious sun, <br>Beware then of no slight disaster threatening the city; <br>For the harvest wastes away in it, <br>When they take of the earth, and bring it to the tomb of <prn id='Q3381352'>Phocus</prn>.” </p>
<p id='9.17.6'><b>9.17.6</b> <prn id='Q708459'>Bacis</prn> calls it the tomb of <prn id='Q3381352'>Phocus</prn> for the following reason. The wife of <prn id='Q1047047'>Lycus</prn> worshipped <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> more than any other deity. When she had suffered what the story says she suffered, <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> was angry with <prn id='Q461439'>Antiope</prn>. For some reason extravagant punishments always arouse the resentment of the gods. They say that <prn id='Q461439'>Antiope</prn> went mad, and when out of her wits roamed all over Greece; but <prn id='Q3381352'>Phocus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q2031315'>Ornytion</prn>, son of <prn id='Q102561'>Sisyphus</prn>, chanced to meet her, cured her madness, and then married her. </p>
<p id='9.17.7'><b>9.17.7</b> So <prn id='Q461439'>Antiope</prn> and <prn id='Q3381352'>Phocus</prn> share the same grave. The roughly quarried stones, laid along the <pl id='Q106526021'>tomb</pl> of <prn id='Q242835'>Amphion</prn> at its base, are said to be the very rocks that followed the singing of <prn id='Q242835'>Amphion</prn>. A similar story is told of <prn id='Q174353'>Orpheus</prn>, how wild creatures followed him as he played the harp. </p>
<p id='9.18.1'><b>9.18.1</b> The road from <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> to <pl id='Q21235810'>Chalcis</pl> is by this <pl id='Q106526373'>Proetidian gate</pl>. On the highway is pointed out the grave of <prn id='Q3332905'>Melanippus</prn>, one of the very best of the soldiers of <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>. When the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl> invasion occurred this <prn id='Q3332905'>Melanippus</prn> killed <prn id='Q250506'>Tydeus</prn>, as well as <prn id='Q1968413'>Mecisteus</prn>, one of the brothers of <prn id='Q223152'>Adrastus</prn>, while he himself, they say, met his death at the hands of <prn id='Q330584'>Amphiaraus</prn>. </p>
<p id='9.18.2'><b>9.18.2</b> Quite close to it are three unwrought stones. The <pl id='Q11225429'>Theban</pl> antiquaries assert that the man lying here is <prn id='Q250506'>Tydeus</prn>, and that his burial was carried out by <prn id='Q28708764'>Maeon</prn>. As proof of their assertion they quoted a line of the <prn id='Q8275'>Iliad</prn>: “Of <prn id='Q250506'>Tydeus</prn>, who at <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> is covered by a heap of earth.” [14.114] </p>
<p id='9.18.3'><b>9.18.3</b> Adjoining are the <pl id='Q38281808'>tombs</pl> of the children of <prn id='Q130890'>Oedipus</prn>. The ritual observed at them I have never seen, but I regard it as credible. For the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> say that among those called heroes to whom they offer sacrifice are the children of <prn id='Q130890'>Oedipus</prn>. As the sacrifice is being offered, the flame, so they say, and the smoke from it divide themselves into two. I was led to believe their story by the fact that I have seen a similar wonder. It was this. </p>
<p id='9.18.4'><b>9.18.4</b> In <pl id='Q622319'>Mysia</pl> beyond the <pl id='Q1737602'>Caicus</pl> is a town called <pl id='Q16737855'>Pioniae</pl>, the founder of which according to the inhabitants was Pionis, one of the descendants of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>. When they are going to sacrifice to him as to a hero, smoke of itself rises up out of the grave. This occurrence, then, I have seen happening. The <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> show also the tomb of <prn id='Q656881'>Teiresias</prn>, about fifteen stades from the grave of the children of <prn id='Q130890'>Oedipus</prn>. The <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> themselves agree that <prn id='Q656881'>Teiresias</prn> met his end in <pl id='Q359627'>Haliartia</pl>, and admit that the monument at <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> is a cenotaph. </p>
<p id='9.18.5'><b>9.18.5</b> There is also at <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> the grave of <prn id='Q159666'>Hector</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q170473'>Priam</prn>. It is near the spring called the Fountain of <prn id='Q130890'>Oedipus</prn>, and the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> say that they brought <prn id='Q159666'>Hector</prn>'s bones from <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl> because of the following oracle: “Ye <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> who dwell in the city of <prn id='Q27613'>Cadmus</prn>, If you wish blameless wealth for the country in which you live, Bring to your homes the bones of <prn id='Q159666'>Hector</prn>, <prn id='Q170473'>Priam</prn>'s son, From <prn id='Q48'>Asia</prn>, and reverence him as a hero, according to the bidding of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>.” </p>
<p id='9.18.6'><b>9.18.6</b> The Fountain of <prn id='Q130890'>Oedipus</prn> was so named because <prn id='Q130890'>Oedipus</prn> washed off into it the blood of his murdered father. Hard by the spring is the grave of <prn id='Q11905319'>Asphodicus</prn>. He it was who in the fighting with the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> killed <prn id='Q1128942'>Parthenopaeus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q668054'>Talaus</prn>. This is the <pl id='Q11225429'>Theban</pl> account, but according to the passage in the <prn id='Q478880'>Thebaid</prn> which tells of the death of <prn id='Q1128942'>Parthenopaeus</prn> it was <prn id='Q3899862'>Periclymenus</prn> who killed him. </p>
<p id='9.19.1'><b>9.19.1</b> On this highway is a place called <pl id='Q15627845'>Teumessus</pl>, where it is said that <prn id='Q165170'>Europa</prn> was hidden by <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>. There is also another legend, which tells of a <prn id='Q8331'>fox</prn> called the Teumessian <prn id='Q8331'>fox</prn>, how owing to the wrath of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> the beast was reared to destroy the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl>, and how, when about to be caught by the hound given by <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> to <prn id='Q1139470'>Procris</prn> the daughter of <prn id='Q301219'>Erechtheus</prn>, the <prn id='Q8331'>fox</prn> was turned into a stone, as was likewise this hound. In <pl id='Q15627845'>Teumessus</pl> there is also a sanctuary of <prn id='Q1134605'>Telchinian</prn> <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, which contains no statue. As to her surname, we may hazard the conjecture that a division of the <prn id='Q1134605'>Telchinians</prn> who once dwelt in <pl id='Q644636'>Cyprus</pl> came to <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl> and established a sanctuary of <prn id='Q1134605'>Telchinian</prn> <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>. </p>
<p id='9.19.2'><b>9.19.2</b> Seven stades from <pl id='Q15627845'>Teumessus</pl> on the left are the ruins of <pl id='Q11924352'>Glisas</pl>, and before them on the right of the way a small mound shaded by cultivated trees and a wood of wild ones. Here were buried <prn id='Q519168'>Promachus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q1128942'>Parthenopaeus</prn>, and other <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl> officers, who joined with <prn id='Q10966726'>Aegialeus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q223152'>Adrastus</prn>, in the expedition against <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>. That the tomb of <prn id='Q10966726'>Aegialeus</prn> is at <pl id='Q935675'>Pegae</pl> I have already stated in an earlier part of my history that deals with <pl id='Q42307600'>Megara</pl>. </p>
<p id='9.19.3'><b>9.19.3</b> On the straight road from <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> to <pl id='Q11924352'>Glisas</pl> is a place surrounded by unhewn stones, called by the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> the <prn id='Q2102'>Snake</prn>'s Head. This <prn id='Q2102'>snake</prn>, whatever it was, popped its head, they say, out of its hole here, and <prn id='Q656881'>Teiresias</prn>, chancing to meet it, cut off the head with his sword. This then is how the place got its name. Above <pl id='Q11924352'>Glisas</pl> is a mountain called Hypatos (Supreme), and on it a <pl id='Q106355998'>temple</pl> and image of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q107243158'>Hypatos</prn>.

Returning to <pl id='Q15627845'>Teumessus</pl> and the road to <pl id='Q21235810'>Chalcis</pl>, you come to the tomb of <prn id='Q2640841'>Chalcodon</prn>, who was killed by <prn id='Q206214'>Amphitryon</prn> in a fight between the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> and the <pl id='Q173096'>Euboeans</pl>. </p>
<p id='9.19.4'><b>9.19.4</b> Adjoining are the ruins of the cities <pl id='Q57401086'>Harma</pl> (Chariot) and <pl id='Q1529070'>Mycalessus</pl>. The former got its name, according to the people of <pl id='Q56259452'>Tanagra</pl>, because the chariot of <prn id='Q330584'>Amphiaraus</prn> disappeared here, and not where the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> say it did. Both peoples agree that <pl id='Q1529070'>Mycalessus</pl> was so named because the <prn id='Q830'>cow</prn> lowed (emykesato) here that was guiding <prn id='Q27613'>Cadmus</prn> and his host to <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>.

<p id='9.19.5'><b>9.19.5</b> On the way to the coast of <pl id='Q1529070'>Mycalessus</pl> is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q107251001'>Mycalessian</prn> <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>.

<p id='9.19.6'><b>9.19.6</b> At this place the <pl id='Q1137741'>Euripus</pl> separates <pl id='Q173096'>Euboea</pl> from <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl>.

Here there is a temple of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> with two images of white marble; one carries torches, and the other is like to one shooting an arrow. The story is that when, in obedience to the soothsaying of <prn id='Q725527'>Calchas</prn>, the Greeks were about to sacrifice <prn id='Q192673'>Iphigeneia</prn> on the altar, the goddess substituted a deer to be the victim instead of her.

<p id='9.19.7'><b>9.19.7</b> plane-tree mentioned by <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> in the <prn id='Q8275'>Iliad</prn>. The story is that the Greeks were kept at <pl id='Q2612265'>Aulis</pl> by contrary winds, and when suddenly a favouring breeze sprang up, each sacrificed to <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> the victim he had to hand, female and male alike. From that time the rule has held good at <pl id='Q2612265'>Aulis</pl> that all victims are permissible.

<p id='9.19.8'><b>9.19.8</b> In front of the sanctuary grow palm-trees, the fruit of which, though not wholly edible like the dates of <pl id='Q23792'>Palestine</pl>, yet are riper than those of <pl id='Q620874'>Ionia</pl>.

In it are images of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> and <prn id='Q103107'>Leto</prn>. The people of <pl id='Q56259452'>Tanagra</pl> say that their founder was <prn id='Q4348382'>Poemander</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q5066581'>Chaeresilaus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q106405710'>Iasius</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q1328289'>Eleuther</prn>, who, they say, was the son of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> by <prn id='Q15709147'>Aethusa</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>. It is said that <prn id='Q4348382'>Poemander</prn> married <prn id='Q3514925'>Tanagra</prn>, a daughter of <prn id='Q406388'>Aeolus</prn>. But in a poem of <prn id='Q241132'>Corinna</prn> she is said to be a daughter of <prn id='Q622781'>Asopus</prn>. </p>
<p id='9.20.2'><b>9.20.2</b> There is a story that, as she reached extreme old age, her neighbors ceased to call her by this name, and gave the name of <pl id='Q15616542'>Graea</pl> (old woman), first to the woman herself, and in course of time to the city. The name, they say, persisted so long that even <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> says in the <prn id='Q1233048'>Catalogue</prn>: “<pl id='Q1141295'>Thespeia</pl>, <pl id='Q15616542'>Graea</pl>, and wide <pl id='Q1529070'>Mycalessus</pl>.” Later, however, it recovered its old name. </p>
<p id='9.20.3'><b>9.20.3</b> There is in <pl id='Q56259452'>Tanagra</pl> the tomb of <prn id='Q201261'>Orion</prn>, and Mount Cerycius, the reputed birthplace of <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn>, and also a place called Polus1. Here they say that <prn id='Q130818'>Atlas</prn> sat and meditated deeply upon hell and heaven, as <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> says of him: <br>“Daughter of baneful <prn id='Q130818'>Atlas</prn>, who knows the depths <br>Of every sea, while he himself holds up the tall pillars, <br>Which keep apart earth and heaven.” </p>
<p id='9.20.4'><b>9.20.4</b> In the temple of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> the image too is worth seeing, being of <pl id='Q65040323'>Parian</pl> marble and a work of <prn id='Q918382'>Calamis</prn>. But a greater marvel still is the <prn id='Q1860727'>Triton</prn>. The grander of the two versions of the <prn id='Q1860727'>Triton</prn> legend relates that the women of <pl id='Q56259452'>Tanagra</pl> before the orgies of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> went down to the sea to be purified, were attacked by the <prn id='Q1860727'>Triton</prn> as they were swimming, and prayed that <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> would come to their aid. The god, it is said, heard their cry and overcame the <prn id='Q1860727'>Triton</prn> in the fight. </p>
<p id='9.20.5'><b>9.20.5</b> The other version is less grand but more credible. It says that the <prn id='Q1860727'>Triton</prn> would waylay and lift all the <prn id='Q830'>cattle</prn> that were driven to the sea. He used even to attack small vessels, until the people of <pl id='Q56259452'>Tanagra</pl> set out for him a bowl of wine. They say that, attracted by the smell, he came at once, drank the wine, flung himself on the shore and slept, and that a man of <pl id='Q56259452'>Tanagra</pl> struck him on the neck with an axe and chopped off his head. For this reason the image has no head. And because they caught him drunk, it is supposed that it was <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> who killed him. </p>
<p id='9.21.1'><b>9.21.1</b> I saw another <prn id='Q1860727'>Triton</prn> among the curiosities at <pl id='Q18287233'>Rome</pl>, less in size than the one at <pl id='Q56259452'>Tanagra</pl>. The <prn id='Q1860727'>Tritons</prn> have the following appearance. On their heads they grow hair like that of marsh Frog1 not only in color, but also in the impossibility of separating one hair from another. The rest of their body is rough with fine scales just as is the shark. Under their ears they have gills and a man's nose; but the mouth is broader and the teeth are those of a beast. Their eyes seem to me blue, and they have hands, fingers, and nails like the shells of the murex. Under the breast and belly is a tail like a <prn id='Q7369'>dolphin</prn>'s instead of feet. </p>
<p id='9.21.2'><b>9.21.2</b> I saw also the Ethiopian <prn id='Q693690'>bulls</prn>, called rhinoceroses owing to the fact that each has one horn (ceras) at the end of the nose (rhis), over which is another but smaller one, but there is no trace of horns on their heads. I saw too the <pl id='Q249561'>Paeonian</pl> <prn id='Q693690'>bulls</prn>, which are shaggy all over, but especially about the chest and lower jaw. I saw also <pl id='Q17055962'>Indian</pl> <prn id='Q7375'>camels</prn> with the color of leopards. </p>
<p id='9.21.3'><b>9.21.3</b> There is also a beast called the elk, in form between a deer and a <prn id='Q7375'>camel</prn>, which breeds in the land of the <pl id='Q35966'>Celts</pl>. Of all the beasts we know it alone cannot be tracked or seen at a distance by man; sometimes, however, when men are out hunting other game they fall in with an elk by luck. Now they say that it smells man even at a great distance, and dashes down into ravines or the deepest caverns. So the hunters surround the plain or mountain in a circuit of at least a thousand stades, and, taking care not to break the circle, they keep on narrowing the area enclosed, and so catch all the beasts inside, the elks included. But if there chance to be no lair within, there is no other way of catching the elk. </p>
<p id='9.21.4'><b>9.21.4</b> The beast described by <prn id='Q296325'>Ctesias</prn> in his <pl id='Q17055962'>Indian</pl> history, which he says is called martichoras by the <pl id='Q17055962'>Indians</pl> and man-eater by the Greeks, I am inclined to think is the tiger. But that it has three rows of teeth along each jaw and spikes at the tip of its tail with which it defends itself at close quarters, while it hurls them like an archer's arrows at more distant enemies; all this is, I think, a false story that the <pl id='Q17055962'>Indians</pl> pass on from one to another owing to their excessive dread of the beast. </p>
<p id='9.21.5'><b>9.21.5</b> They were also deceived about its color, and whenever the tiger showed itself in the light of the sun it appeared to be a homogeneous red, either because of its speed, or, if it were not running, because of its continual twists and turns, especially when it was not seen at close quarters. And I think that if one were to traverse the most remote parts of <pl id='Q2370577'>Libya</pl>, <pl id='Q17055962'>India</pl> or <pl id='Q57751375'>Arabia</pl>, in search of such beasts as are found in Greece, some he would not discover at all, and others would have a different appearance. </p>
<p id='9.21.6'><b>9.21.6</b> For man is not the only creature that has a different appearance in different climates and in different countries; the others too obey the same rule. For instance, the Libyan asps have a different colors compared with the <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptian</pl>, while in <pl id='Q410453'>Ethiopia</pl> are bred asps quite as black as the men. So everyone should be neither over-hasty in one's judgments, nor incredulous when considering rarities. For instance, though I have never seen winged <prn id='Q2102'>snakes</prn> I believe that they exist, as I believe that a <pl id='Q32579'>Phrygian</pl> brought to <pl id='Q620874'>Ionia</pl> a scorpion with wings exactly like those of locusts. </p>
<p id='9.22.1'><b>9.22.1</b> Beside the sanctuary of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> at <pl id='Q56259452'>Tanagra</pl> are three temples, one of <prn id='Q159168'>Themis</prn>, another of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>, and the third of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>; with <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> are joined <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> and <prn id='Q103107'>Leto</prn>. There are sanctuaries of <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> <prn id='Q26047305'>Kriophoros</prn> (Ram-bearer) and of <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> called <prn id='Q107244115'>Promachus</prn> (Champion). They account for the former surname by a story that <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> averted a pestilence from the city by carrying a ram round the walls; to commemorate this <prn id='Q918382'>Calamis</prn> made an image of <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> carrying a ram upon his shoulders. Whichever of the youths is judged to be the most handsome goes round the walls at the feast of <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn>, carrying a lamb on his shoulders. </p>
<p id='9.22.2'><b>9.22.2</b> <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> <prn id='Q107244115'>Promachos</prn> is said, on the occasion when an <pl id='Q16562724'>Eretrian</pl> fleet put into <pl id='Q56259452'>Tanagra</pl> from <pl id='Q173096'>Euboea</pl>, to have led out the youths to the battle; he himself, armed with a scraper like a youth, was chiefly responsible for the rout of the <pl id='Q173096'>Euboeans</pl>. In the sanctuary of the <prn id='Q107244115'>Promachos</prn> is kept all that is left of the wild strawberry-tree under which they believe that <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> was nourished. Near by is a theater and by it a portico. I consider that the people of <pl id='Q56259452'>Tanagra</pl> have better arrangements for the worship of the gods than any other Greeks. For their houses are in one place, while the sanctuaries are apart beyond the houses in a clear space where no men live. </p>
<p id='9.22.3'><b>9.22.3</b> <prn id='Q241132'>Corinna</prn>, the only lyric poetess of <pl id='Q56259452'>Tanagra</pl>, has her tomb in a, conspicuous part of the city, and in the gymnasium is a painting of <prn id='Q241132'>Corinna</prn> binding her head with a fillet for the victory she won over <prn id='Q134929'>Pindar</prn> at <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> with a lyric poem. I believe that her victory was partly due to the dialect she used, for she composed, not in <prn id='Q285494'>Doric</prn> speech like <prn id='Q134929'>Pindar</prn>, but in one <pl id='Q255325'>Aeolians</pl> would understand, and partly to her being, if one may judge from the likeness, the most beautiful woman of her time. </p>
<p id='9.22.4'><b>9.22.4</b> Here there are two breeds of cocks, the fighters and the blackbirds, as they are called. The size of these blackbirds is the same as that of the <pl id='Q620765'>Lydian</pl> birds, but in color they are like <prn id='Q43365'>crows</prn>, while wattles and comb are very like the anemone. They have small, white markings on the end of the beak and at the end of the tail. </p>
<p id='9.22.5'><b>9.22.5</b> Such is the appearance of the blackbirds. Within <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl> to the left of the <pl id='Q1137741'>Euripus</pl> is Mount <pl id='Q25019011'>Messapion</pl>, at the foot of which on the coast is the <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotian</pl> city of <pl id='Q2857905'>Anthedon</pl>. Some say that the city received its name from a nymph called <prn id='Q3618401'>Anthedon</prn>, while others say that one <prn id='Q3618450'>Anthas</prn> was despot here, a son of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> by <prn id='Q763268'>Alcyone</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q130818'>Atlas</prn>. Just about the center of <pl id='Q2857905'>Anthedon</pl> is a sanctuary of the <prn id='Q940138'>Cabeiri</prn>, with a grove around it, near which is a temple of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> and her daughter, with images of white marble. </p>
<p id='9.22.6'><b>9.22.6</b> There are a sanctuary and an image of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> in front of the city on the side towards the mainland. Here are the graves of the children of <prn id='Q1672201'>Iphimedeia</prn> and <prn id='Q1471633'>Aloeus</prn>. They met their end at the hands of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> according to both <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> and <prn id='Q134929'>Pindar</prn>, the latter adding that their doom overtook them in <pl id='Q96575378'>Naxos</pl>, which lies off <pl id='Q65040323'>Paros</pl>. Their tombs then are in <pl id='Q2857905'>Anthedon</pl>, and by the sea is what is called the Leap of <prn id='Q385397'>Glaucus</prn>. </p>
<p id='9.22.7'><b>9.22.7</b> That <prn id='Q385397'>Glaucus</prn> was a fisherman, who, on eating of the grass, turned into a deity of the sea and ever since has foretold to men the future, is a belief generally accepted; in particular, seafaring men tell every year many a tale about the soothsaying of <prn id='Q385397'>Glaucus</prn>. <prn id='Q134929'>Pindar</prn> and <prn id='Q40939'>Aeschylus</prn> got a story about <prn id='Q385397'>Glaucus</prn> from the people of <pl id='Q2857905'>Anthedon</pl>. <prn id='Q134929'>Pindar</prn> has not thought fit to say much about him in his odes, but the story actually supplied <prn id='Q40939'>Aeschylus</prn> with material for a play. </p>
<p id='9.23.1'><b>9.23.1</b> In front of the <pl id='Q106526373'>Proetidian gate</pl> at <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> is the gymnasium called the Gymnasium of <prn id='Q504076'>Iolaus</prn> and also a race-course, a bank of earth like the <pl id='Q4357227'>stadium</pl> at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> and <pl id='Q22681278'>that</pl> of <pl id='Q7698713'>Epidaurus</pl>. Here there is also shown a hero-shrine of <prn id='Q504076'>Iolaus</prn>. That <prn id='Q504076'>Iolaus</prn> himself died in <pl id='Q3760293'>Sardinia</pl> along with the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> and <pl id='Q1141295'>Thespians</pl> who made the crossing with him is admitted even by the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> themselves. </p>
<p id='9.23.2'><b>9.23.2</b> Crossing over the right side of the course you come to a race-course for <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn>, in which is the tomb of <prn id='Q134929'>Pindar</prn>. When <prn id='Q134929'>Pindar</prn> was a young man he was once on his way to <pl id='Q1141295'>Thespiae</pl> in the hot season. At about noon he was seized with fatigue and the drowsiness that follows it, so just as he was, he lay down a little way above the road. As he slept <prn id='Q102857'>bees</prn> alighted on him and plastered his lips with their wax. </p>
<p id='9.23.3'><b>9.23.3</b> Such was the beginning of <prn id='Q134929'>Pindar</prn>'s career as a lyric poet. When his reputation had already spread throughout Greece he was raised to a greater height of fame by an order of the <prn id='Q220344'>Pythian priestess</prn>, who bade the <pl id='Q75459'>Delphians</pl> give to <prn id='Q134929'>Pindar</prn> one half of all the first-fruits they offered to <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>. It is also said that on reaching old age a vision came to him in a dream. As he slept <prn id='Q45967'>Persephone</prn> stood by him and declared that she alone of the deities had not been honored by <prn id='Q134929'>Pindar</prn> with a hymn, but that <prn id='Q134929'>Pindar</prn> would compose an ode to her also when he had come to her. </p>
<p id='9.23.4'><b>9.23.4</b> <prn id='Q134929'>Pindar</prn> died at once, before ten days had passed since the dream. But there was in <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> an old woman related by birth to <prn id='Q134929'>Pindar</prn> who had practised singing most of his odes. By her side in a dream stood <prn id='Q134929'>Pindar</prn>, and sang a hymn to <prn id='Q45967'>Persephone</prn>. Immediately on waking out of her sleep she wrote down all she had heard him singing in her dream. In this song, among the epithets he applies to <pl id='Q1521549'>Hades</pl> is “golden-reined” — a clear reference to the rape of <prn id='Q45967'>Persephone</prn>. </p>
<p id='9.23.5'><b>9.23.5</b> From this point to <pl id='Q15394073'>Acraephnium</pl> is mainly flat. They say that originally the city formed part of the territory belonging to <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>, and I learned that in later times men of <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> escaped to it, at the time when <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn> destroyed <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>. Weak and old, they could not even get safely away to <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl>, but made their homes here. The town lies on Mount <pl id='Q1275456'>Ptoon</pl>, and there are here a temple and image of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> that are worth seeing. </p>
<p id='9.23.6'><b>9.23.6</b> About fifteen stades away from the city on the right is the sanctuary of <pl id='Q94522462'>Ptoan</pl> <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>. We are told by <prn id='Q730625'>Asius</prn> in his epic that Ptous, who gave a surname to <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> and the name to the <pl id='Q1275456'>mountain</pl>, was a son of <prn id='Q143880'>Athamas</prn> by <prn id='Q1458587'>Themisto</prn>. Before the expedition of the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> under <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn>, in which <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> was destroyed, there was here an oracle that never lied. Once too a man of <pl id='Q1375099'>Europus</pl>, of the name of <prn id='Q106584208'>Mys</prn>, who was sent by <prn id='Q155063'>Mardonius</prn>, inquired of the god in his own language, and the god too gave a response, not in Greek but in the <pl id='Q193214'>Carian</pl> speech. </p>
<p id='9.23.7'><b>9.23.7</b> On crossing Mount <pl id='Q1275456'>Ptoon</pl> you come to <pl id='Q13580770'>Larymna</pl>, a <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotian</pl> city on the coast, said to have been named after <prn id='Q106584309'>Larymna</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q12879792'>Cynus</prn>. Her earlier ancestors I shall give in my account of <pl id='Q3354839'>Locris</pl>. Of old <pl id='Q13580770'>Larymna</pl> belonged to <pl id='Q771434'>Opus</pl>, but when <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> rose to great power the citizens of their own accord joined the <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotians</pl>. Here there is a temple of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> with a standing image. The town has a harbor with deep water near the shore, and on the mountains commanding the city wild <prn id='Q58697'>boars</prn> can be hunted. </p>
<p id='9.24.1'><b>9.24.1</b> On the straight road from <pl id='Q15394073'>Acraephnium</pl> to the <pl id='Q1235405'>Cephisian</pl>, or as it is also called, the <pl id='Q1234240'>Copaic Lake</pl>, is what is styled the Athamantian Plain, on which, they say, <prn id='Q143880'>Athamas</prn> made his home. Into the lake flows the river <pl id='Q1235405'>Cephisus</pl>, which rises at <pl id='Q1267602'>Lilaea</pl> in <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl>, and on sailing across it you come to <pl id='Q5168569'>Copae</pl>, a town lying on the shore of the lake. <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> mentions it in the <prn id='Q1233048'>Catalogue</prn>. Here is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>, one of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> and a third of <prn id='Q214554'>Serapis</prn>. </p>
<p id='9.24.2'><b>9.24.2</b> According to the <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotians</pl> there were once other inhabited towns near the lake, <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> and <pl id='Q11918833'>Eleusis</pl>, but there occurred a flood one winter which destroyed them. The fish of the <pl id='Q1235405'>Cephisian</pl> Lake are in general no different from those of other lakes, but the eels there are of great size and very pleasant to the palate. </p>
<p id='9.24.3'><b>9.24.3</b> On the left of <pl id='Q5168569'>Copae</pl> about twelve stades from it is <pl id='Q12872591'>Olmones</pl>, and some seven stades distant from <pl id='Q12872591'>Olmones</pl> is <pl id='Q12872650'>Hyettus</pl> both right from their foundation to the present day have been villages. In my view <pl id='Q12872650'>Hyettus</pl>, as well as the Athamantian plain, belongs to the district of <pl id='Q1855083'>Orchomenus</pl>. All the stories I heard about <pl id='Q12872650'>Hyettus</pl> the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl> and Olmus, the son of <prn id='Q102561'>Sisyphus</prn>, I shall include in my history of <pl id='Q1855083'>Orchomenus</pl>. In <pl id='Q12872591'>Olmones</pl> they did not show me anything that was in the least worth seeing, but in <pl id='Q12872650'>Hyettus</pl> is a temple of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, from whom the sick may get cures. There is an image not carefully carved, but of unwrought stone after the ancient fashion. </p>
<p id='9.24.4'><b>9.24.4</b> About twenty stades away from <pl id='Q12872650'>Hyettus</pl> is <pl id='Q13580763'>Cyrtones</pl>. The ancient name of the town was, they say, Cyrtone. It is built on a high mountain, and here are a temple and grove of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>. There are also standing images of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> and <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>. There is here too a cool stream of water rising from a rock. By the spring is a sanctuary of the nymphs, and a small grove, in which all the trees alike are cultivated. </p>
<p id='9.24.5'><b>9.24.5</b> Going out of <pl id='Q13580763'>Cyrtones</pl>, as you cross the mountain you come to <pl id='Q13580762'>Corseia</pl>, under which is a grove of trees that are not cultivated, being mostly evergreen oaks. A small image of <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> stands in the open part of the grove. This is distant from <pl id='Q13580762'>Corseia</pl> about half a stade. On descending to the level you reach a river called the Platanius, which flows into the sea. On the right of the river the last of the <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotians</pl> in this part dwell in <pl id='Q15632345'>Halae</pl>-on-Sea, which separates the <pl id='Q3354839'>Locrian</pl> mainland from <pl id='Q173096'>Euboea</pl>. </p>
<p id='9.25.1'><b>9.25.1</b> Very near to the <pl id='Q106526386'>Neistan gate</pl> at <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> is the tomb of <prn id='Q744871'>Menoeceus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q732066'>Creon</prn>. He committed suicide in obedience to the oracle from <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>, at the time when <prn id='Q334817'>Polyneices</prn> and the host with him arrived from <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>. On the tomb of <prn id='Q744871'>Menoeceus</prn> grows a pomegranate-tree. If you break through the outer part of the ripe fruit, you will then find the inside like blood. This pomegranate-tree is still flourishing. The <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> assert that they were the first men among whom the vine grew, but they have now no memorial of it to show. </p>
<p id='9.25.2'><b>9.25.2</b> Not far from the grave of <prn id='Q744871'>Menoeceus</prn> is the place where they say the sons of <prn id='Q130890'>Oedipus</prn> killed each other in a duel. The scene of their fight is marked by a pillar, upon which is a stone shield. There is shown a place where according to the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> was deceived by <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> into giving the breast to <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> when he was a baby. The whole of this place is called the Dragging of <prn id='Q131351'>Antigone</prn>. For when she found that she had not the strength to lift the body of <prn id='Q334817'>Polyneices</prn>, in spite of her eager efforts, a second plan occurred to her, to drag him. So she dragged him right up to the burning pyre of <prn id='Q506550'>Eteocles</prn> and threw him on it. </p>
<p id='9.25.3'><b>9.25.3</b> There is a river called <pl id='Q106226259'>Dirce</pl> after the wife of <prn id='Q1047047'>Lycus</prn>. The story goes that <prn id='Q461439'>Antiope</prn> was ill-treated by this <prn id='Q850192'>Dirce</prn>, and therefore the children of <prn id='Q461439'>Antiope</prn> put <prn id='Q850192'>Dirce</prn> to death. Crossing the river you reach the ruins of the house of <prn id='Q134929'>Pindar</prn>, and a sanctuary of the <prn id='Q188236'>Mother</prn> <pl id='Q5278019'>Dindymene</pl>. <prn id='Q134929'>Pindar</prn> dedicated the image, and <prn id='Q16170207'>Aristomedes</prn> and <prn id='Q11950676'>Socrates</prn>, sculptors of <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>, made it. Their custom is to open the sanctuary on one day in each year, and no more. It was my fortune to arrive on that day, and I saw the image, which, like the throne, is of <pl id='Q1125206'>Pentelic</pl> marble. </p>
<p id='9.25.4'><b>9.25.4</b> Along the road from the <pl id='Q106526386'>Neistan gate</pl> are three sanctuaries. There is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q159168'>Themis</prn>, with an image of white marble; adjoining it is a sanctuary of the <prn id='Q180287'>Fates</prn>, while the third is of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q4693579'>Agoraios</prn>. <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> is made of stone; the <prn id='Q180287'>Fates</prn> have no images. A little farther off in the open stands <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, surnamed <prn id='Q107349838'>Nose-docker</prn>; the reason for the name is, as the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> say, that <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> cut off the noses, as an insult, of the heralds who came from <pl id='Q1855083'>Orchomenus</pl> to demand the tribute. </p>
<p id='9.25.5'><b>9.25.5</b> Advancing from here twenty-five stades you come to a grove of Cabeirean <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> and <prn id='Q45967'>Kore</prn>. The initiated are permitted to enter it. The <pl id='Q15206356'>sanctuary of the Cabeiri</pl> is some seven stades distant from this grove. I must ask the curious to forgive me if I keep silence as to who the <prn id='Q940138'>Cabeiri</prn> are, and what is the nature of the ritual performed in honor of them and of the <prn id='Q188236'>Mother</prn>. </p>
<p id='9.25.6'><b>9.25.6</b> But there is nothing to prevent my declaring to all what the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> say was the origin of the ritual. They say that once there was in this place a city, with inhabitants called <prn id='Q940138'>Cabeiri</prn>; and that <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> came to know <prn id='Q83160'>Prometheus</prn>, one of the <prn id='Q940138'>Cabeiri</prn>, and Aetnaeus his son, and entrusted something to their keeping. What was entrusted to them, and what happened to it, seemed to me a sin to put into writing, but at any rate the rites are a gift of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> to the <prn id='Q940138'>Cabeiraeans</prn>. </p>
<p id='9.25.7'><b>9.25.7</b> At the time of the invasion of the Epigoni and the taking of <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>, the <prn id='Q940138'>Cabeiraeans</prn> were expelled from their homes by the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> and the rites for a while ceased to be performed. But they go on to say that afterwards <prn id='Q106621913'>Pelarge</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q106879981'>Potnieus</prn>, and <prn id='Q12878200'>Isthmiades</prn> her husband established the mysteries here to begin with, but transferred them to the place called Alexiarus. </p>
<p id='9.25.8'><b>9.25.8</b> But because <prn id='Q106621913'>Pelarge</prn> conducted the initiation outside the ancient borders, <prn id='Q106880009'>Telondes</prn> and those who were left of the clan of the <prn id='Q940138'>Cabeiri</prn> returned again to Cabeiraea. Various honors were to be established for <prn id='Q106621913'>Pelarge</prn> by <prn id='Q106880009'>Telondes</prn> in accordance with an oracle from <pl id='Q382317'>Dodona</pl>, one being the sacrifice of a pregnant victim. The wrath of the <prn id='Q940138'>Cabeiri</prn> no man may placate, as has been proved on many occasions. </p>
<p id='9.25.9'><b>9.25.9</b> For certain private people dared to perform in <pl id='Q782278'>Naupactus</pl> the ritual just as it was done in <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>, and soon afterwards justice overtook them. Then, again, certain men of the army of <prn id='Q129165'>Xerxes</prn> left behind with <prn id='Q155063'>Mardonius</prn> in <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl> entered the <pl id='Q15206356'>sanctuary of the Cabeiri</pl>, perhaps in the hope of great wealth, but rather, I suspect, to show their contempt of its gods; all these immediately were struck with madness, and flung themselves to their deaths into the sea or from the tops of precipices. </p>
<p id='9.25.10'><b>9.25.10</b> Again, when <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn> after his victory wasted with fire all the <pl id='Q768515'>Thebaid</pl>, including <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> itself, some men from <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl> entered the <pl id='Q15206356'>sanctuary of the Cabeiri</pl>, as it was in enemy territory, and were destroyed by thunder and lightning from heaven. </p>
<p id='9.26.1'><b>9.26.1</b> So sacred this sanctuary has been from the beginning. On the right of the sanctuary is a <pl id='Q106880398'>plain</pl> named after <prn id='Q60791518'>Tenerus</prn> the seer, whom they hold to be a son of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> by <prn id='Q785598'>Melia</prn>; there is also a large sanctuary of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> surnamed <prn id='Q106880218'>Hippodetus</prn> (Binder of <prn id='Q726'>Horses</prn>). For they say that the <pl id='Q1855083'>Orchomenians</pl> came to this place with an army, and that <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> by night took their chariot-<prn id='Q726'>horses</prn> and bound them tight. </p>
<p id='9.26.2'><b>9.26.2</b> Farther on we come to the mountain from which they say the <prn id='Q9335858'>Sphinx</prn>, chanting a riddle, sallied to bring death upon those she caught. Others say that roving with a force of ships on a <prn id='Q10729326'>piratical</prn> expedition she put in at <pl id='Q2857905'>Anthedon</pl>, seized the mountain I mentioned, and used it for plundering raids until <prn id='Q130890'>Oedipus</prn> overwhelmed her by the superior numbers of the army he had with him on his arrival from <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl>. </p>
<p id='9.26.3'><b>9.26.3</b> There is another version of the story which makes her the natural daughter of <prn id='Q463898'>Laius</prn>, who, because he was fond of her, told her the oracle delivered to <prn id='Q27613'>Cadmus</prn> from <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>. No one, they say, except the kings knew the oracle. Now <prn id='Q463898'>Laius</prn> (the story goes on to say) had sons by concubines, and the oracle delivered from <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> applied only to <prn id='Q131445'>Epicaste</prn> and her sons. So when any of her brothers came in order to claim the throne from the <prn id='Q9335858'>Sphinx</prn>, she resorted to trickery in dealing with them, saying that if they were sons of <prn id='Q463898'>Laius</prn> they should know the oracle that came to <prn id='Q27613'>Cadmus</prn>. </p>
<p id='9.26.4'><b>9.26.4</b> When they could not answer she would punish them with death, on the ground that they had no valid claim to the kingdom or to relationship. But <prn id='Q130890'>Oedipus</prn> came because it appears he had been told the oracle in a dream. </p>
<p id='9.26.5'><b>9.26.5</b> Distant from this mountain fifteen stades are the ruins of the city <pl id='Q3063303'>Onchestus</pl>. They say that here dwelt <prn id='Q15838246'>Onchestus</prn>, a son of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>. In my day there remained a temple and image of Onchestian <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, and the grove which <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> too praised. </p>
<p id='9.26.6'><b>9.26.6</b> Taking a turn left from the <pl id='Q15206356'>Cabeirian sanctuary</pl>, and advancing about fifty stades, you come to <pl id='Q1141295'>Thespiae</pl>, built at the foot of Mount <pl id='Q215516'>Helicon</pl>. They say that <prn id='Q6143496'>Thespia</prn> was a daughter of <pl id='Q2737429'>Asopus</pl>, who gave her name to the city, while others say that <prn id='Q952188'>Thespius</prn>, who was descended from <prn id='Q301219'>Erechtheus</prn>, came from <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> and was the man after whom the city was called. </p>
<p id='9.26.7'><b>9.26.7</b> In <pl id='Q1141295'>Thespiae</pl> is a bronze image of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q107248301'>Saotes</prn> (Saviour). They say about it that when a dragon once was devastating their city, the god commanded that every year one of their youths, upon whom the lot fell, should be offered to the monster. Now the names of those who perished they say that they do not remember. But when the lot fell on <prn id='Q3680531'>Cleostratus</prn>, his lover <prn id='Q107304147'>Menestratus</prn>, they say, devised a trick. </p>
<p id='9.26.8'><b>9.26.8</b> He had made a bronze breastplate, with a fish-hook, the point turned outwards, upon each of its plates. Clad in this breastplate he gave himself up, of his own free will, to the dragon, convinced that having done so he would, though destroyed himself, prove the destroyer of the monster. This is why the <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> has been surnamed <prn id='Q107248301'>Saotes</prn>. The image of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>, and also that of <prn id='Q213440'>Fortune</prn>, and in another place that of <prn id='Q202257'>Health</prn> . . . But the <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> <prn id='Q1350313'>Ergane</prn>, as well as <prn id='Q205251'>Wealth</prn>, who stands beside her, was made by. . . . </p>
<p id='9.27.1'><b>9.27.1</b> Of the gods the <pl id='Q1141295'>Thespians</pl> have from the beginning honored <prn id='Q121973'>Eros</prn> most, and they have a very ancient image of him, an unwrought stone. Who established among the <pl id='Q1141295'>Thespians</pl> the custom of worshipping <prn id='Q121973'>Eros</prn> more than any other god I do not know. He is worshipped equally by the people of <pl id='Q1411652'>Parium</pl> on the <pl id='Q6514'>Hellespont</pl>, who were originally colonists from <pl id='Q723091'>Erythrae</pl> in <pl id='Q620874'>Ionia</pl>, but today are subject to the Romans. </p>
<p id='9.27.2'><b>9.27.2</b> Most men consider <prn id='Q121973'>Eros</prn> to be the youngest of the gods and the son of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>. But <prn id='Q978308'>Olen</prn> the <pl id='Q18927'>Lycian</pl>, who composed the oldest Greek hymns, says in a hymn to <prn id='Q94066'>Eileithyia</prn> that she was the mother of <prn id='Q121973'>Eros</prn>. Later than <prn id='Q978308'>Olen</prn>, both <prn id='Q11939948'>Pamphos</prn> and <prn id='Q174353'>Orpheus</prn> wrote hexameter verse, and composed poems on <prn id='Q121973'>Eros</prn>, in order that they might be among those sung by the <prn id='Q31789671'>Lycomidae</prn> to accompany the ritual. I read them after conversation with a Torchbearer. Of these things I will make no further mention. <prn id='Q44233'>Hesiod</prn>, or he who wrote the <prn id='Q156498'>Theogony</prn> fathered on <prn id='Q44233'>Hesiod</prn>, writes, I know, that <prn id='Q131090'>Chaos</prn> was born first, and after <prn id='Q131090'>Chaos</prn>, <prn id='Q93172'>Earth</prn>, <prn id='Q101322'>Tartarus</prn> and <prn id='Q121973'>Eros</prn>. </p>
<p id='9.27.3'><b>9.27.3</b> <prn id='Q17892'>Sappho</prn> of <pl id='Q128087'>Lesbos</pl> wrote many poems about <prn id='Q121973'>Eros</prn>, but they are not consistent. Later on <prn id='Q192222'>Lysippus</prn> made a bronze <prn id='Q121973'>Eros</prn> for the <pl id='Q1141295'>Thespians</pl>, and previously <prn id='Q105290'>Praxiteles</prn> one of <pl id='Q1125206'>Pentelic</pl> marble. The story of <prn id='Q232790'>Phryne</prn> and the trick she played on <prn id='Q105290'>Praxiteles</prn> I have related in another place. The first to remove the image of <prn id='Q121973'>Eros</prn>, it is said, was Gaius the Roman Emperor; <prn id='Q1411'>Claudius</prn>, they say, sent it back to <pl id='Q1141295'>Thespiae</pl>, but <prn id='Q1413'>Nero</prn> carried it away a second time. </p>
<p id='9.27.4'><b>9.27.4</b> At <pl id='Q18287233'>Rome</pl> the image perished by fire. Of the pair who sinned against the god, Gaius was killed by a private soldier, just as he was giving the password; he had made the soldier very angry by always giving the same password with a covert sneer. The other, <prn id='Q1413'>Nero</prn>, in addition to his violence to his mother, committed accursed and hateful crimes against his wedded wives. The modern <prn id='Q121973'>Eros</prn> at <pl id='Q1141295'>Thespiae</pl> was made by the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> <prn id='Q1175941'>Menodorus</prn>, who copied the work of <prn id='Q105290'>Praxiteles</prn>. </p>
<p id='9.27.5'><b>9.27.5</b> Here too are statues made by <prn id='Q105290'>Praxiteles</prn> himself, one of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> and one of <prn id='Q232790'>Phryne</prn>, both <prn id='Q232790'>Phryne</prn> and the goddess being of stone. Elsewhere too is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> Melainis (black), and a theater and an agora, well worth seeing. Here is set up <prn id='Q44233'>Hesiod</prn> in bronze. Not far from the agora is a <prn id='Q165023'>Nike</prn> of bronze and a small temple of the <prn id='Q66016'>Muses</prn>. In it are small agalmata made of stone. </p>
<p id='9.27.6'><b>9.27.6</b> At <pl id='Q1141295'>Thespiae</pl> is also a sanctuary of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>. The priestess there is a virgin, who acts as such until she dies. The reason of this is said to be as follows. <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, they say, had intercourse with the fifty daughters of <prn id='Q768822'>Thestius</prn>, except one, in a single night. She was the only one who refused to have connection with him. <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, thinking that he had been insulted, condemned her to remain a virgin all her life, serving him as his priest. </p>
<p id='9.27.7'><b>9.27.7</b> I have heard another story, how <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> had connection with all the virgin daughters of <prn id='Q768822'>Thestius</prn> in one and the same night, and how they all bore him sons, the youngest and the eldest bearing twins. But I cannot think it credible that <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> would rise to such a pitch of wrath against a daughter of a friend. Moreover, while he was still among men, punishing them for insolence, and especially such as were impious towards the gods, he would not himself have set up a temple and appointed a priestess to himself, just as though he were a god. </p>
<p id='9.27.8'><b>9.27.8</b> As a matter of fact this sanctuary seemed to me too old to be of the time of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> the son of <prn id='Q206214'>Amphitryon</prn>, and to belong to <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> called one of the <pl id='Q83659'>Idaean</pl> <prn id='Q831589'>Dactyls</prn>, to whom I found the people of <pl id='Q723091'>Erythrae</pl> in <pl id='Q620874'>Ionia</pl> and of <pl id='Q58455019'>Tyre</pl> possessed sanctuaries. Nevertheless, the <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotians</pl> were not unacquainted with this name of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, seeing that they themselves say that the sanctuary of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> of <pl id='Q1529070'>Mycalessus</pl> has been entrusted to <pl id='Q83659'>Idaean</pl> <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>. </p>
<p id='9.28.1'><b>9.28.1</b> <pl id='Q215516'>Helicon</pl> is one of the mountains of Greece with the most fertile soil and the greatest number of cultivated trees. The wild-strawberry bushes supply to the <prn id='Q2934'>goats</prn> sweeter fruit than that growing anywhere else. The dwellers around <pl id='Q215516'>Helicon</pl> say that all the grasses too and roots growing on the mountain are not at all poisonous to men. Moreover, the food makes the poison of the <prn id='Q2102'>snakes</prn> too less deadly, so that most of those bitten escape with their lives, should they fall in with a Libyan of the race of the <prn id='Q268467'>Psyllians</prn>, or with any suitable remedies. </p>
<p id='9.28.2'><b>9.28.2</b> Now the poison of the most venomous <prn id='Q192056'>snakes</prn> is of itself deadly to men and all animals alike, but what they feed on contributes very much to the strength of their poison; for instance, I learnt from a <pl id='Q41642'>Phoenician</pl> that the roots they eat make more venomous the <prn id='Q192056'>vipers</prn> in the highland of <pl id='Q41642'>Phoenicia</pl>. He said that he had himself seen a man trying to escape from the rush of a <prn id='Q192056'>viper</prn>; the man, he said, ran up a tree, but the <prn id='Q192056'>viper</prn>, coming up too late, puffed some of its poison towards the tree, and the man died instantaneously. </p>
<p id='9.28.3'><b>9.28.3</b> Such was the story I heard from him. Those <prn id='Q192056'>vipers</prn> in <pl id='Q57751375'>Arabia</pl> that nest around the balsam trees have, I know, the following peculiarities. The balsams are about as big as a myrtle bush, and their leaves are like those of the herb marjoram. The <prn id='Q192056'>vipers</prn> of <pl id='Q57751375'>Arabia</pl> lodge in certain numbers, larger or smaller, under each tree. For the balsam-juice is the food they like most, and moreover they are fond of the shade of the bushes. </p>
<p id='9.28.4'><b>9.28.4</b> So when the time has come for the <pl id='Q57751375'>Arabians</pl> to collect the juice of the balsam, each man takes two sticks to the <prn id='Q192056'>vipers</prn>, and by striking them together they drive the <prn id='Q192056'>vipers</prn> away. Kill them they will not, considering them sacred to the balsam. And even if a man should have the misfortune to be bitten by the <prn id='Q192056'>vipers</prn>, though the wound is like the cut of a knife, nevertheless there is no fear from the poison. For as the <prn id='Q192056'>vipers</prn> feed on the most fragrant of perfumes, their poison is mitigated and less deadly. </p>
<p id='9.29.1'><b>9.29.1</b> Such is the truth about these things. The first to sacrifice on <pl id='Q215516'>Helicon</pl> to the <prn id='Q66016'>Muses</prn> and to call the <pl id='Q7912361'>mountain sacred</pl> to the <prn id='Q66016'>Muses</prn> were, they say, <prn id='Q957340'>Ephialtes</prn> and <prn id='Q18551588'>Otus</prn>, who also founded <pl id='Q936920'>Ascra</pl>. To this also <prn id='Q764766'>Hegesinus</prn> alludes in his poem <prn id='Q11853325'>Atthis</prn>: “And again with <prn id='Q10419837'>Ascra</prn> lay <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> Earth-shaker, Who when the year revolved bore him a son <prn id='Q106619538'>Oeoclus</prn>, who first with the <prn id='Q909765'>children of Aloeus</prn> founded <pl id='Q936920'>Ascra</pl>, which lies at the foot of <pl id='Q215516'>Helicon</pl>, rich in springs.” </p>
<p id='9.29.2'><b>9.29.2</b> This poem of <prn id='Q764766'>Hegesinus</prn> I have not read, for it was no longer extant when I was born. But <prn id='Q11910954'>Callippus</prn> of <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl> in his history of <pl id='Q1855083'>Orchomenus</pl> uses the verses of <prn id='Q764766'>Hegesinus</prn> as evidence in support of his own views, and I too have done likewise, using the quotation of <prn id='Q11910954'>Callippus</prn> himself. Of <pl id='Q936920'>Ascra</pl> in my day nothing memorable was left except one <pl id='Q106298096'>tower</pl>. The sons of <prn id='Q1471633'>Aloeus</prn> held that the <prn id='Q66016'>Muses</prn> were three in number, and gave them the names of <prn id='Q505207'>Melete</prn> (practice), <prn id='Q690388'>Mneme</prn> (memory) and <prn id='Q176283'>Aoede</prn> (song). </p>
<p id='9.29.3'><b>9.29.3</b> But they say that afterwards <prn id='Q21567935'>Pierus</prn>, a <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonian</pl>, after whom the mountain in <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl> was named, came to <pl id='Q1141295'>Thespiae</pl> and established nine <prn id='Q66016'>Muses</prn>, changing their names to the present ones. <prn id='Q21567935'>Pierus</prn> was of this opinion either because it seemed to him wiser, or because an oracle so ordered, or having so learned from one of the <pl id='Q41741'>Thracians</pl>. For the <pl id='Q41741'>Thracians</pl> had the reputation of old of being more clever than the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl>, and in particular of being not so careless in religious matters. </p>
<p id='9.29.4'><b>9.29.4</b> There are some who say that <prn id='Q21567935'>Pierus</prn> himself had nine daughters, that their names were the same as those of the goddesses, and that those whom the Greeks called the children of the <prn id='Q66016'>Muses</prn> were sons of the daughters of <prn id='Q21567935'>Pierus</prn>. <prn id='Q316129'>Mimnermus</prn>, who composed elegiac verses about the battle between the <pl id='Q1379299'>Smyrnaeans</pl> and the <pl id='Q620765'>Lydians</pl> under <prn id='Q312537'>Gyges</prn>, says in the preface that the elder <prn id='Q66016'>Muses</prn> are daughters of <prn id='Q79999'>Uranus</prn>, and that there are other and younger <prn id='Q66016'>Muses</prn>, children of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>. </p>
<p id='9.29.5'><b>9.29.5</b> On <pl id='Q215516'>Helicon</pl>, on the left as you go to the <pl id='Q7912361'>grove</pl> of the <prn id='Q66016'>Muses</prn>, is the spring <prn id='Q390448'>Aganippe</prn>; they say that <prn id='Q390448'>Aganippe</prn> was a daughter of the <pl id='Q60791088'>Termessos</pl>, which flows round <pl id='Q215516'>Helicon</pl>. As you go along the straight road to the grove is a portrait of <prn id='Q10490777'>Eupheme</prn> carved in relief on a stone. She was, they say, the nurse of the <prn id='Q66016'>Muses</prn>. </p>
<p id='9.29.6'><b>9.29.6</b> So her portrait is here, and after it is <prn id='Q647496'>Linus</prn> on a small rock worked into the shape of a cave. To <prn id='Q647496'>Linus</prn> every year they sacrifice as to a hero before they sacrifice to the <prn id='Q66016'>Muses</prn>. It is said that this <prn id='Q647496'>Linus</prn> was a son of <prn id='Q104002'>Urania</prn> and <prn id='Q17521227'>Amphimarus</prn>, a son of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, that he won a reputation for music greater than that of any contemporary or predecessor, and that <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> killed him for being his rival in singing. </p>
<p id='9.29.7'><b>9.29.7</b> On the death of <prn id='Q647496'>Linus</prn>, mourning for him spread, it seems, to all the foreign world, so that even among the <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptians</pl> there came to be a <prn id='Q647496'>Linus</prn> song, in the <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptian</pl> language called ManerosYY. Of the Greek poets, <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> shows that he knew that the sufferings of <prn id='Q647496'>Linus</prn> were the theme of a Greek song when he says that <prn id='Q44384'>Hephaestus</prn>, among the other scenes he worked upon the shield of <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn>, represented a boy harpist singing the <prn id='Q647496'>Linus</prn> song: “In the midst of them a boy on a clear-toned lyre <br>Played with great charm, and to his playing sang of beautiful <prn id='Q647496'>Linus</prn>.” </p>
<p id='9.29.8'><b>9.29.8</b> <prn id='Q11939948'>Pamphos</prn>, who composed the oldest <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> hymns, called him OetolinusYY (<prn id='Q647496'>Linus</prn> doomed) at the time when the mourning for <prn id='Q647496'>Linus</prn> was at its height. <prn id='Q17892'>Sappho</prn> of <pl id='Q128087'>Lesbos</pl>, who learnt the name of OetolinusYY from the epic poetry of <prn id='Q11939948'>Pamphos</prn>, sang of both <prn id='Q163920'>Adonis</prn> and OetolinusYY together. The <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> assert that <prn id='Q647496'>Linus</prn> was buried among them, and that after the Greek defeat at <pl id='Q13574678'>Chaeroneia</pl>, <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn> the son of <prn id='Q313907'>Amyntas</prn>, in obedience to a vision in a dream, took up the bones of <prn id='Q647496'>Linus</prn> and conveyed them to <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl>; </p>
<p id='9.29.9'><b>9.29.9</b> other visions induced him to send the bones of <prn id='Q647496'>Linus</prn> back to <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>. But all that was over the grave, and whatever marks were on it, vanished, they say, with the lapse of time. Other tales are told by the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl>, how that later than this <prn id='Q647496'>Linus</prn> there was born another, called the son of <prn id='Q37340'>Ismenius</prn>, a teacher of music, and how <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, while still a child, killed him. But hexameter poetry was written neither by <prn id='Q647496'>Linus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q17521227'>Amphimarus</prn> nor by the later <prn id='Q647496'>Linus</prn>; or if it was, it has not survived for posterity. </p>
<p id='9.30.1'><b>9.30.1</b> The first <pl id='Q7912361'>images</pl> of the <prn id='Q66016'>Muses</prn> are of them all, from the hand of <prn id='Q378772'>Cephisodotus</prn>, while a little farther on are three, also from the hand of <prn id='Q378772'>Cephisodotus</prn>, and three more by <prn id='Q3976117'>Strongylion</prn>, an excellent artist of <prn id='Q473194'>oxen</prn> and <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn>. The remaining three were made by <prn id='Q11939329'>Olympiosthenes</prn>. There is also on <pl id='Q215516'>Helicon</pl> a bronze <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> fighting with <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> for the lyre. There is also a <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> by <prn id='Q192222'>Lysippus</prn>; the standing image, however, of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>, that <prn id='Q483783'>Sulla</prn> dedicated, is the most noteworthy of the works of <prn id='Q192211'>Myron</prn> after the <prn id='Q301219'>Erechtheus</prn> at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>. What he dedicated was not his own; he took it away from the <prn id='Q1065225'>Minyae</prn> of <pl id='Q1855083'>Orchomenus</pl>. This is an illustration of the Greek proverb, “to worship the gods with other people's incense.” </p>
<p id='9.30.2'><b>9.30.2</b> Of poets or famous musicians they have set up likenesses of the following. There is <prn id='Q853014'>Thamyris</prn> himself, when already blind, with a broken lyre in his hand, and <prn id='Q312422'>Arion</prn> of <pl id='Q38281278'>Methymna</pl> upon a <prn id='Q7369'>dolphin</prn>. The sculptor who made the statue of <prn id='Q3944390'>Sacadas</prn> of <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>, not understanding the prelude of <prn id='Q134929'>Pindar</prn> about him, has made the flute-player with a body no bigger than his flute. </p>
<p id='9.30.3'><b>9.30.3</b> <prn id='Q44233'>Hesiod</prn> too sits holding a harp upon his knees, a thing not at all appropriate for <prn id='Q44233'>Hesiod</prn> to carry, for his own verses make it clear that he sang holding a laurel wand. As to the age of <prn id='Q44233'>Hesiod</prn> and <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>, I have conducted very careful researches into this matter, but I do not like to write on the subject, as I know the quarrelsome nature of those especially who constitute the modern school of epic criticism. </p>
<p id='9.30.4'><b>9.30.4</b> By the side of <prn id='Q174353'>Orpheus</prn> the Thracian stands a statue of <prn id='Q3565120'>Telete</prn>, and around him are beasts of stone and bronze listening to his singing. There are many untruths believed by the Greeks, one of which is that <prn id='Q174353'>Orpheus</prn> was a son of the <prn id='Q66016'>Muse</prn> <prn id='Q103975'>Calliope</prn>, and not of the daughter of <prn id='Q21567935'>Pierus</prn>, that the beasts followed him fascinated by his songs, and that he went down alive to <pl id='Q1521549'>Hades</pl> to ask for his wife from the gods below. In my opinion <prn id='Q174353'>Orpheus</prn> excelled his predecessors in the beauty of his verse, and reached a high degree of power because he was believed to have discovered mysteries, purification from sins, cures of diseases and means of averting divine wrath. </p>
<p id='9.30.5'><b>9.30.5</b> But they say that the women of the <pl id='Q41741'>Thracians</pl> plotted his death, because he had persuaded their husbands to accompany him in his wanderings, but dared not carry out their intention through fear of their husbands. Flushed with wine, however, they dared the deed, and hereafter the custom of their men has been to march to battle drunk. Some say that <prn id='Q174353'>Orpheus</prn> came to his end by being struck by a thunderbolt, hurled at him by the god because he revealed sayings in the mysteries to men who had not heard them before. </p>
<p id='9.30.6'><b>9.30.6</b> Others have said that his wife died before him, and that for her sake he came to Aornum in <pl id='Q2551754'>Thesprotis</pl>, where of old was a <pl id='Q12881666'>Nekyomanteion</pl> (oracle of the dead). He thought, they say, that the soul of <prn id='Q208588'>Eurydice</prn> followed him, but turning round he lost her, and committed suicide for grief. The <pl id='Q41741'>Thracians</pl> say that such nightingales as nest on the grave of <prn id='Q174353'>Orpheus</prn> sing more sweetly and louder than others. </p>
<p id='9.30.7'><b>9.30.7</b> The <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> who dwell in the district below Mount <pl id='Q7800388'>Pieria</pl> and the city of <pl id='Q9207638'>Dium</pl> say that it was here that <prn id='Q174353'>Orpheus</prn> met his end at the hands of the women. Going from <pl id='Q9207638'>Dium</pl> along the road to the mountain, and advancing twenty stades, you come to a pillar on the right surmounted by a stone urn, which according to the natives contains the bones of <prn id='Q174353'>Orpheus</prn>. </p>
<p id='9.30.8'><b>9.30.8</b> There is also a river called HeliconYY. After a course of seventy-five stades the stream hereupon disappears under the earth. After a gap of about twenty-two stades the water rises again, and under the name of Baphyra instead of HeliconYY flows into the sea as a navigable river. The people of <pl id='Q9207638'>Dium</pl> say that at first this river flowed on land throughout its course. But, they go on to say, the women who killed <prn id='Q174353'>Orpheus</prn> wished to wash off in it the blood-stains, and thereat the river sank underground, so as not to lend its waters to cleanse manslaughter. </p>
<p id='9.30.9'><b>9.30.9</b> In <pl id='Q178405'>Larisa</pl> I heard another story, how that on <pl id='Q80344'>Olympus</pl> is a city <pl id='Q1753318'>Libethra</pl>, where the mountain faces, <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl>, not far from which city is the tomb of <prn id='Q174353'>Orpheus</prn>. The <pl id='Q1753318'>Libethrians</pl>, it is said, received out of <pl id='Q41741'>Thrace</pl> an <pl id='Q1943549'>oracle</pl> from <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>, stating that when the sun should see the bones of <prn id='Q174353'>Orpheus</prn>, then the city of <pl id='Q1753318'>Libethra</pl> would be destroyed by a <prn id='Q58697'>boar</prn>. The citizens paid little regard to the oracle, thinking that no other beast was big or mighty enough to take their city, while a <prn id='Q58697'>boar</prn> was bold rather than powerful. </p>
<p id='9.30.10'><b>9.30.10</b> But when it seemed good to the god the following events befell the citizens. About midday a shepherd was asleep leaning against the grave of <prn id='Q174353'>Orpheus</prn>, and even as he slept he began to sing poetry of <prn id='Q174353'>Orpheus</prn> in a loud and sweet voice. Those who were pasturing or tilling nearest to him left their several tasks and gathered together to hear the shepherd sing in his sleep. And jostling one another and striving who could get nearest the shepherd they overturned the pillar, the urn fell from it and broke, and the sun saw whatever was left of the bones of <prn id='Q174353'>Orpheus</prn>. </p>
<p id='9.30.11'><b>9.30.11</b> Immediately when night came the god sent heavy rain, and the river Sys (Boar), one of the torrents about <pl id='Q80344'>Olympus</pl>, on this occasion threw down the walls of <pl id='Q1753318'>Libethra</pl>, overturning sanctuaries of gods and houses of men, and drowning the inhabitants and all the animals in the city. When <pl id='Q1753318'>Libethra</pl> was now a city of ruin, the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> in <pl id='Q9207638'>Dium</pl>, according to my friend of <pl id='Q178405'>Larisa</pl>, carried the bones of <prn id='Q174353'>Orpheus</prn> to their own country. </p>
<p id='9.30.12'><b>9.30.12</b> Whoever has devoted himself to the study of poetry knows that the hymns of <prn id='Q174353'>Orpheus</prn> are all very short, and that the total number of them is not great. The <prn id='Q31789671'>Lycomidae</prn> know them and chant them over the ritual of the mysteries. For poetic beauty they may be said to come next to the hymns of <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>, while they have been even more honored by the gods. </p>
<p id='9.31.1'><b>9.31.1</b> On <pl id='Q215516'>Helicon</pl> there is also a statue of <prn id='Q40234'>Arsinoe</prn>, who married <prn id='Q39576'>Ptolemy</prn> her brother. She is being carried by a bronze ostrich. Ostriches grow wings just like other birds, but their bodies are so heavy and large that the wings cannot lift them into the air. </p>
<p id='9.31.2'><b>9.31.2</b> Here too is <prn id='Q916442'>Telephus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, represented as a baby being suckled by a deer. By his side is an <prn id='Q473194'>ox</prn>, and an image of <prn id='Q206878'>Priapus</prn> worth seeing. This god is worshipped where <prn id='Q2934'>goats</prn> and <prn id='Q7368'>sheep</prn> pasture or there are swarms of <prn id='Q102857'>bees</prn>; but by the people of <pl id='Q1229422'>Lampsacus</pl> he is more revered than any other god, being called by them a son of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> and <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>. </p>
<p id='9.31.3'><b>9.31.3</b> On <pl id='Q215516'>Helicon</pl> tripods have been dedicated, of which the oldest is the one which it is said <prn id='Q44233'>Hesiod</prn> received for winning the prize for song at <pl id='Q21235810'>Chalcis</pl> on the <pl id='Q1137741'>Euripus</pl>. Men too live round about the grove, and here the <pl id='Q1141295'>Thespians</pl> celebrate a festival, and also games called the <pl id='Q7912361'>Museia</pl>. They celebrate other games in honor of <prn id='Q121973'>Eros</prn>, offering prizes not only for music but also for athletic events. Ascending about twenty stades from this grove is what is called the <prn id='Q726'>Horse</prn>'s Fountain (<pl id='Q195848'>Hippocrene</pl>). It was made, they say, by the <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn> of <prn id='Q189872'>Bellerophon</prn> striking the ground with his hoof. </p>
<p id='9.31.4'><b>9.31.4</b> The <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotians</pl> dwelling around <pl id='Q215516'>Helicon</pl> hold the tradition that <prn id='Q44233'>Hesiod</prn> wrote nothing but the <prn id='Q667285'>Works and Days</prn>, and even of this they reject the prelude to the <prn id='Q66016'>Muses</prn>, saying that the poem begins with the account of the <prn id='Q140001'>Strifes</prn>. They showed me also a tablet of lead where the spring is, mostly defaced by time, on which is engraved the Works. </p>
<p id='9.31.5'><b>9.31.5</b> There is another tradition, very different from the first, that <prn id='Q44233'>Hesiod</prn> wrote a great number of poems; the one on women, the one called the <prn id='Q1233074'>Great Eoeae</prn>, the <prn id='Q156498'>Theogony</prn>, the poem on the seer <prn id='Q602258'>Melampus</prn>, the one on the descent to <pl id='Q1521549'>Hades</pl> of <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> and <prn id='Q502156'>Perithous</prn>, the Precepts of <prn id='Q183417'>Chiron</prn>, professing to be for the instruction of <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn>, and other poems besides the <prn id='Q667285'>Works and Days</prn>. These same <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotians</pl> say that <prn id='Q44233'>Hesiod</prn> learnt seercraft from the <pl id='Q416070'>Acarnanians</pl>, and there are extant a poem called <prn id='Q10334603'>Mantica</prn> (Seercraft), which I myself have read, and interpretations of portents. </p>
<p id='9.31.6'><b>9.31.6</b> Opposite stories are also told of <prn id='Q44233'>Hesiod</prn>'s death. All agree that <prn id='Q106593206'>Ctimenus</prn> and <prn id='Q22696413'>Antiphus</prn>, the sons of <prn id='Q22696406'>Ganyctor</prn>, fled from <pl id='Q782278'>Naupactus</pl> to <pl id='Q56401707'>Molycria</pl> because of the murder of <prn id='Q44233'>Hesiod</prn>, that here they sinned against <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, and that in <pl id='Q56401707'>Molycria</pl> their punishment was inflicted. The sister of the young men had been ravished; some say the deed was <prn id='Q44233'>Hesiod</prn>'s, and others that <prn id='Q44233'>Hesiod</prn> was wrongly thought guilty of another's crime. So widely different are the traditions of <prn id='Q44233'>Hesiod</prn> himself and his poems. </p>
<p id='9.31.7'><b>9.31.7</b> On the summit of <pl id='Q215516'>Helicon</pl> is a small river called the Lamus. In the territory of the <pl id='Q1141295'>Thespians</pl> is a place called <pl id='Q106559913'>Donacon</pl> (Reed-bed). Here is the spring of <prn id='Q179256'>Narcissus</prn>. They say that <prn id='Q179256'>Narcissus</prn> looked into this water, and not understanding that he saw his own reflection, unconsciously fell in love with himself, and died of love at the spring. But it is utter stupidity to imagine that a man old enough to fall in love was incapable of distinguishing a man from a man's reflection. </p>
<p id='9.31.8'><b>9.31.8</b> There is another story about <prn id='Q179256'>Narcissus</prn>, less popular indeed than the other, but not without some support. It is said that <prn id='Q179256'>Narcissus</prn> had a twin sister; they were exactly alike in appearance, their hair was the same, they wore similar clothes, and went hunting together. The story goes on that <prn id='Q179256'>Narcissus</prn> fell in love with his sister, and when the girl died, would go to the spring, knowing that it was his reflection that he saw, but in spite of this knowledge finding some relief for his love in imagining that he saw, not his own reflection, but the likeness of his sister. </p>
<p id='9.31.9'><b>9.31.9</b> The flower narcissus grew, in my opinion, before this, if we are to judge by the verses of <prn id='Q11939948'>Pamphos</prn>. This poet was born many years before <prn id='Q179256'>Narcissus</prn> the <pl id='Q1141295'>Thespian</pl>, and he says that <prn id='Q45967'>Kore</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>, was carried off when she was playing and gathering flowers, and that the flowers by which she was deceived into being carried off were not violets, but the narcissus. </p>
<p id='9.32.1'><b>9.32.1</b> <pl id='Q16553547'>Creusis</pl>, the harbor of <pl id='Q1141295'>Thespiae</pl>, has nothing to show publicly, but at the home of a private person I found an image of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> made of gypsum and adorned with painting. The voyage from the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl> to <pl id='Q16553547'>Creusis</pl> is winding and, besides, not a calm one. For capes jut out so that a straight sea-crossing is impossible, and at the same time violent gales blow down from the mountains. </p>
<p id='9.32.2'><b>9.32.2</b> Sailing from <pl id='Q16553547'>Creusis</pl>, not out to sea, but along <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl>, you reach on the right a city called <pl id='Q57374186'>Thisbe</pl>. First there is a mountain by the sea; on crossing it you will come to a plain, and after that to another mountain, at the foot of which is the city. Here there is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> with a standing image of stone, and they hold a festival called the Heracleia. </p>
<p id='9.32.3'><b>9.32.3</b> Nothing would prevent the plain between the mountains becoming a lake owing to the volume of the water, had they not made a strong dyke right through it. So every other year they divert the water to the farther side of the dyke, and farm the other side. <prn id='Q105227168'>Thisbe</prn>, they say, was a nymph of the country, from whom the <pl id='Q57374186'>city</pl> has received its name. </p>
<p id='9.32.4'><b>9.32.4</b> Sailing from here you come to <pl id='Q3561270'>Tipha</pl>, a small town by the sea. The townsfolk have a sanctuary of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> and hold an annual festival. They claim to have been from of old the best sailors in <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl>, and remind you that <prn id='Q654257'>Tiphys</prn>, who was chosen to steer the <prn id='Q317932'>Argo</prn>, was a fellow-townsman. They point out also the place before the city where they say <prn id='Q317932'>Argo</prn> anchored on her return from <pl id='Q183150'>Colchis</pl>. </p>
<p id='9.32.5'><b>9.32.5</b> As you go inland from <pl id='Q1141295'>Thespiae</pl> you come to <pl id='Q359627'>Haliartus</pl>. The question who became founder of <pl id='Q359627'>Haliartus</pl> and <pl id='Q593295'>Coroneia</pl> I cannot separate from my account of <pl id='Q1855083'>Orchomenus</pl>. At the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl> invasion the people of <pl id='Q359627'>Haliartus</pl> sided with the Greeks, and so a division of the army of <prn id='Q129165'>Xerxes</prn> overran and burnt both their territory and their city. In <pl id='Q359627'>Haliartus</pl> is the tomb of <prn id='Q143559'>Lysander</prn> the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonian</pl>. For having attacked the walls of <pl id='Q359627'>Haliartus</pl>, in which were troops from <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> and <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, he fell in the fighting that followed a sortie of the enemy. </p>
<p id='9.32.6'><b>9.32.6</b> <prn id='Q143559'>Lysander</prn> in some ways is worthy of the greatest praise, in others of the sharpest blame. He certainly showed cleverness in the following ways. When in command of the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesian</pl> triremes he waited till <prn id='Q187982'>Alcibiades</prn> was away from the fleet, and then led on <prn id='Q3618730'>Antiochus</prn>, the pilot of <prn id='Q187982'>Alcibiades</prn>, to believe that he was a match for the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> at sea, and when in the rashness of vainglory he put out to sea, <prn id='Q143559'>Lysander</prn> overcame him not far from the city of <pl id='Q1142488'>Colophon</pl>. </p>
<p id='9.32.7'><b>9.32.7</b> And when for the second time he arrived from <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> to take charge of the triremes, he so tamed <prn id='Q8423'>Cyrus</prn> that, whenever he asked for money to pay the fleet, he received it in good time and without stint. When the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> fleet of one hundred ships anchored at <pl id='Q404513'>Aegospotami</pl>, waiting until the sailors were scattered to get water and provisions, he thus captured their vessels. He showed the following example of justice. </p>
<p id='9.32.8'><b>9.32.8</b> <prn id='Q787080'>Autolycus</prn> the pancratiast, whose statue I saw in the <pl id='Q20616418'>Prytaneium</pl> of the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, had a dispute about some piece of property with <prn id='Q15078598'>Eteonicus</prn> of <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>. When <prn id='Q15078598'>Eteonicus</prn> was convicted of making unjust statements, as the rule of the <prn id='Q643488'>Thirty</prn> was then supreme at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, and <prn id='Q143559'>Lysander</prn> had not yet departed, <prn id='Q15078598'>Eteonicus</prn> was encouraged to make an unprovoked assault, and when <prn id='Q787080'>Autolycus</prn> resisted, summoned him before <prn id='Q143559'>Lysander</prn>, confidently expecting that judgment would be given in his favour. But <prn id='Q143559'>Lysander</prn> gave judgment against <prn id='Q15078598'>Eteonicus</prn> and dismissed him with a reprimand. </p>
<p id='9.32.9'><b>9.32.9</b> All this redounds to the credit of <prn id='Q143559'>Lysander</prn>, but the following incidents are a reproach. <prn id='Q2088105'>Philocles</prn>, the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> commander-in-chief at <pl id='Q404513'>Aegospotami</pl>, along with four thousand other <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> prisoners, were put to death by <prn id='Q143559'>Lysander</prn>, who even refused them burial afterwards, a thing which even the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl> who landed at <pl id='Q31900'>Marathon</pl> received from the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, and the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> themselves who fell at <pl id='Q194450'>Thermopylae</pl> received from King <prn id='Q129165'>Xerxes</prn>. <prn id='Q143559'>Lysander</prn> brought a yet deeper disgrace upon the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> by the Commissions of Ten he set over the cities and by the <pl id='Q11931074'>Laconian</pl> governors. </p>
<p id='9.32.10'><b>9.32.10</b> Again, an oracle had warned the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> that only love of money could destroy <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>, and so they were not used to acquiring wealth, yet <prn id='Q143559'>Lysander</prn> aroused in the <pl id='Q5690'>Spartans</pl> a strong desire for riches. I for my part follow the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl>, and judge by the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl> law, and decide that <prn id='Q143559'>Lysander</prn> brought on the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> more harm than benefit. </p>
<p id='9.33.1'><b>9.33.1</b> In <pl id='Q359627'>Haliartus</pl> too there is the tomb of <prn id='Q143559'>Lysander</prn> and a hero-shrine of <prn id='Q974346'>Cecrops</prn> the son of <prn id='Q865111'>Pandion</prn>. Mount <pl id='Q15696676'>Tilphusius</pl> and the spring called <pl id='Q106518113'>Tilphusa</pl> are about fifty stades away from <pl id='Q359627'>Haliartus</pl>. The Greeks declare that the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>, along with the sons of <prn id='Q334817'>Polyneices</prn>, after capturing <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>, were bringing <prn id='Q656881'>Teiresias</prn> and some other of the spoil to the god at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>, when <prn id='Q656881'>Teiresias</prn>, being thirsty, drank by the wayside of the <pl id='Q106518113'>Tilphusa</pl>, and forthwith gave up the ghost; his grave is by the spring. </p>
<p id='9.33.2'><b>9.33.2</b> They say that the daughter of <prn id='Q656881'>Teiresias</prn> was given to <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> by the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl>, and at the command of the god crossed with ships to the <pl id='Q1142488'>Colophonian</pl> land in what is now called <pl id='Q620874'>Ionia</pl>. <prn id='Q1332949'>Manto</prn> there married <prn id='Q2446699'>Rhacius</prn>, a <pl id='Q4752820'>Cretan</pl>. The rest of the history of <prn id='Q656881'>Teiresias</prn> is known to all as a tradition: the number of years it is recorded that he lived, how he changed from a woman to a man, and that <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> in the <prn id='Q35160'>Odyssey</prn> represents <prn id='Q656881'>Teiresias</prn> as the only one in <pl id='Q1521549'>Hades</pl> endowed with intelligence. </p>
<p id='9.33.3'><b>9.33.3</b> At <pl id='Q359627'>Haliartus</pl> there is in the open a sanctuary of the goddesses they call PraxidicaYY (those who exact punishments). Here they swear, but they do not make the oath rashly. The sanctuary of the goddesses is near Mount <pl id='Q15696676'>Tilphusius</pl>. In <pl id='Q359627'>Haliartus</pl> are temples, with no images inside, and without roofs. I could not discover either to whom these temples were built. </p>
<p id='9.33.4'><b>9.33.4</b> In the land of <pl id='Q359627'>Haliartus</pl> there is a river <prn id='Q6676329'>Lophis</prn>. It is said that the land was originally arid and without water, so that one of the rulers came to <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> and asked in what way they would find water in the land. The <prn id='Q220344'>Pythian priestess</prn>, they say, commanded him to kill the man who should first meet him on his return to <pl id='Q359627'>Haliartus</pl>. On his arrival he was met by his son <prn id='Q6676329'>Lophis</prn>, and at once smote the youth with his sword. Still living, the lad ran about, and where the blood ran water rose up from the earth. Wherefore the river is called <prn id='Q6676329'>Lophis</prn>. </p>
<p id='9.33.5'><b>9.33.5</b> <pl id='Q1044061'>Alalcomenae</pl> is a small village, and it lies at the very foot of a mountain of no great height. Its name, some say, is derived from Alalcomeneus, an aboriginal, by whom <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> was brought up; others declare that <prn id='Q390789'>Alalcomenia</prn> was one of the daughters of <prn id='Q1142802'>Ogygus</prn>. At some distance from the village on the level ground has been made a temple of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> with an ancient image of ivory. </p>
<p id='9.33.6'><b>9.33.6</b> <prn id='Q483783'>Sulla</prn>'s treatment of the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> was savage and foreign to the Roman character, but quite consistent with his treatment of <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> and <pl id='Q1855083'>Orchomenus</pl>. But in <pl id='Q1044061'>Alalcomenae</pl> he added yet another to his crimes by stealing the image of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> itself. After these mad outrages against the Greek cities and the gods of the Greeks he was attacked by the most foul of diseases. He broke out into lice, and what was formerly accounted his good fortune came to such an end. The sanctuary at <pl id='Q1044061'>Alalcomenae</pl>, deprived of the goddess, was hereafter neglected. </p>
<p id='9.33.7'><b>9.33.7</b> In my time yet another incident added to the ruin of the temple. A large and strong ivy-tree grew over it, loosening the stones from their joints and tearing them apart. Here too there flows a river, a small torrent. They call it A2039, because the story is that beside a river A2039 <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> was reared, the implication being that the A2039 was this and not the river in <pl id='Q2370577'>Libya</pl>, which flows into the Libyan sea out of lake Tritonis. </p>
<p id='9.34.1'><b>9.34.1</b> Before reaching <pl id='Q593295'>Coroneia</pl> from <pl id='Q1044061'>Alalcomenae</pl> we come to the <pl id='Q13574897'>sanctuary of Itonian</pl> <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>. It is named after Itonius the son of <prn id='Q474854'>Amphictyon</prn>, and here the <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotians</pl> gather for their general assembly. In the temple are bronze images of Itonian <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> and <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>; the artist was <prn id='Q395404'>Agoracritus</prn>, pupil and loved one of <prn id='Q177302'>Pheidias</prn>. In my time they dedicated too images of the <prn id='Q184353'>Graces</prn>. </p>
<p id='9.34.2'><b>9.34.2</b> The following tale, too, is told. <prn id='Q4202635'>Iodama</prn>, who served the goddess as priestess, entered the precinct by night, where there appeared to her <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, upon whose tunic was worked the head of <prn id='Q160730'>Medusa</prn> the <prn id='Q160730'>Gorgon</prn>. When <prn id='Q4202635'>Iodama</prn> saw it, she was turned to stone. For this reason a woman puts fire every day on the altar of <prn id='Q4202635'>Iodama</prn>, and as she does this she thrice repeats in the <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotian</pl> dialect that <prn id='Q4202635'>Iodama</prn> is living and asking for fire. </p>
<p id='9.34.3'><b>9.34.3</b> On the agora of <pl id='Q593295'>Coroneia</pl> I found two remarkable things, an altar of <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> <prn id='Q60487008'>Epimelius</prn> (Keeper of flocks) and an altar of the winds. A little lower down is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> with an ancient image, the work of <prn id='Q3298190'>Pythodorus</prn> of <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>; in her hand she carries <prn id='Q150986'>Sirens</prn>. For the story goes that the daughters of <prn id='Q391379'>Achelous</prn> were persuaded by <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> to compete with the <prn id='Q66016'>Muses</prn> in singing. The <prn id='Q66016'>Muses</prn> won, plucked out the <prn id='Q150986'>Sirens</prn>' feathers (so they say) and made crowns for themselves out of them. </p>
<p id='9.34.4'><b>9.34.4</b> Some forty stades from <pl id='Q593295'>Coroneia</pl> is Mount <pl id='Q106298445'>Libethrion</pl>, on which are <pl id='Q38280115'>images</pl> of the <prn id='Q66016'>Muses</prn> and <prn id='Q373916'>Nymphs</prn> surnamed <pl id='Q106298445'>Libethrian</pl>. There are springs too, one named Libethrias and the other Rock (Petra), which are shaped like a woman's breasts, and from them rises water like milk. </p>
<p id='9.34.5'><b>9.34.5</b> The distance from <pl id='Q593295'>Coroneia</pl> to Mount <pl id='Q24888313'>Laphystius</pl> and the precinct of <prn id='Q107349743'>Laphystian</prn> <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> is about twenty stades. The image is of stone. They say that when <prn id='Q143880'>Athamas</prn> was about to sacrifice here <prn id='Q743482'>Phrixus</prn> and <prn id='Q638578'>Helle</prn>, a ram with his fleece of gold was sent by <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> to the children, and that on the back of this ram they made good their escape. Higher up is a <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> surnamed A2164 (with bright eyes). Here, say the <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotians</pl>, <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> ascended with the <prn id='Q83496'>hound of Hades</prn>. On the way down from Mount <pl id='Q24888313'>Laphystius</pl> to the <pl id='Q13574897'>place of Itonian</pl> <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> is the river Phalaros, which runs into the <pl id='Q1235405'>Cephisian</pl> lake. </p>
<p id='9.34.6'><b>9.34.6</b> Beyond Mount <pl id='Q24888313'>Laphystius</pl> is <pl id='Q543895'>Orchomenus</pl>, as famous a city as any in Greece. Once raised to the greatest heights of prosperity, it too was fated to fall almost as low as <pl id='Q132564'>Mycenae</pl> and <pl id='Q173148'>Delos</pl>. Its ancient history is confined to the following traditions. They say that <prn id='Q503500'>Andreus</prn>, son of the river <pl id='Q1233866'>Peneius</pl>, was the first to settle here, and after him the land AndreisYY was named. </p>
<p id='9.34.7'><b>9.34.7</b> When <prn id='Q143880'>Athamas</prn> joined him, he assigned to him, of his own land, the territory round Mount <pl id='Q24888313'>Laphystius</pl> with what are now the territories of <pl id='Q593295'>Coroneia</pl> and <pl id='Q359627'>Haliartus</pl>. <prn id='Q143880'>Athamas</prn>, thinking that none of his male children were left, adopted <prn id='Q3611637'>Haliartus</prn> and <prn id='Q1319159'>Coronus</prn>, the sons of <prn id='Q10380878'>Thersander</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q102561'>Sisyphus</prn>, his brother. For he himself had put to death <prn id='Q1462644'>Learchus</prn> and <prn id='Q738007'>Melicertes</prn>; <prn id='Q3198070'>Leucon</prn> had fallen sick and died; while as for <prn id='Q743482'>Phrixus</prn>, <prn id='Q143880'>Athamas</prn> did not know if he survived or had descendants surviving. </p>
<p id='9.34.8'><b>9.34.8</b> When later <prn id='Q743482'>Phrixus</prn> himself, according to some, or <prn id='Q3910877'>Presbon</prn>, according to others, returned from <pl id='Q183150'>Colchis</pl> — <prn id='Q3910877'>Presbon</prn> was a son of <prn id='Q743482'>Phrixus</prn> by the daughter of <prn id='Q241971'>Aeetes</prn> — the sons of <prn id='Q10380878'>Thersander</prn> agreed that the house of <prn id='Q143880'>Athamas</prn> belonged to <prn id='Q143880'>Athamas</prn> and his descendants, while they themselves became founders of <pl id='Q359627'>Haliartus</pl> and <pl id='Q593295'>Coroneia</pl>, for <prn id='Q143880'>Athamas</prn> gave them a part of his land. </p>
<p id='9.34.9'><b>9.34.9</b> Even before this <prn id='Q503500'>Andreus</prn> took to wife from <prn id='Q143880'>Athamas</prn> <prn id='Q1319998'>Euippe</prn>, daughter of <prn id='Q3198070'>Leucon</prn>, and had a son, <prn id='Q337894'>Eteocles</prn>. According to the report of the citizens, <prn id='Q337894'>Eteocles</prn> was the son of the river <pl id='Q1235405'>Cephisus</pl>, wherefore some of the poets in their verses called him <prn id='Q337894'>Cephisiades</prn>. </p>
<p id='9.34.10'><b>9.34.10</b> When this <prn id='Q337894'>Eteocles</prn> became king, he let the country be still called after <prn id='Q503500'>Andreus</prn>, but he established two tribes, naming one Cephisias, and the other after himself. When <prn id='Q1158901'>Almus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q102561'>Sisyphus</prn>, came to him, he gave him to dwell in a little of the land, and a village was then called Almones after this <prn id='Q1158901'>Almus</prn>. Afterwards the name of the village that was generally adopted was <pl id='Q12872591'>Olmones</pl>. </p>
<p id='9.35.1'><b>9.35.1</b> The <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotians</pl> say that <prn id='Q337894'>Eteocles</prn> was the first man to sacrifice to the <prn id='Q184353'>Graces</prn>. Moreover, they are aware that he established three as the number of the <prn id='Q184353'>Graces</prn>, but they have no tradition of the names he gave them. The <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, however, say that the <prn id='Q184353'>Graces</prn> are two, and that they were instituted by <prn id='Q1065774'>Lacedemon</prn>, son of <prn id='Q112001'>Taygete</prn>, who gave them the names of <prn id='Q12879099'>Cleta</prn> and <prn id='Q11328715'>Phaenna</prn>. </p>
<p id='9.35.2'><b>9.35.2</b> These are appropriate names for <prn id='Q184353'>Graces</prn>, as are those given by the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, who from of old have worshipped two <prn id='Q184353'>Graces</prn>, <prn id='Q789715'>Auxo</prn> and <prn id='Q1232483'>Hegemone</prn>. <prn id='Q676834'>Carpo</prn> is the name, not of a <prn id='Q184353'>Grace</prn>, but of a <prn id='Q201411'>Season</prn> (Hora). The other <prn id='Q201411'>Season</prn> is worshipped together with <prn id='Q633120'>Pandrosus</prn> by the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, who call the goddess <prn id='Q1245211'>Thallo</prn>. </p>
<p id='9.35.3'><b>9.35.3</b> It was from <prn id='Q337894'>Eteocles</prn> of <pl id='Q1855083'>Orchomenus</pl> that we learned the custom of praying to three <prn id='Q184353'>Graces</prn>. And <prn id='Q3616838'>Angelion</prn> and <prn id='Q11951091'>Tectaeus</prn>, sons of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>, who made the image of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> for the <pl id='Q173148'>Delians</pl>, set three <prn id='Q184353'>Graces</prn> in his hand. Again, at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, before the entrance to the <pl id='Q131013'>Acropolis</pl>, the <prn id='Q184353'>Graces</prn> are three in number; by their side are celebrated mysteries which must not be divulged to the many. </p>
<p id='9.35.4'><b>9.35.4</b> <prn id='Q11939948'>Pamphos</prn> was the first we know of to sing about the <prn id='Q184353'>Graces</prn>, but his poetry contains no information either as to their number or about their names. <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> (he too refers to the <prn id='Q184353'>Graces</prn>) makes one the wife of <prn id='Q44384'>Hephaestus</prn>, giving her the name of <prn id='Q184353'>Grace</prn>. He also says that <prn id='Q189347'>Sleep</prn> was a lover of <prn id='Q1235379'>Pasithea</prn>, and in the speech of <prn id='Q189347'>Sleep</prn> there is this verse: “Verily that he would give me one of the younger <prn id='Q184353'>Graces</prn>.” Hence some have suspected that <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> knew of older <prn id='Q184353'>Graces</prn> as well. </p>
<p id='9.35.5'><b>9.35.5</b> <prn id='Q44233'>Hesiod</prn> in the <prn id='Q156498'>Theogony</prn> (though the authorship is doubtful, this poem is good evidence) says that the <prn id='Q184353'>Graces</prn> are daughters of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> and <prn id='Q548099'>Eurynome</prn>, giving them the names of <prn id='Q689422'>Euphrosyne</prn>, <prn id='Q4439972'>Aglaia</prn> and <prn id='Q1260484'>Thalia</prn>. The poem of <prn id='Q537647'>Onomacritus</prn> agrees with this account. <prn id='Q577769'>Antimachus</prn>, while giving neither the number of the <prn id='Q184353'>Graces</prn> nor their names, says that they are daughters of <prn id='Q21272183'>Aegle</prn> and the <prn id='Q134270'>Sun</prn>. The elegiac poet <prn id='Q1613558'>Hermesianax</prn> disagrees with his predecessors in that he makes <prn id='Q611171'>Persuasion</prn> also one of the <prn id='Q184353'>Graces</prn>. </p>
<p id='9.35.6'><b>9.35.6</b> Who it was who first represented the <prn id='Q184353'>Graces</prn> naked, whether in sculpture or in painting, I could not discover. During the earlier period, certainly, sculptors and painters alike represented them draped. At <pl id='Q1379299'>Smyrna</pl>, for instance, in the sanctuary of the Nemeses, above the cult statues have been dedicated <prn id='Q184353'>Graces</prn> of gold, the work of <prn id='Q852011'>Bupalus</prn>; and in the Odeion in the same city there is a portrait of a <prn id='Q184353'>Grace</prn>, painted by <prn id='Q216822'>Apelles</prn>. At <pl id='Q18986'>Pergamus</pl> likewise, in the chamber of <prn id='Q110745'>Attalus</prn>, are other images of <prn id='Q184353'>Graces</prn> made by <prn id='Q852011'>Bupalus</prn>; </p>
<p id='9.35.7'><b>9.35.7</b> and near what is called the Pythion there is a portrait of <prn id='Q184353'>Graces</prn>, painted by PythagoraYY the <pl id='Q65040323'>Parian</pl>. <prn id='Q913'>Socrates</prn> too, son of <prn id='Q2303035'>Sophroniscus</prn>, made images of <prn id='Q184353'>Graces</prn> for the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, which are before the entrance to the <pl id='Q131013'>Acropolis</pl>. All these are alike draped; but later artists, I do not know the reason, have changed the way of portraying them. Certainly today sculptors and painters represent <prn id='Q184353'>Graces</prn> naked. </p>
<p id='9.36.1'><b>9.36.1</b> When <prn id='Q337894'>Eteocles</prn> died the kingdom devolved on the family of <prn id='Q1158901'>Almus</prn>. <prn id='Q1158901'>Almus</prn> himself had daughters born to him, <prn id='Q1088827'>Chrysogeneia</prn> and <prn id='Q138151'>Chryse</prn>. Tradition has it that <prn id='Q138151'>Chryse</prn>, daughter of <prn id='Q1158901'>Almus</prn>, had by <prn id='Q40901'>Ares</prn> a son <prn id='Q831583'>Phlegyas</prn>, who, as <prn id='Q337894'>Eteocles</prn> died childless, got the throne. To the whole country they gave the name of Phlegyantis instead of AndreisYY, </p>
<p id='9.36.2'><b>9.36.2</b> and besides the originally founded city of AndreisYY, <prn id='Q831583'>Phlegyas</prn> founded another, which he named after himself, collecting into it the best soldiers in Greece. In course of time the foolhardy and reckless <prn id='Q18629873'>Phlegyans</prn> seceded from <pl id='Q1855083'>Orchomenus</pl> and began to ravage their neighbors. At last they even marched against the sanctuary at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> to raid it, when <prn id='Q53606'>Philammon</prn> with picked men of <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> went out to meet them, but he and his picked men perished in the engagement. </p>
<p id='9.36.3'><b>9.36.3</b> That the <prn id='Q18629873'>Phlegyans</prn> took more pleasure in war than any other Greeks is also shown by the lines of the <prn id='Q8275'>Iliad</prn> dealing with <prn id='Q40901'>Ares</prn> and his son <prn id='Q105019'>Phobos</prn>: “They twain were arming themselves for war to go to the Ephyrians, Or to the great-hearted <prn id='Q18629873'>Phlegyans</prn>.” By <pl id='Q1346887'>Ephyrians</pl> in this passage <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> means, I think, those in <pl id='Q2551754'>Thesprotis</pl>. The <prn id='Q18629873'>Phlegyan</prn> race was completely overthrown by the god with continual thunderbolts and violent earthquakes. The remnant were wasted by an epidemic of plague, but a few of them escaped to <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl>. </p>
<p id='9.36.4'><b>9.36.4</b> <prn id='Q831583'>Phlegyas</prn> had no sons, and <prn id='Q57426646'>Chryses</prn> succeeded to the throne, a son of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> by <prn id='Q1088827'>Chrysogeneia</prn>, daughter of <prn id='Q1158901'>Almus</prn>. This <prn id='Q57426646'>Chryses</prn> had a son called <prn id='Q1466343'>Minyas</prn>, and after him the people over whom he ruled are still called <prn id='Q1065225'>Minyans</prn>. The revenues that <prn id='Q1466343'>Minyas</prn> received were so great that he surpassed his predecessors in wealth, and he was the first man we know of to build a <pl id='Q1792894'>treasury</pl> to receive his riches. </p>
<p id='9.36.5'><b>9.36.5</b> The Greeks appear apt to regard with greater wonder foreign sights than sights at home. For whereas distinguished historians have described the <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptian</pl> pyramids with the minutest detail, they have not made even the briefest mention of the <pl id='Q1792894'>treasury</pl> of <prn id='Q6871244'>Minyas</prn> and the walls of <pl id='Q217379'>Tiryns</pl>, though these are no less marvellous. </p>
<p id='9.36.6'><b>9.36.6</b> <prn id='Q6871244'>Minyas</prn> had a son <prn id='Q4337246'>Orchomenus</prn>, in whose reign the city was called <pl id='Q543895'>Orchomenus</pl> and the men <pl id='Q543895'>Orchomenians</pl>. Nevertheless, they continued to bear the additional name of <prn id='Q1065225'>Minyans</prn>, to distinguish them from the <pl id='Q1855083'>Orchomenians</pl> in <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl>. To this <pl id='Q543895'>Orchomenus</pl> during his kingship came <prn id='Q5955770'>Hyettus</prn> from <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>, who was an exile because of the slaying of <prn id='Q6896910'>Molurus</prn>, son of ArisbasYY, whom he caught with his wedded wife and killed. <pl id='Q543895'>Orchomenus</pl> assigned to him such of the land as is now around the village <pl id='Q12872650'>Hyettus</pl>, and the land adjacent to this. </p>
<p id='9.36.7'><b>9.36.7</b> <prn id='Q5955770'>Hyettus</prn> is also mentioned by the poet who composed the poem called by the Greeks the Great <prn id='Q1233074'>Eoeae</prn>: “And <prn id='Q5955770'>Hyettus</prn> killed <prn id='Q6896910'>Molurus</prn>, the dear son of ArisbasYY, <br>In the halls, because of his wife's bed; <br>Leaving his home he fled from horse-breeding <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>, <br>And reached <prn id='Q1065225'>Minyan</prn> <pl id='Q543895'>Orchomenus</pl>, and the hero <br>Welcomed him, and bestowed on him a portion of his possessions, as was fitting.” </p>
<p id='9.36.8'><b>9.36.8</b> This <prn id='Q5955770'>Hyettus</prn> was the first man known to have exacted punishment from an adulterer. Later on, when <prn id='Q28626'>Dracon</prn> was legislator for the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, it was enacted in the laws which he drew up for the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> that the punishment of an adulterer should be one of the acts condoned by the State. So high did the reputation of the <prn id='Q1065225'>Minyans</prn> stand, that even <prn id='Q637955'>Neleus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q869665'>Cretheus</prn>, who was king of <pl id='Q2047396'>Pylus</pl>, took a wife from <pl id='Q543895'>Orchomenus</pl>, namely <prn id='Q28122362'>Chloris</prn>, daughter of <prn id='Q474917'>Amphion</prn>, son of <prn id='Q1404904'>Iasius</prn>. </p>
<p id='9.37.1'><b>9.37.1</b> But it was destined for the race of <prn id='Q1158901'>Almus</prn> too to come to an end. For <prn id='Q4337246'>Orchomenus</prn> left no child, and so the kingdom devolved on <prn id='Q2980443'>Clymenus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q3910877'>Presbon</prn>, son of <prn id='Q743482'>Phrixus</prn>. Sons were born to <prn id='Q2980443'>Clymenus</prn>; the eldest was <prn id='Q1294873'>Erginus</prn>, the next after him were <prn id='Q14195804'>Stratius</prn>, <prn id='Q14183768'>Arrhon</prn> and <prn id='Q14324181'>Pyleus</prn>, while the youngest was <prn id='Q12873065'>Azeus</prn>. <prn id='Q2980443'>Clymenus</prn> was murdered at the feast of Onchestian <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> by men of <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>, whom a trivial cause had thrown into a violent passion. So <prn id='Q1294873'>Erginus</prn>, the eldest of the sons of <prn id='Q2980443'>Clymenus</prn>, received the kingdom. </p>
<p id='9.37.2'><b>9.37.2</b> Immediately he and his brothers gathered a force and attacked <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>. Victorious in the battle, they then came to an agreement that the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> should pay tribute each year for the murder of <prn id='Q2980443'>Clymenus</prn>. But when <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> had grown to manhood in <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>, the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> were thus relieved of the tribute, and the <prn id='Q1065225'>Minyans</prn> suffered a grievous defeat in the war. </p>
<p id='9.37.3'><b>9.37.3</b> <prn id='Q1294873'>Erginus</prn>, as his citizens had been utterly crushed, made peace with <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, but in his efforts to restore his former wealth and prosperity neglected everything else, so that unconsciously he came to a wifeless and childless old age. But when he had gathered riches, the desire seized him to have children. </p>
<p id='9.37.4'><b>9.37.4</b> So going to <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> he inquired of the oracle about children, and the <prn id='Q220344'>Pythian priestess</prn> gave this reply: <br>“<prn id='Q1294873'>Erginus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q2980443'>Clymenus</prn> <prn id='Q3910877'>Presboniades</prn>, <br>Late thou camest seeking offspring, but even now <br>To the old plough-tree put a new tip.” <br>Obeying the oracle he took to himself a young wife, and had children, <prn id='Q1166183'>Trophonius</prn> and <prn id='Q390363'>Agamedes</prn>. </p>
<p id='9.37.5'><b>9.37.5</b> <prn id='Q1166183'>Trophonius</prn> is said to have been a son of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, not of <prn id='Q1294873'>Erginus</prn>. This I am inclined to believe, as does everyone who has gone to <prn id='Q1166183'>Trophonius</prn> to inquire of his <pl id='Q12880663'>oracle</pl>. They say that these, when they grew up, proved clever at building sanctuaries for the gods and palaces for men. For they built the <pl id='Q10751359'>temple</pl> for <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> and the treasury for <prn id='Q1817912'>Hyrieus</prn>. One of the stones in it they made so that they could take it away from the outside. So they kept on removing something from the store. <prn id='Q1817912'>Hyrieus</prn> was dumbfounded when he saw keys and seals untampered with, while the treasure kept on getting less. </p>
<p id='9.37.6'><b>9.37.6</b> So he set over the vessels, in which were his silver and gold, snares or other contrivance, to arrest any who should enter and lay hands on the treasure. <prn id='Q390363'>Agamedes</prn> entered and was kept fast in the trap, but <prn id='Q1166183'>Trophonius</prn> cut off his head, lest when day came his brother should be tortured, and he himself be informed of as being concerned in the crime. </p>
<p id='9.37.7'><b>9.37.7</b> The earth opened and swallowed up <prn id='Q1166183'>Trophonius</prn> at the point in the grove at <pl id='Q11931280'>Lebadeia</pl> where is what is called the pit of <prn id='Q390363'>Agamedes</prn>, with a slab beside it. The kingdom of <pl id='Q543895'>Orchomenus</pl> was taken by <prn id='Q660196'>Ascalaphus</prn> and <prn id='Q1655397'>Ialmenus</prn>, said to be sons of <prn id='Q40901'>Ares</prn>, while their mother was <prn id='Q15360381'>Astyoche</prn>, daughter of <prn id='Q2823758'>Actor</prn>, son of <prn id='Q12873065'>Azeus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q2980443'>Clymenus</prn>. Under the leadership of these the <prn id='Q1065225'>Minyans</prn> marched against <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl>. </p>
<p id='9.37.8'><b>9.37.8</b> <pl id='Q543895'>Orchomenians</pl> also joined with the sons of <prn id='Q1052888'>Codrus</prn> in the expedition to <pl id='Q620874'>Ionia</pl>. When expelled from their city by the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> they were restored again to <pl id='Q543895'>Orchomenus</pl> by <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn> the son of <prn id='Q313907'>Amyntas</prn>. But Providence [από του δαιμονίου] was to drag them ever lower and lower into decay. </p>
<p id='9.38.1'><b>9.38.1</b> At <pl id='Q543895'>Orchomenus</pl> is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>, but the oldest is one of the <prn id='Q184353'>Graces</prn>. They worship the stones most, and say that they fell for <prn id='Q506550'>Eteocles</prn> out of heaven. The decorated cult statues were dedicated in my time, and they too are of stone. </p>
<p id='9.38.2'><b>9.38.2</b> They have also a fountain worth seeing, and go down to it to fetch water. The <pl id='Q1792894'>treasury</pl> of <prn id='Q6871244'>Minyas</prn>, a wonder second to none either in Greece itself or elsewhere, has been built in the following way. It is made of stone; its shape is round, rising to a rather blunt apex; they say that the highest stone is the keystone of the whole building. </p>
<p id='9.38.3'><b>9.38.3</b> There are graves of <prn id='Q6871244'>Minyas</prn> and <prn id='Q44233'>Hesiod</prn>. They say that they thus recovered the bones of <prn id='Q44233'>Hesiod</prn>. A pestilence fell on men and beasts, so that they sent envoys to the god. To these, it is said, the <prn id='Q220344'>Pythian priestess</prn> made answer that to bring the bones of <prn id='Q44233'>Hesiod</prn> from the land of <pl id='Q782278'>Naupactus</pl> to the land of <pl id='Q543895'>Orchomenus</pl> was their one and only remedy. Whereupon the envoys asked a further question, where in the land of <pl id='Q782278'>Naupactus</pl> they would find the bones; to which the <prn id='Q220344'>Pythian priestess</prn> answered again that a <prn id='Q43365'>crow</prn> would indicate to them the place. </p>
<p id='9.38.4'><b>9.38.4</b> So when the envoys landed, they saw, it is said, a rock not far from the road, with the bird upon the rock; the bones of <prn id='Q44233'>Hesiod</prn> they found in a cleft of the rock. Elegiac verses are inscribed on the tomb: <br>“<pl id='Q936920'>Ascra</pl> rich in corn was his native land, but when <prn id='Q44233'>Hesiod</prn> died, <br>The land of the horse-striking <prn id='Q1065225'>Minyans</prn> holds his bones, <br>Whose fame will rise very high in Greece <br>When men are judged by the touchstone of artistry. </p>
<p id='9.38.5'><b>9.38.5</b> About <prn id='Q208531'>Actaeon</prn> the <pl id='Q543895'>Orchomenians</pl> had the following story. A ghost, they say, carrying a rock was ravaging the land. When they inquired at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>, the god bade them discover the remains of <prn id='Q208531'>Actaeon</prn> and bury them in the earth. He also bade them make a bronze likeness of the ghost and fasten it to a rock with iron. I have myself seen this image thus fastened. They also sacrifice every year to <prn id='Q208531'>Actaeon</prn> as to a hero. </p>
<p id='9.38.6'><b>9.38.6</b> Seven stades from <pl id='Q543895'>Orchomenus</pl> is a temple of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> with a small image. Here are the <pl id='Q106391783'>springs</pl> of the river <pl id='Q25018061'>Melas</pl> (black), one of the streams running into the <pl id='Q1235405'>Cephisian</pl> Lake. The lake at all times covers the greater part of the <pl id='Q543895'>Orchomenian</pl> territory, but in the winter season, after the south-west wind has generally prevailed, the water spreads over a yet greater extent of the territory. </p>
<p id='9.38.7'><b>9.38.7</b> The <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> declare that the river <pl id='Q1235405'>Cephisus</pl> was diverted into the <pl id='Q543895'>Orchomenian</pl> plain by <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, and that for a time it passed under the mountain and entered the sea, until <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> blocked up the <pl id='Q106514994'>chasm</pl> through the mountain. Now <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> too knows that the <pl id='Q1235405'>Cephisian</pl> Lake was a lake of itself, and not made by <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>. Wherefore <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> says: “Sloping towards the <pl id='Q1235405'>Cephisian</pl> Lake.” [5.709] </p>
<p id='9.38.8'><b>9.38.8</b> It is not likely either that the <pl id='Q543895'>Orchomenians</pl> would not have discovered the chasm, and, breaking down the work put up by <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, have given back to the <pl id='Q1235405'>Cephisus</pl> its ancient passage, since right down to the <prn id='Q42937'>Trojan War</prn> they were a wealthy people. There is evidence in my favour in the passage of <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> where <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn> replies to the envoys from <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn>: “Not even the wealth that comes to <pl id='Q543895'>Orchomenus</pl>,” a line that clearly shows that even then the revenues coming to <pl id='Q543895'>Orchomenus</pl> were large. </p>
<p id='9.38.9'><b>9.38.9</b> They say that <pl id='Q12874125'>Aspledon</pl> was left by the inhabitants because of a shortage of water. They say also that the city got its name from <prn id='Q55804916'>Aspledon</prn>, who was a son of the nymph <prn id='Q16607057'>Mideia</prn> and <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>. Their view is confirmed by some verses composed by <prn id='Q5092559'>Chersias</prn>, a man of <pl id='Q543895'>Orchomenus</pl>: “To <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> and glorious <prn id='Q16607057'>Mideia</prn> was born <prn id='Q55804916'>Aspledon</prn> in the spacious city. </p>
<p id='9.38.10'><b>9.38.10</b> The poem of <prn id='Q5092559'>Chersias</prn> was no longer extant in my day, but these verses are quoted by <prn id='Q11910954'>Callippus</prn> in the same history of <pl id='Q543895'>Orchomenus</pl>. The <pl id='Q1855083'>Orchomenians</pl> have a tradition that this <prn id='Q5092559'>Chersias</prn> wrote also the inscription on the grave of <prn id='Q44233'>Hesiod</prn>. </p>
<p id='9.39.1'><b>9.39.1</b> On the side towards the mountains the boundary of <pl id='Q543895'>Orchomenus</pl> is <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl>, but on the plain it is <pl id='Q11931280'>Lebadeia</pl>. Originally this city stood on high ground, and was called <prn id='Q16607057'>Mideia</prn> after the mother of <pl id='Q12874125'>Aspledon</pl>. But when <prn id='Q106616114'>Lebadus</prn> came to it from <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, the inhabitants went down to the low ground, and the city was named <pl id='Q11931280'>Lebadeia</pl> after him. Who was the father of <prn id='Q106616114'>Lebadus</prn>, and why he came, they do not know; they know only that the wife of <prn id='Q106616114'>Lebadus</prn> was Laonice. </p>
<p id='9.39.2'><b>9.39.2</b> The city is no less adorned than the most prosperous of the Greek cities, and it is separated from the <pl id='Q12880663'>grove</pl> of <prn id='Q1166183'>Trophonius</prn> by the river <pl id='Q106496258'>Hercyna</pl>. They say that here <prn id='Q16737633'>Hercyna</prn>, when playing with <prn id='Q45967'>Kore</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>, held a goose which against her will she let loose. The bird flew into a hollow cave and hid under a stone; <prn id='Q45967'>Kore</prn> entered and took the bird as it lay under the stone. The water flowed, they say, from the place where <prn id='Q45967'>Kore</prn> took up the stone, and hence the river received the name of <pl id='Q106496258'>Hercyna</pl>. </p>
<p id='9.39.3'><b>9.39.3</b> On the bank of the river there is a temple of <prn id='Q16737633'>Hercyna</prn>, in which is a maiden holding a goose in her arms. In the cave are the sources of the river and images standing, and <prn id='Q2102'>serpents</prn> are coiled around their scepters. One might conjecture the images to be of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> and <prn id='Q202257'>Health</prn>, but they might be <prn id='Q1166183'>Trophonius</prn> and <prn id='Q16737633'>Hercyna</prn>, because they think that <prn id='Q2102'>serpents</prn> are just as much sacred to <prn id='Q1166183'>Trophonius</prn> as to <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>. By the side of the river is the tomb of <prn id='Q2860691'>Arcesilaus</prn>, whose bones, they say, were carried back from <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl> by <prn id='Q2194100'>Leitus</prn>. </p>
<p id='9.39.4'><b>9.39.4</b> The most famous things in the grove are a temple and <pl id='Q12880663'>image</pl> of <prn id='Q1166183'>Trophonius</prn>; the image, made by <prn id='Q105290'>Praxiteles</prn>, is after the likeness of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>. There is also a sanctuary of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> surnamed <prn id='Q107349842'>Europa</prn>, and a <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q107246891'>Hyetios</prn> (rain-god) in the open. If you go up to the oracle, and thence onwards up the mountain, you come to what is called <prn id='Q45967'>Kore</prn>'s Hunting and a <pl id='Q106497024'>temple</pl> of King <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> [Basileus]. This temple they have left half finished, either because of its size or because of the long succession of the wars. In a second temple are images of <prn id='Q44204'>Cronus</prn>, <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> and <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>. There is also a sanctuary of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>. </p>
<p id='9.39.5'><b>9.39.5</b> What happens at the oracle is as follows. When a man has made up his mind to descend to the <pl id='Q12880663'>oracle</pl> of <prn id='Q1166183'>Trophonius</prn>, he first lodges in a certain building for an appointed number of days, this being sacred to the good Spirit [agathos daimon] and to good <prn id='Q213440'>Fortune</prn>. While he lodges there, among other regulations for purity he abstains from hot baths, bathing only in the river <pl id='Q106496258'>Hercyna</pl>. Meat he has in plenty from the sacrifices, for he who descends sacrifices to <prn id='Q1166183'>Trophonius</prn> himself and to the children of <prn id='Q1166183'>Trophonius</prn>, to <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> also and <prn id='Q44204'>Cronus</prn>, to <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> Basileus, to <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> Henioche [charioteer], and to <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> whom they surname <prn id='Q107349842'>Europa</prn> and say was the nurse of <prn id='Q1166183'>Trophonius</prn>. </p>
<p id='9.39.6'><b>9.39.6</b> At each sacrifice a diviner is present, who looks into the entrails of the victim, and after an inspection prophesies to the person descending whether <prn id='Q1166183'>Trophonius</prn> will give him a kind and gracious reception. The entrails of the other victims do not declare the mind of <prn id='Q1166183'>Trophonius</prn> so much as a ram, which each inquirer sacrifices over a pit on the night he descends, calling upon <prn id='Q390363'>Agamedes</prn>. Even though the previous sacrifices have appeared propitious, no account is taken of them unless the entrails of this ram indicate the same; but if they agree, then the inquirer descends in good hope. The procedure of the descent is this. </p>
<p id='9.39.7'><b>9.39.7</b> First, during the night he is taken to the river <pl id='Q106496258'>Hercyna</pl> by two boys of the citizens about thirteen years old, named Hermae, who after taking him there anoint him with oil and wash him. It is these who wash the descender, and do all the other necessary services as his attendant boys. After this he is taken by the priests, not at once to the oracle, but to fountains of water very near to each other. </p>
<p id='9.39.8'><b>9.39.8</b> Here he must drink water called the water called <prn id='Q161096'>Lethe</prn> (Oblivion), that there be oblivion of all that he has been thinking of hitherto, and afterwards he drinks of another water, the water of <prn id='Q102884'>Mnemosyne</prn> (memory), which causes him to remember what he sees after his descent. After looking at the agalma which they say was made by <prn id='Q134756'>Daedalus</prn> (it is not shown by the priests save to such as are going to visit <prn id='Q1166183'>Trophonius</prn>), having seen it, worshipped it and prayed, he proceeds to the oracle, dressed in a linen tunic, with ribbons girding it, and wearing the boots of the country. </p>
<p id='9.39.9'><b>9.39.9</b> The oracle is on the mountain, beyond the grove. Round it is a circular basement (crepis) of white marble, the circumference of which is about that of the smallest threshing floor, while its height is just short of two cubits. On the basement stand spikes, which, like the cross-bars holding them together, are of bronze, while through them has been made a double door. Within the enclosure is a chasm in the earth, not natural, but artificially constructed after the most accurate masonry. </p>
<p id='9.39.10'><b>9.39.10</b> The shape of this structure is like that of a bread-oven. Its breadth across the middle one might conjecture to be about four cubits, and its depth also could not be estimated to extend to more than eight cubits. They have made no way of descent to the bottom, but when a man comes to <prn id='Q1166183'>Trophonius</prn>, they bring him a narrow, light ladder. After going down he finds a hole between the floor and the structure. Its breadth appeared to be two spans, and its height one span. </p>
<p id='9.39.11'><b>9.39.11</b> The descender lies with his back on the ground, holding barley-cakes kneaded with honey, thrusts his feet into the hole and himself follows, trying hard to get his knees into the hole. After his knees the rest of his body is at once swiftly drawn in, just as the largest and most rapid river will catch a man in its eddy and carry him under. After this those who have entered the adyton learn the future, not in one and the same way in all cases, but by sight sometimes and at other times by hearing. The return upwards is by the same mouth, the feet darting out first. </p>
<p id='9.39.12'><b>9.39.12</b> They say that no one who has made the descent has been killed, save only one of the bodyguard of <prn id='Q59734'>Demetrius</prn>. But they declare that he performed none of the usual rites in the sanctuary, and that he descended, not to consult the god but in the hope of stealing gold and silver from the shrine. It is said that the body of this man appeared in a different place, and was not cast out at the sacred mouth. Other tales are told about the fellow, but I have given the one most worthy of consideration. </p>
<p id='9.39.13'><b>9.39.13</b> After his ascent from <prn id='Q1166183'>Trophonius</prn> the inquirer is again taken in hand by the priests, who set him upon a chair called the throne of <prn id='Q102884'>Memory</prn>, which stands not far from the adyton, and they ask of him, when seated there, all he has seen or learned. After gaining this information they then entrust him to his relatives. These lift him, paralyzed with terror and unconscious both of himself and of his surroundings, and carry him to the building where he lodged before with <prn id='Q213440'>Good Fortune</prn> and the <prn id='Q391553'>Good Daimon</prn>. Afterwards, however, he will recover all his faculties, and the power to laugh will return to him. </p>
<p id='9.39.14'><b>9.39.14</b> What I write is not hearsay; I have myself inquired of <prn id='Q1166183'>Trophonius</prn> and seen other inquirers. Those who have descended into the <pl id='Q12880663'>shrine</pl> of <prn id='Q1166183'>Trophonius</prn> are obliged to dedicate a tablet on which is written all that each has heard or seen. The shield also of <prn id='Q1258025'>Aristomenes</prn> is still preserved here. Its story I have already given in a former part of my work. </p>
<p id='9.40.1'><b>9.40.1</b> XL. This oracle was once unknown to the <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotians</pl>, but they learned of it in the following way. As there had been no rain for a year and more, they sent to <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> envoys from each city. These asked for a cure for the drought, and were bidden by the <prn id='Q220344'>Pythian priestess</prn> to go to <prn id='Q1166183'>Trophonius</prn> at <pl id='Q11931280'>Lebadeia</pl> and to discover the remedy from him. </p>
<p id='9.40.2'><b>9.40.2</b> Coming to <pl id='Q11931280'>Lebadeia</pl> they could not find the oracle. Thereupon <prn id='Q12884268'>Saon</prn>, one of the envoys from the city <pl id='Q15394073'>Acraephnium</pl> and the oldest of all the envoys, saw a swarm of <prn id='Q102857'>bees</prn>. It occurred to him to follow himself wheresoever the <prn id='Q102857'>bees</prn> turned. At once he saw the <prn id='Q102857'>bees</prn> flying into the ground here, and he went with them into the oracle. It is said that <prn id='Q1166183'>Trophonius</prn> taught this <prn id='Q12884268'>Saon</prn> the customary ritual, and all the observances kept at the oracle. </p>
<p id='9.40.3'><b>9.40.3</b> Of the works of <prn id='Q134756'>Daedalus</prn> there are these two in <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl>, a <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> in <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> and the <prn id='Q1166183'>Trophonius</prn> at <pl id='Q11931280'>Lebadeia</pl>. There are also two <prn id='Q693222'>xoana</prn> in <pl id='Q4752820'>Crete</pl>, a <prn id='Q831577'>Britomartis</prn> at <pl id='Q2215268'>Olus</pl> and an <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> at <pl id='Q173527'>Cnossus</pl>, at which latter place is also <prn id='Q184874'>Ariadne</prn>'s Dance, mentioned by <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> in the <prn id='Q8275'>Iliad</prn>, carved in relief on white marble. At <pl id='Q106802906'>Delos</pl>, too, there is a small <prn id='Q693222'>xoanon</prn> of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>, its right hand defaced by time, and with a square base instead of feet. </p>
<p id='9.40.4'><b>9.40.4</b> I am of opinion that <prn id='Q184874'>Ariadne</prn> got this image from <prn id='Q134756'>Daedalus</prn>, and when she followed <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>, took it with her from home. Bereft of <prn id='Q184874'>Ariadne</prn>, say the <pl id='Q173148'>Delians</pl>, <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> dedicated the <prn id='Q693222'>xoanon</prn> of the goddess to the <pl id='Q106802906'>Delian</pl> <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, lest by taking it home he should be dragged into remembering <prn id='Q184874'>Ariadne</prn>, and so find the grief for his love ever renewed. I know of no other works of <prn id='Q134756'>Daedalus</prn> still in existence. For the images dedicated by the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> in the <pl id='Q1607754'>Heraeum</pl> and those brought from <pl id='Q23640647'>Omphace</pl> to <pl id='Q58008539'>Gela</pl> in <pl id='Q4951156'>Sicily</pl> have disappeared in course of time. </p>
<p id='9.40.5'><b>9.40.5</b> Next to <pl id='Q11931280'>Lebadeia</pl> comes <pl id='Q13574678'>Chaeroneia</pl>. Its name of old was <pl id='Q16488813'>Arne</pl>, said to have been a daughter of <prn id='Q406388'>Aeolus</prn>, who gave her name also to a <pl id='Q16554823'>city</pl> in <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessaly</pl>. The present name of <pl id='Q13574678'>Chaeroneia</pl>, they say, is derived from <prn id='Q3667219'>Chaeron</prn>, reputed to be a son of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> by <prn id='Q3984506'>Thero</prn>, a daughter of <prn id='Q3744924'>Phylas</prn>. This is confirmed also by the writer of the epic poem, the <prn id='Q1233074'>Great Eoeae</prn>: </p>
<p id='9.40.6'><b>9.40.6</b> “<prn id='Q3744924'>Phylas</prn> wedded a daughter of famous <prn id='Q504076'>Iolaus</prn>, <prn id='Q2393201'>Leipephilene</prn>, like in form to the <pl id='Q80344'>Olympian</pl> goddesses; She bore him in the halls a son <prn id='Q1620063'>Hippotes</prn>, And lovely <prn id='Q3984506'>Thero</prn>, like to the moonbeams. <prn id='Q3984506'>Thero</prn>, falling into the embrace of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, Bore mighty <prn id='Q3667219'>Chaeron</prn>, tamer of <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn>.” <br><prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>, I think, though he knew that <pl id='Q13574678'>Chaeroneia</pl> and <pl id='Q11931280'>Lebadeia</pl> were already so called, yet uses their ancient names, just as he speaks of the river Egyptus, not the <pl id='Q3392'>Nile</pl>. </p>
<p id='9.40.7'><b>9.40.7</b> In the territory of <pl id='Q13574678'>Chaeroneia</pl> are two <pl id='Q6924107'>trophies</pl>, which the Romans under <prn id='Q483783'>Sulla</prn> set up to commemorate their victory over the army of <prn id='Q185126'>Mithridates</prn> under <prn id='Q2460883'>Taxilus</prn>. But <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn>, son of <prn id='Q313907'>Amyntas</prn>, set up no trophy, neither here nor for any other success, whether won over Greeks or non-Greeks, as the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> were not accustomed to raise trophies. </p>
<p id='9.40.8'><b>9.40.8</b> The <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> say that <prn id='Q313910'>Caranus</prn>, king of <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl>, overcame in battle <prn id='Q2259929'>Cisseus</prn>, a chieftain in a bordering country. For his victory <prn id='Q313910'>Caranus</prn> set up a trophy after the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl> fashion, but it is said to have been upset by a <prn id='Q140'>lion</prn> from <pl id='Q80344'>Olympus</pl>, which then vanished. </p>
<p id='9.40.9'><b>9.40.9</b> <prn id='Q313910'>Caranus</prn>, they assert, realized that it was a mistaken policy to incur the undying hatred of the non-Greeks dwelling around, and so, they say, the rule was adopted that no king of <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl>, neither <prn id='Q313910'>Caranus</prn> himself nor any of his successors, should set up trophies, if they were ever to gain the good-will of their neighbors. This story is confirmed by the fact that <prn id='Q8409'>Alexander</prn> set up no trophies, neither for his victory over <prn id='Q102865'>Dareius</prn> nor for those he won in <pl id='Q17055962'>India</pl>. </p>
<p id='9.40.10'><b>9.40.10</b> As you approach the city you see a <pl id='Q56952437'>common grave</pl> of the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> who were killed in the struggle against <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn>. It has no inscription, but is surmounted by a <prn id='Q140'>lion</prn>, probably a reference to the spirit of the men. That there is no inscription is, in my opinion, because their courage was not favoured by appropriate good fortune. </p>
<p id='9.40.11'><b>9.40.11</b> Of the gods, the people of <pl id='Q13574678'>Chaeroneia</pl> honor most the scepter which <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> says <prn id='Q44384'>Hephaestus</prn> made for <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> received from <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> and gave to <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn>, <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn> left to <prn id='Q192469'>Atreus</prn>, <prn id='Q192469'>Atreus</prn> to <prn id='Q622504'>Thyestes</prn>, and <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn> had from <prn id='Q622504'>Thyestes</prn>. This scepter, then, they worship, calling it Doru (Spear). That there is something peculiarly divine about this scepter is most clearly shown by the fame it brings to the <pl id='Q13574678'>Chaeroneans</pl>. </p>
<p id='9.40.12'><b>9.40.12</b> They say that it was discovered on the border of their own country and of <pl id='Q2002148'>Panopeus</pl> in <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl>, that with it the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> discovered gold, and that they were glad themselves to get the scepter instead of the gold. I am of opinion that it was brought to <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl> by <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn>'s daughter <prn id='Q131651'>Electra</prn>. It has no public temple made for it, but its priest keeps the scepter for one year in a house. Sacrifices are offered to it every day, and by its side stands a table full of meats and cakes of all sorts. </p>
<p id='9.41.1'><b>9.41.1</b> Poets have sung, and the tradition of men has followed them, that <prn id='Q44384'>Hephaestus</prn> made many works of art, but none is authentic except only the scepter of <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn>. However, the <pl id='Q18927'>Lycians</pl> in <pl id='Q233121'>Patara</pl> show a bronze bowl in their temple of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, saying that <prn id='Q916442'>Telephus</prn> dedicated it and <prn id='Q44384'>Hephaestus</prn> made it, apparently in ignorance of the fact that the first to melt bronze were the <pl id='Q13580795'>Samians</pl> <prn id='Q3286634'>Theodorus</prn> and <prn id='Q1851693'>Rhoecus</prn>. </p>
<p id='9.41.2'><b>9.41.2</b> The <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> of <pl id='Q133123'>Patrae</pl> assert indeed that <prn id='Q44384'>Hephaestus</prn> made the chest brought by <prn id='Q1588440'>Eurypylus</prn> from <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl>, but they do not actually exhibit it to view. In <pl id='Q644636'>Cyprus</pl> is a city <pl id='Q2343313'>Amathus</pl>, in which is an old sanctuary of <prn id='Q163920'>Adonis</prn> and <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>. Here they say is dedicated a necklace given originally to <prn id='Q978079'>Harmonia</prn>, but called the necklace of <prn id='Q1125040'>Eriphyle</prn>, because it was the bribe she took to betray her husband. It was dedicated at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> by the sons of <prn id='Q2329005'>Phegeus</prn> (how they got it I have already related in my history of <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl>), but it was carried off by the tyrants of <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl>. </p>
<p id='9.41.3'><b>9.41.3</b> However, I do not think that it is in the sanctuary of <prn id='Q163920'>Adonis</prn> at <pl id='Q2343313'>Amathus</pl>. For the necklace at <pl id='Q2343313'>Amathus</pl> is composed of green stones held together by gold, but the necklace given to <prn id='Q1125040'>Eriphyle</prn> was made entirely of gold, according to <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>, who says in the <prn id='Q35160'>Odyssey</prn>: “Who received precious gold, the price of her own husband.” Not that <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> was unaware of necklaces made of various materials. </p>
<p id='9.41.4'><b>9.41.4</b> For example, in the speech of <prn id='Q1333846'>Eumaeus</prn> to <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn> before <prn id='Q192482'>Telemachus</prn> reaches the court from <pl id='Q2047396'>Pylus</pl>, he says: “There came a cunning man to the home of my father, With a necklace of gold strung with amber in between.” </p>
<p id='9.41.5'><b>9.41.5</b> Again, in the passage called the gifts of <prn id='Q165769'>Penelope</prn>, for he represents the wooers, <prn id='Q3060909'>Eurymachus</prn> among them, offering her gifts, he says: “And <prn id='Q3060909'>Eurymachus</prn> straightway brought a necklace of varied materials, Of gold strung with pieces of amber, like the sun.” But <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> does not say that the necklace given to <prn id='Q1125040'>Eriphyle</prn> was of gold varied with stones. So probably the scepter is the only work of <prn id='Q44384'>Hephaestus</prn>. </p>
<p id='9.41.6'><b>9.41.6</b> There is beyond the city a crag called PetrachusYY. Here they hold that <prn id='Q44204'>Cronus</prn> was deceived, and received from <prn id='Q108419'>Rhea</prn> a stone instead of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, and there is a small image of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> on the summit of the mountain. </p>
<p id='9.41.7'><b>9.41.7</b> Here in <pl id='Q13574678'>Chaeroneia</pl> they distil unguents from flowers, namely, the lily, the rose, the narcissus and the iris. These prove to be cures for the pains of men. The unguent from the rose, if it be smeared on wooden images, prevents their decaying. The iris grows in marshes, is in size as large as a lily, but is not white in color, and smells less sweet. </p>
<p id='10.1.1'><b>10.1.1</b> BOOK 10 <br>It is plain that such part of <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl> as is around <pl id='Q56697763'>Tithorea</pl> and <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> was so named in very ancient days after a <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthian</pl>, <prn id='Q836311'>Phocus</prn>, a son of <prn id='Q2031315'>Ornytion</prn>. Not many years afterwards, the name established itself as the received title of what is today called <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl>, when the <pl id='Q191082'>Aeginetans</pl> had disembarked on the land with <prn id='Q836311'>Phocus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q206187'>Aeacus</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.1.2'><b>10.1.2</b> Opposite the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl>, and in the direction of <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl>, <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl> stretches to the sea, and touches it on one side at <pl id='Q56754242'>Cirrha</pl>, the port of <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>, and on the other at the city of <pl id='Q4774674'>Anticyra</pl>. In the direction of the <pl id='Q549658'>Lamian Gulf</pl> there are between <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl> and the sea only the Hypocnemidian Locrians. By these is <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl> bounded in this direction, by <pl id='Q3475188'>Scarpheia</pl> on the other side of <pl id='Q1235347'>Elateia</pl>, and by <pl id='Q771434'>Opus</pl> and its port <pl id='Q5200184'>Cynus</pl> beyond <pl id='Q1534902'>Hyampolis</pl> and <pl id='Q304823'>Abae</pl>. </p>
<p id='10.1.3'><b>10.1.3</b> The most renowned exploits of the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocian</pl> people were undertaken by the whole nation. They took part in the <prn id='Q42937'>Trojan War</prn>, and fought against the <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessalians</pl> before the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl> invasion of Greece, when they accomplished some noteworthy deeds. Expecting that the <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessalians</pl> would invade their land at <pl id='Q1534902'>Hyampolis</pl>, they buried there earthen water-pots, covered these with earth, and so waited for the <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessalian</pl> cavalry. Ignorant of the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocian</pl> stratagem, the <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessalians</pl> without knowing it drove their <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn> on to the water-pots, where stumbling into them the <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn> were lamed, and threw or killed their riders. </p>
<p id='10.1.4'><b>10.1.4</b> The <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessalians</pl>, more enraged than ever against the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl>, gathered levies from all their cities and marched out against them. Whereupon the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl>, greatly terrified at the army of the <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessalians</pl>, especially at the number of their cavalry and the practised discipline of both mounts and riders, despatched a mission to <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>, praying the god that they might escape the danger that threatened them. The oracle given them was this: “I will match in fight mortal and immortal, And to both will I give victory, but more to the mortal.” </p>
<p id='10.1.5'><b>10.1.5</b> On receiving this oracle, the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> sent three hundred picked men with <prn id='Q468608'>Gelon</prn> in command to make an attack on the enemy. The night was just falling, and the orders given were to reconnoiter without being observed, to return to the main body by the least known route, and to remain strictly on the defensive. These picked men along with their leader <prn id='Q468608'>Gelon</prn>, trampled on by <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn> and butchered by their enemies, perished to a man at the hands of the <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessalians</pl>. </p>
<p id='10.1.6'><b>10.1.6</b> Their disaster created such panic among the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> in the camp that they actually gathered together in one spot their women, children, movable property, and also their clothes, gold, silver and images of the gods, and making a vast pyre they left in charge a force of thirty men. </p>
<p id='10.1.7'><b>10.1.7</b> These were under orders that, should the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> chance to be worsted in the battle, they were first to put to death the women and the children, then to lay them like victims with the valuables on the pyre, and finally to set it alight and perish themselves, either by each other's hands or by charging the cavalry of the <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessalians</pl>. Hence all forlorn hopes are called by the Greeks “<pl id='Q2637650'>Phocian</pl> despair.” On this occasion the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> forthwith proceeded to attack the <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessalians</pl>. </p>
<p id='10.1.8'><b>10.1.8</b> The commander of their cavalry was <prn id='Q91121874'>Daiphantes</prn> of <pl id='Q1534902'>Hyampolis</pl>, of their infantry <prn id='Q87192566'>Rhoeus</prn> of <pl id='Q12872250'>Ambrossus</pl>. But the office of commander-in-chief was held by <prn id='Q11953845'>Tellias</prn>, a seer of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>, upon whom rested all the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl>' hopes of salvation. </p>
<p id='10.1.9'><b>10.1.9</b> When the battle joined, the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> had before their eyes what they had resolved to do to their women and children, and seeing that their own salvation trembled in the balance, they dared the most desperate deeds, and, with the favour of heaven, achieved the most famous victory of that time. </p>
<p id='10.1.10'><b>10.1.10</b> Then did all Greece understand the oracle given to the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> by <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>. For the watchword given in battle on every occasion by the <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessalian</pl> generals was Itonian <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, and by the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocian</pl> generals <prn id='Q3381352'>Phocus</prn>, from whom the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> were named. Because of this engagement the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> sent as offerings to <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> statues of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, of <prn id='Q11953845'>Tellias</prn> the seer, and of all their other generals in the battle, together with images of their local heroes. The figures were the work of the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl> <prn id='Q15619681'>Aristomedon</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.1.11'><b>10.1.11</b> Afterwards the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> discovered a stratagem quite as clever as their former ones. For when the armies were lying opposite each other at the pass into <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl>, five hundred picked men of <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl>, waiting until the moon was full, attacked the <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessalians</pl> on that night, first smearing themselves with chalk and, in addition to the chalk, putting on white armour. It is said that there then occurred a wholesale slaughter of the <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessalians</pl>, who thought this apparition of the night to be too unearthly to be an attack of their enemies. It was <prn id='Q11953845'>Tellias</prn> of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> who devised this stratagem also for the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> to use against the <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessalians</pl>. </p>
<p id='10.2.1'><b>10.2.1</b> When the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl> army crossed into Europe, it is said that the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> were forced to join the Great King, but deserted the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl> cause and ranged themselves with the Greeks at the battle of <pl id='Q204636'>Plataea</pl>. Subsequently it happened that a fine was inflicted on them by the <prn id='Q182875'>Amphictyons</prn>. I cannot find out the truth of the story, whether the fine was inflicted because of the misdeeds of the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl>, or whether the <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessalians</pl> exacted the fine from the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> because of their ancient hatred. </p>
<p id='10.2.2'><b>10.2.2</b> As they were disheartened at the greatness of the fine, <prn id='Q4484273'>Philomelus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q91109231'>Theotimus</prn>, than whom no <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocian</pl> stood higher in rank, his country being <pl id='Q3807754'>Ledon</pl>, a city of <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl>, took charge and tried to persuade them to seize the sanctuary at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>, pointing out that the amount of the sum to be paid was beyond their resources. He stated, among other plausible arguments, that <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> and <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> had always been favorable to them, and that if <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> or any other state made war against them, they would have the better owing to their courage and resources. </p>
<p id='10.2.3'><b>10.2.3</b> When <prn id='Q4484273'>Philomelus</prn> put all this before them, the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> were nothing loath, either because their judgment was blinded by heaven, or because their nature was to put gain before religion. The seizure of <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> by the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> occurred when HeracleidYY was president at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> and <prn id='Q87986289'>Agathocles</prn> archon at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, in the fourth year of the <prn id='Q57337797'>hundred and fifth Olympiad</prn> [357 BCE], when <prn id='Q20852053'>Prorus</prn> of <pl id='Q44112'>Cyrene</pl> was victorious in the foot-race. </p>
<p id='10.2.4'><b>10.2.4</b> When they had seized the sanctuary, the best mercenaries in Greece at once mustered to join them, while the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl>, at variance before, declared open war against them. The war lasted ten successive years, and during this long time victory often fell to the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> and their mercenaries, and often the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> proved the better. An engagement took place at the town of <pl id='Q56697763'>Neon</pl>, in which the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> were worsted, and in the rout <prn id='Q4484273'>Philomelus</prn> threw himself down a high precipice, and so lost his life. This was the very punishment fixed by the <prn id='Q182875'>Amphictyons</prn> for spoilers of the sanctuary. </p>
<p id='10.2.5'><b>10.2.5</b> After the death of <prn id='Q4484273'>Philomelus</prn> the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> gave the command to <prn id='Q2584301'>Onomarchus</prn>, while <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn>, son of <prn id='Q313907'>Amyntas</prn>, made an alliance with the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl>. <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn> had the better of the encounter, and <prn id='Q2584301'>Onomarchus</prn> fleeing to the coast was there shot down by his own troops, who considered their defeat due to his lack of enterprise and inexperience as a general. </p>
<p id='10.2.6'><b>10.2.6</b> Such was the end which the daemon brought upon <prn id='Q2584301'>Onomarchus</prn>, and his brother <prn id='Q16555097'>Phaylus</prn> was chosen as strategos. It is said that no sooner had this <prn id='Q16555097'>Phaylus</prn> come to rule over the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> when he saw the following vision in a dream. Among the votive offerings to <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> was a representation in bronze of a man's body in an advanced stage of decay, with the flesh already fallen off, and nothing left but the bones. The <pl id='Q75459'>Delphians</pl> said that it was an offering of <prn id='Q5264'>Hippocrates</prn> the physician. Now the thought came to <prn id='Q16555097'>Phaylus</prn> that he resembled this offering. Forthwith he was attacked by a wasting disease, which so fulfilled the omen of the dream. </p>
<p id='10.2.7'><b>10.2.7</b> On the death of <prn id='Q16555097'>Phaylus</prn> the sovereignty of the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> devolved on <prn id='Q3278695'>Phalaecus</prn> his son. <prn id='Q3278695'>Phalaecus</prn>, accused of appropriating to his own use the sacred treasures, was deposed, and crossing with a fleet to <pl id='Q4752820'>Crete</pl>, accompanied by such <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> as sided with him and by a part of his mercenaries, he sat down to besiege <pl id='Q1481525'>Cydonia</pl>, which refused to accede to his demand for money, and perished along with the greater part of his army. </p>
<p id='10.3.1'><b>10.3.1</b> In the tenth year after the seizure of the sanctuary, <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn> put an end to the war, which was called both the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocian</pl> War and the Sacred War, in the year when <prn id='Q108823677'>Theophilus was archon</prn> [348/7 BCE] at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, which was the first of the <prn id='Q57337801'>hundred and eighth Olympiad</prn> at which <prn id='Q7226231'>Polycles</prn> of <pl id='Q44112'>Cyrene</pl> was victorious in the foot-race. The cities of <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl> were captured and razed to the ground. The tale of them was <pl id='Q1267602'>Lilaea</pl>, <pl id='Q1534902'>Hyampolis</pl>, <pl id='Q4774674'>Anticyra</pl>, <pl id='Q15674594'>Parapotamii</pl>, <pl id='Q2002148'>Panopeus</pl> and <pl id='Q1172948'>Daulis</pl>. These cities were distinguished in days of old, especially because of the poetry of <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.3.2'><b>10.3.2</b> The army of <prn id='Q129165'>Xerxes</prn>, burning down certain of these, made them better known in Greece, namely <pl id='Q12872519'>Erochus</pl>, <pl id='Q15689549'>Charadra</pl>, <pl id='Q474840'>Amphicleia</pl>, <pl id='Q56697763'>Neon</pl>, <pl id='Q12885360'>Tithronium</pl> and <pl id='Q11917777'>Drymaea</pl>. The rest of the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocian</pl> cities, except <pl id='Q1235347'>Elateia</pl>, were not famous in former times, I mean Phocian <pl id='Q16642266'>Trachis</pl>, Phocian <pl id='Q12771305'>Medeon</pl>, <pl id='Q16259799'>Echedameia</pl>, <pl id='Q12872250'>Ambrossus</pl>, <pl id='Q3807754'>Ledon</pl>, <pl id='Q16261484'>Phlygonium</pl> and <pl id='Q12884846'>Stiris</pl>. On the occasion to which I have referred all the cities enumerated were razed to the ground and their people scattered in villages. The one exception to this treatment was <pl id='Q304823'>Abae</pl>, whose citizens were free from impiety, and had had no share in the seizure of the sanctuary or in the war. </p>
<p id='10.3.3'><b>10.3.3</b> The <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> were deprived of their share in the <pl id='Q682558'>Delphic</pl> sanctuary and in the Greek assembly, and their votes were given by the <prn id='Q182875'>Amphictyons</prn> to the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl>. Subsequently, however, the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocian</pl> cities were rebuilt, and their inhabitants restored from the villages to their native cities, save such as were prevented from being rebuilt by their original weakness and by their want of funds at the period of restoration. It was the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> and <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> who brought back the inhabitants before the disaster of <pl id='Q13574678'>Chaeroneia</pl> befell the Greeks. </p>
<p id='10.3.4'><b>10.3.4</b> The <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> took part in the battle of <pl id='Q13574678'>Chaeroneia</pl>, and afterwards fought at <pl id='Q192980'>Lamia</pl> and <pl id='Q56427665'>Crannon</pl> against the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> under <prn id='Q204760'>Antipater</prn>. No Greeks were keener defenders against the Gauls and the <pl id='Q35966'>Celtic</pl> invaders than were the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl>, who considered that they were helping the god of <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>, and at the same time, I take it, that they were making amends for the old crimes they had committed. </p>
<p id='10.4.1'><b>10.4.1</b> Such were the memorable exploits of the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl>. From <pl id='Q13574678'>Chaeroneia</pl> it is twenty stades to <pl id='Q2002148'>Panopeus</pl>, a city of the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl>, if one can give the name of city to those who possess no government offices, no gymnasium, no theater, no agora, no water descending to a fountain, but live in bare shelters just like mountain cabins, right on a ravine. Nevertheless, they have boundaries with their neighbors, and even send delegates to the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocian</pl> assembly. The name of the city is derived, they say, from the father of <prn id='Q278930'>Epeius</prn>, and they maintain that they are not <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl>, but were originally <prn id='Q18629873'>Phlegyans</prn> who fled to <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl> from the land of <pl id='Q543895'>Orchomenus</pl>. </p>
<p id='10.4.2'><b>10.4.2</b> A survey of the ancient circuit of <pl id='Q2002148'>Panopeus</pl> led me to guess it to be about seven stades. I was reminded of <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>'s verses about <prn id='Q656887'>Tityos</prn>, where he mentions the city of <pl id='Q2002148'>Panopeus</pl> with its beautiful dancing-floors, and how in the fight over the body of <prn id='Q186271'>Patroclus</prn> he says that <prn id='Q17282472'>Schedius</prn>, son of <prn id='Q2731769'>Iphitus</prn> and king of the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl>, who was killed by <prn id='Q159666'>Hector</prn>, lived in <pl id='Q2002148'>Panopeus</pl>. It seemed to me that the reason why the king lived here was fear of the <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotians</pl>; at this point is the easiest pass from <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl> into <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl>, so the king used <pl id='Q2002148'>Panopeus</pl> as a fortified post. </p>
<p id='10.4.3'><b>10.4.3</b> The former passage, in which <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> speaks of the beautiful dancing-floors of <pl id='Q2002148'>Panopeus</pl>, I could not understand until I was taught by the women whom the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> call <prn id='Q3526162'>Thyiads</prn>. The <prn id='Q3526162'>Thyiads</prn> are <pl id='Q122443'>Attic</pl> women, who with the <pl id='Q682558'>Delphian</pl> women go to <pl id='Q105261'>Parnassus</pl> every other year and celebrate orgies in honor of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>. It is the custom for these <prn id='Q3526162'>Thyiads</prn> to hold dances at places, including <pl id='Q2002148'>Panopeus</pl>, along the road from <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>. The epithet <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> applies to <pl id='Q2002148'>Panopeus</pl> is thought to refer to the dance of the <prn id='Q3526162'>Thyiads</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.4.4'><b>10.4.4</b> At <pl id='Q2002148'>Panopeus</pl> there is by the roadside a small building of unburnt brick, in which is an image of <pl id='Q1125206'>Pentelic</pl> marble, said by some to be <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>, by others <prn id='Q83160'>Prometheus</prn>. The latter produce evidence of their contention. At the ravine there lie two stones, each of which is big enough to fill a cart. They have the color of clay, not earthy clay, but such as would be found in a ravine or sandy torrent, and they smell very like the skin of a man. They say that these are remains of the clay out of which the whole race of mankind was fashioned by <prn id='Q83160'>Prometheus</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.4.5'><b>10.4.5</b> Here at the ravine is the tomb of <prn id='Q656887'>Tityos</prn>. The circumference of the mound is just about one-third of a stade, and they say that the verse in the <prn id='Q35160'>Odyssey</prn>: “Lying on the ground, and he lay over nine roods,” refers, not to the size of <prn id='Q656887'>Tityos</prn>, but to the place where he lay, the name of which was Nine Roods (Plethra Ennea). </p>
<p id='10.4.6'><b>10.4.6</b> <prn id='Q81642593'>Cleon</prn> of <pl id='Q60790367'>Magnesia</pl> on the <pl id='Q1351474'>Hermus</pl> used to say that those men were incredulous of wonders who in the course of their own lives had not met yet greater marvels. He declared that <prn id='Q656887'>Tityos</prn> and other monsters had been as tradition says they were. He happened, he said, to be at <pl id='Q5890310'>Gadeira</pl>, and he, with the rest of the crowd, sailed forth from the island in accordance with the command of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>; on their return to <pl id='Q5890310'>Gadeira</pl> they found cast ashore a man of the sea, who was about five roods in size, and burning away, because heaven had blasted him with a thunderbolt. </p>
<p id='10.4.7'><b>10.4.7</b> So said <prn id='Q81642593'>Cleon</prn>. About twenty-seven stades distant from <pl id='Q2002148'>Panopeus</pl> is <pl id='Q1172948'>Daulis</pl>. The men there are few in number, but for size and strength no <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> are more renowned even to this day. They say that the name of the city is derived from <pl id='Q1172948'>Daulis</pl>, a nymph, the daughter of the <pl id='Q1235405'>Cephisus</pl>. Others say that the place, on which the city was built, was wooded, and that such shaggy places (dasea) were called daula by the ancients. For this reason, they say, <prn id='Q40939'>Aeschylus</prn> called the beard of <prn id='Q385397'>Glaucus</prn> of <pl id='Q2857905'>Anthedon</pl> hypene daulos. </p>
<p id='10.4.8'><b>10.4.8</b> Here in <pl id='Q1172948'>Daulis</pl> the women are said to have served up to <prn id='Q1138506'>Tereus</prn> his own son, which act was the first pollution of the dining-table among men. The hoopoe, into which the legend says <prn id='Q1138506'>Tereus</prn> was changed, is a bird a little larger than the quail, while the feathers on its head rise into the shape of a crest. </p>
<p id='10.4.9'><b>10.4.9</b> It is noteworthy that in <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl> swallows neither hatch nor lay eggs; in fact no swallow would even make a nest in the roof of a house. The <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> say that even when <prn id='Q115449'>Philomela</prn> was a bird she had a terror of <prn id='Q1138506'>Tereus</prn>, and so kept away from his country. At <pl id='Q1172948'>Daulis</pl> is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> with an ancient image. The xoanon, of an even earlier date, the <pl id='Q1172948'>Daulians</pl> say was brought from <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> by <prn id='Q1231743'>Procne</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.4.10'><b>10.4.10</b> In the territory of <pl id='Q1172948'>Daulis</pl> is a place called <pl id='Q17563248'>Tronis</pl>. Here has been built a shrine of the ArchegeteYY (Founder) hero. This founder is said by some to have been <prn id='Q91111185'>Xanthippus</prn>, a distinguished soldier; others say that he was <prn id='Q3381352'>Phocus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q2031315'>Ornytion</prn>, son of <prn id='Q102561'>Sisyphus</prn>. At any rate, he is worshipped every day, and the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> bring victims and pour the blood into the grave through a hole, but the flesh they are wont to consume on the spot. </p>
<p id='10.5.1'><b>10.5.1</b> There is also an ascent through <pl id='Q1172948'>Daulis</pl> to the summit of <pl id='Q105261'>Parnassus</pl>, a longer one than that from <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>, though not so difficult. Turning back from <pl id='Q1172948'>Daulis</pl> to the straight road to <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> and going forwards, you see on the left of the road a building called the <pl id='Q106393075'>Phokikon</pl>, where assemble the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocian</pl> delegates from each city. </p>
<p id='10.5.2'><b>10.5.2</b> The <pl id='Q106393075'>Phokikon</pl> is large, and within are pillars standing throughout its length. From the pillars rise steps to each wall, on which steps the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocian</pl> delegates take their seats. At the end are neither pillars nor steps, but images of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> and <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn>. That of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> is on a throne; on his right stands <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn>, on his left <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.5.3'><b>10.5.3</b> Going forward from here you will come to a road called the <pl id='Q106485600'>Cleft Road</pl>, the very road on which <prn id='Q130890'>Oedipus</prn> slew his father. Fate would have it that memorials of the sufferings of <prn id='Q130890'>Oedipus</prn> should be left throughout the length and breadth of Greece. At his birth they pieced his ankles with goads and exposed him on Mount <pl id='Q1147780'>Cithaeron</pl> in <pl id='Q742538'>Plataean</pl> territory. <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl> and the land at the <pl id='Q215200'>Isthmus</pl> were the scene of his upbringing. <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl> and the <pl id='Q106485600'>Cleft Road</pl> received the pollution of his murdered father's blood. <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> is even more notorious for the marriage of <prn id='Q130890'>Oedipus</prn> and for the sin of <prn id='Q506550'>Eteocles</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.5.4'><b>10.5.4</b> The <pl id='Q106485600'>Cleft Road</pl> and the rash deed committed on it by <prn id='Q130890'>Oedipus</prn> were the beginning of his troubles, and the tombs of <prn id='Q463898'>Laius</prn> and the servant who followed him are still just as they were in the very middle of the place where the three roads meet, and over them have been piled unhewn stones. According to the story, it was <prn id='Q59534018'>Damasistratus</prn>, king of <pl id='Q742538'>Plataea</pl>, who found the bodies lying and buried them. </p>
<p id='10.5.5'><b>10.5.5</b> From here the high road to <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> becomes both steeper and more difficult for the walker. Many and different are the stories told about <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>, and even more so about the oracle of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>. For they say that in the earliest times the oracular seat belonged to <prn id='Q93172'>Earth</prn>, who appointed as prophetess at it <prn id='Q741627'>Daphnis</prn>, one of the nymphs of the mountain. </p>
<p id='10.5.6'><b>10.5.6</b> There is extant among the Greeks an hexameter poem, the name of which is <prn id='Q88209119'>Eumolpia</prn>, and it is assigned to <prn id='Q728059'>Musaeus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q91178752'>Antiophemus</prn>. In it the poet states that the oracle belonged to <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> and <prn id='Q93172'>Earth</prn> in common; that <prn id='Q93172'>Earth</prn> gave her oracles herself, but <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> used <prn id='Q91111187'>Pyrcon</prn> as his mouthpiece in giving responses. The verses are these: <br>“Forthwith the voice of the Chthonian uttered a wise word, <br>And with her Pyrcon, servant of the renowned Earth-shaker.” <br>They say that afterwards <prn id='Q93172'>Earth</prn> gave her share to <prn id='Q159168'>Themis</prn>, who gave it to <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> as a gift. It is said that he gave to <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> <pl id='Q1443132'>Calaureia</pl>, that lies off <pl id='Q581494'>Troezen</pl>, in exchange for his oracle. </p>
<p id='10.5.7'><b>10.5.7</b> I have heard too that shepherds feeding their flocks came upon the oracle, were inspired by the vapor, and prophesied as the mouthpiece of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>. The most prevalent view, however, is that <prn id='Q2993240'>Phemonoe</prn> was the first prophetess of the god, and first sang in hexameter verse. <prn id='Q891047'>Boeo</prn>, a native woman who composed a hymn for the <pl id='Q75459'>Delphians</pl>, said that the oracle was established for the god by comers from the <prn id='Q12871715'>Hyperboreans</prn>, <prn id='Q978308'>Olen</prn> and others, and that he was the first to prophesy and the first to chant the hexameter oracles. </p>
<p id='10.5.8'><b>10.5.8</b> The verses of <prn id='Q891047'>Boeo</prn> are: “Here in truth a mindful oracle was built By the sons of the <prn id='Q12871715'>Hyperboreans</prn>, Pagasus and divine <prn id='Q3848037'>Agyieus</prn>.” After enumerating others also of the <prn id='Q12871715'>Hyperboreans</prn>, at the end of the hymn she names <prn id='Q978308'>Olen</prn>: “And <prn id='Q978308'>Olen</prn>, who became the first prophet of <prn id='Q3382132'>Phoebus</prn>, And first fashioned a song of ancient verses.” Tradition, however, reports no other man as prophet, but makes mention of prophetesses only. </p>
<p id='10.5.9'><b>10.5.9</b> They say that the most ancient <pl id='Q10751359'>temple</pl> of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> was made of laurel, the branches of which were brought from the laurel in <pl id='Q258540'>Tempe</pl>. This temple must have had the form of a hut. The <pl id='Q75459'>Delphians</pl> say that the second temple was made by <prn id='Q102857'>bees</prn> from beeswax and feathers, and that it was sent to the <prn id='Q12871715'>Hyperboreans</prn> by <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.5.10'><b>10.5.10</b> Another story is current, that the <pl id='Q10751359'>temple</pl> was set up by a <pl id='Q682558'>Delphian</pl>, whose name was <prn id='Q91121098'>Pteras</prn>, and so the temple received its name from the builder. After this Pteras, so they say, the city in <pl id='Q4752820'>Crete</pl> was named, with the addition of a letter, <pl id='Q622234'>Aptera</pl>. The story that the temple was built of the fern (pteris) that grows on the mountains, by interweaving fresh stalks of it, I do not accept at all. </p>
<p id='10.5.11'><b>10.5.11</b> It is no wonder that the third <pl id='Q10751359'>temple</pl> was made of bronze, seeing that <prn id='Q208017'>Acrisius</prn> made a bedchamber of bronze for his daughter, the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> still possess a sanctuary of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> of the <pl id='Q57302774'>Bronze House</pl>, and the Roman <pl id='Q478642'>forum</pl>, a marvel for its size and style, possesses a roof of bronze. So it would not be unlikely that a temple of bronze was made for <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.5.12'><b>10.5.12</b> The rest of the story I cannot believe, either that the <pl id='Q10751359'>temple</pl> was the work of <prn id='Q44384'>Hephaestus</prn>, or the legend about the golden singers, referred to by <prn id='Q134929'>Pindar</prn> in his verses about this bronze temple: “Above the pediment sang Golden <prn id='Q16188353'>Keledones</prn> (Charmers). These words, it seems to me, are but an imitation of <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>'s account of the <prn id='Q150986'>Sirens</prn>. Neither did I find the accounts agree of the way this temple disappeared. Some say that it fell into a chasm in the earth, others that it was melted by fire. </p>
<p id='10.5.13'><b>10.5.13</b> The fourth <pl id='Q10751359'>temple</pl> was made by <prn id='Q1166183'>Trophonius</prn> and <prn id='Q390363'>Agamedes</prn>; the tradition is that it was made of stone. It was burnt down in the <prn id='Q108823438'>archonship of Erxicleides</prn> at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, in the first year of the <prn id='Q57337734'>fifty-eighth Olympiad</prn>, when <prn id='Q16549826'>Diognetus</prn> of <pl id='Q13526919'>Crotona</pl> was victorious. The modern <pl id='Q10751359'>temple</pl> was built for the god by the <prn id='Q182875'>Amphictyons</prn> from the sacred treasures, and the architect was one <prn id='Q11920654'>Spintharus</prn> of <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl>. </p>
<p id='10.6.1'><b>10.6.1</b> They say that the oldest city was founded here by <prn id='Q12757032'>Parnassus</prn>, a son of <prn id='Q4040541'>Cleodora</prn>, a nymph. Like the other heroes, as they are called, he had two fathers; one they say was the god <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, the human father being <prn id='Q58024617'>Cleopompus</prn>. After this <pl id='Q105261'>Parnassus</pl> were named, they say, both the mountain and also the <pl id='Q105261'>Parnassian</pl> glen. Augury from flying birds was, it is said, a discovery of <prn id='Q12757032'>Parnassus</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.6.2'><b>10.6.2</b> Now this city, so the story goes on, was flooded by the rains that fell in the time of <prn id='Q207715'>Deucalion</prn>. Such of the inhabitants as were able to escape the storm were led by the howls of <prn id='Q18498'>wolves</prn> to safety on the top of <pl id='Q105261'>Parnassus</pl>, being led on their way by these beasts, and on this account they called the city that they founded <pl id='Q5975192'>Lycoreia</pl> (Mountainwolf-city). </p>
<p id='10.6.3'><b>10.6.3</b> Another and different legend is current that <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> had a son Lycorus by a nymph, <prn id='Q520551'>Corycia</prn>, and that after Lycorus was named the city <pl id='Q5975192'>Lycoreia</pl>, and after the nymph the <pl id='Q2261709'>Corycian</pl> cave. It is also said that <prn id='Q16188357'>Celaeno</prn> was daughter to <prn id='Q11926250'>Hyamus</prn>, son of Lycorus, and that <prn id='Q2322448'>Delphus</prn>, from whom comes the present name of the city, was a son of <prn id='Q16188357'>Celaeno</prn>, daughter of <prn id='Q11926250'>Hyamus</prn>, by <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.6.4'><b>10.6.4</b> Others maintain that <prn id='Q56936702'>Castalius</prn>, an aboriginal, had a daughter <prn id='Q949266'>Thyia</prn>, who was the first to be priestess of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> and celebrate orgies in honor of the god. It is said that later on men called after her <prn id='Q3526162'>Thyiads</prn> all women who rave in honor of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>. At any rate they hold that <prn id='Q2322448'>Delphus</prn> was a son of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> and <prn id='Q949266'>Thyia</prn>. Others say that his mother was <prn id='Q2659035'>Melaena</prn>, daughter of <pl id='Q1235405'>Cephisus</pl>. </p>
<p id='10.6.5'><b>10.6.5</b> Afterwards the dwellers around called the city <pl id='Q682558'>Pytho</pl>, as well as <pl id='Q75459'>Delphi</pl>, just as <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> so calls it in the list of the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl>. Those who would find pedigrees for everything think that <prn id='Q16327666'>Pythes</prn> was a son of <prn id='Q2322448'>Delphus</prn>, and that because he was king the city was called <prn id='Q649128'>Pytho</prn>. But the most widespread tradition has it that the victim of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>'s arrows rotted here, and that this was the reason why the city received the name <pl id='Q682558'>Pytho</pl>. For the men of those days used pythesthai for the verb “to rot,” and hence <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> in his poem says that the island of the <prn id='Q150986'>Sirens</prn> was full of bones, because the men who heard their singing rotted (epythonto). </p>
<p id='10.6.6'><b>10.6.6</b> The poets say that the victim of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> was a <prn id='Q15721'>dragon</prn> posted by <prn id='Q93172'>Earth</prn> to be a guard for the oracle. It is also said that he was a violent son of <prn id='Q91121882'>Crius</prn>, a man with authority around <pl id='Q173096'>Euboea</pl>. He pillaged the sanctuary of the god, and he also pillaged the houses of rich men. But when he was making a second expedition, the <pl id='Q75459'>Delphians</pl> besought <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> to keep from them the danger that threatened them. </p>
<p id='10.6.7'><b>10.6.7</b> <prn id='Q2993240'>Phemonoe</prn>, the prophetess of that day, gave them an oracle in hexameter verse: <br>“At close quarters a grievous arrow shall <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> shoot <br>At the spoiler of <pl id='Q105261'>Parnassus</pl>; and of his blood-guilt <br>The <pl id='Q4752820'>Cretans</pl> shall cleanse his hands; but the renown shall never die. </p>
<p id='10.7.1'><b>10.7.1</b> It seems that from the beginning the sanctuary at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> has been plotted against by a vast number of men. Attacks were made against it by this <pl id='Q173096'>Euboean</pl> <prn id='Q10729326'>pirate</prn>, and years afterwards by the <prn id='Q18629873'>Phlegyan</prn> nation; furthermore by <prn id='Q322639'>Pyrrhus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn>, by a portion of the army of <prn id='Q129165'>Xerxes</prn>, by the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocian</pl> chieftains, whose attacks on the wealth of the god were the longest and fiercest, and by the Gallic invaders. It was fated too that <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> was to suffer from the universal irreverence of <prn id='Q1413'>Nero</prn>, who robbed <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> of five hundred bronze statues, some of gods, some of men. </p>
<p id='10.7.2'><b>10.7.2</b> The oldest contest and the one for which they first offered prizes was, according to tradition, the singing of a hymn to the god. The man who sang and won the prize was <prn id='Q9191502'>Chrysothemis</prn> of <pl id='Q4752820'>Crete</pl>, whose father <prn id='Q11912529'>Carmanor</prn> is said to have cleansed <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>. After <prn id='Q9191502'>Chrysothemis</prn>, says tradition, <prn id='Q53606'>Philammon</prn> won with a song, and after him his son <prn id='Q853014'>Thamyris</prn>. But they say that <prn id='Q174353'>Orpheus</prn>, a proud man and conceited about his mysteries, and <prn id='Q728059'>Musaeus</prn>, who copied <prn id='Q174353'>Orpheus</prn> in everything, refused to submit to the competition in musical skill. </p>
<p id='10.7.3'><b>10.7.3</b> They say too that <prn id='Q1328289'>Eleuther</prn> won a <pl id='Q682558'>Pythian</pl> victory for his loud and sweet voice, for the song that he sang was not of his own composition. The story is that <prn id='Q44233'>Hesiod</prn> too was debarred from competing because he had not learned to accompany his own singing on the harp. <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> too came to <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> to inquire about his needs, but even though he had learned to play the harp, he would have found the skill useless owing to the loss of his eye-sight. </p>
<p id='10.7.4'><b>10.7.4</b> In the third year of the <prn id='Q57337720'>forty-eighth Olympiad</prn> [586 BCE], at which <prn id='Q19720494'>Glaucias</prn> of <pl id='Q13526919'>Crotona</pl> was victorious, the <prn id='Q182875'>Amphictyons</prn> held contests for harping as from the beginning, but added competitions for flute-playing and for singing to the flute. The conquerors proclaimed were <prn id='Q91121884'>Melampus</prn>, a <pl id='Q178488'>Cephallenian</pl>, for harping, and <prn id='Q268229'>Echembrotus</prn>, an <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadian</pl>, for singing to the flute, with <prn id='Q3944390'>Sacadas</prn> of <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl> for flute-playing. This same <prn id='Q3944390'>Sacadas</prn> won victories at the next two <pl id='Q682558'>Pythian</pl> festivals. </p>
<p id='10.7.5'><b>10.7.5</b> On that occasion they also offered for the first time prizes for athletes, the competitions being the same as those at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>, except the tethrippon (four-horse chariot), and the <pl id='Q75459'>Delphians</pl> themselves added to the contests running-races for boys, the dolichos (long course) and the diaulos (double course). At the second <pl id='Q682558'>Pythian</pl> Festival they no longer offered prizes for events, and hereafter gave a crown for victory. On this occasion they no longer included aulodia (singing to the flute), thinking that the music was ill-omened to listen to. For the tunes of the flute were most dismal, and the words sung to the tunes were lamentations. </p>
<p id='10.7.6'><b>10.7.6</b> What I say is confirmed by the votive offering of <prn id='Q268229'>Echembrotus</prn>, a bronze tripod dedicated to the <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> at <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>. The tripod has as its inscription: <br>“<prn id='Q268229'>Echembrotus</prn> of <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl> dedicated this pleasant gift to <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> <br>When he won a victory at the games of the <prn id='Q182875'>Amphictyons</prn>, <br>Singing for the Greeks tunes and lamentations.” <br>In this way the competition in singing to the flute was dropped. But they added a chariot-race, and <prn id='Q207634'>Cleisthenes</prn>, the tyrant of <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl>, was proclaimed victor in the chariot-race. </p>
<p id='10.7.7'><b>10.7.7</b> At the eighth <pl id='Q682558'>Pythian</pl> Festival they added a contest for harpists playing without singing; <prn id='Q12872960'>Agelaus</prn> of <pl id='Q645234'>Tegea</pl> was crowned. At the twenty-third <pl id='Q682558'>Pythian</pl> Festival they added a race in armour. For this <prn id='Q106312441'>Timaenetus</prn> of <pl id='Q1412043'>Phlius</pl> won the laurel, five Olympiads after <prn id='Q20493414'>Damaretus</prn> of <pl id='Q3562285'>Heraea</pl> was victorious [520 BCE]. At the forty-eighth <pl id='Q682558'>Pythian</pl> Festival they established a <pl id='Q106484612'>race</pl> for two-horse chariots, and the chariot won of <prn id='Q91121904'>Execestides</prn> the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocian</pl>. At the fifth Festival after this they yoked foals to a chariot, and the chariot of <prn id='Q91122138'>Orphondas</prn> of <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> came in first. </p>
<p id='10.7.8'><b>10.7.8</b> The pancratium for boys, a <pl id='Q106484612'>race</pl> for a chariot drawn by two foals, and a race for ridden foals, were many years afterwards introduced from <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>. The first was brought in at the sixty-first <pl id='Q682558'>Pythian</pl> Festival, and <prn id='Q91121868'>Iolaidas</prn> of <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> was victorious. At the next Festival but one they held a race for a ridden foal, and at the sixty-ninth Festival a race for a chariot drawn by two foals; the victor proclaimed for the former was <prn id='Q91121883'>Lycormas</prn> of <pl id='Q178405'>Larisa</pl>, for the latter <prn id='Q168261'>Ptolemy</prn> the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonian</pl>. For the kings of <pl id='Q11768'>Egypt</pl> liked to be called <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl>, as in fact they were. The reason why a crown of laurel is the prize for a <pl id='Q682558'>Pythian</pl> victory is in my opinion simply and solely because the prevailing tradition has it that <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> fell in love with the daughter of <pl id='Q1462727'>Ladon</pl>. </p>
<p id='10.8.1'><b>10.8.1</b> Some are of opinion that the assembly of the Greeks that meets at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> was established by <prn id='Q474854'>Amphictyon</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q207715'>Deucalion</prn>, and that the delegates were styled <prn id='Q182875'>Amphictyons</prn> after him. But <prn id='Q514262'>Androtion</prn>, in his <prn id='Q11853325'>Atthis</prn>, says that originally the councillors came to <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> from the neighboring states, that the deputies were styled Amphictions (neighbors), but that as time went on their modern name prevailed. </p>
<p id='10.8.2'><b>10.8.2</b> They say that <prn id='Q474854'>Amphictyon</prn> himself summoned to the common assembly the following tribes of the Greek people: — <prn id='Q465331'>Ionians</prn>, <pl id='Q776988'>Dolopes</pl>, <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessalians</pl>, <pl id='Q4697441'>Aenianians</pl>, <pl id='Q60790367'>Magnesians</pl>, <pl id='Q11934734'>Malians</pl>, <pl id='Q2089144'>Phthiotians</pl>, <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn>, <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl>, <pl id='Q3354839'>Locrians</pl> who border on <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl>, living at the bottom of Mount Cnemis. But when the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> seized the sanctuary, and the war came to an end nine years afterwards, there came a change in the <prn id='Q182875'>Amphictyonic</prn> League. The <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> managed to enter it, while the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocian</pl> nation and a section of the <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn>, namely the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, lost their membership, the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> because of their rash crime, the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> as a penalty for allying themselves with the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl>. </p>
<p id='10.8.3'><b>10.8.3</b> When <prn id='Q314911'>Brennus</prn> led the Gallic army against <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>, no Greeks showed greater zeal for the war than the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl>, and for this conduct of theirs recovered their membership of the League, as well as their old reputation. The emperor <prn id='Q1405'>Augustus</prn> willed that the <pl id='Q943637'>Nicopolitans</pl>, whose city is near <pl id='Q216551'>Actium</pl>, should be members of the <prn id='Q182875'>Amphictyonic</prn> League, that the <pl id='Q60790367'>Magnesians</pl> moreover and the <pl id='Q11934734'>Malians</pl>, together with the <pl id='Q4697441'>Aenianians</pl> and <pl id='Q2089144'>Phthiotians</pl>, should be numbered with the <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessalians</pl>, and that all their votes, together with those of the <pl id='Q776988'>Dolopes</pl>, who were no longer a separate people, should be assigned to the <pl id='Q943637'>Nicopolitans</pl>. </p>

<p id='10.8.6'><b>10.8.6</b> When you enter the city you see temples in a row. The first of them was in ruins, and the one next to it had neither images nor statues. The third had statues of a few Roman emperors; the fourth is called the <pl id='Q12013451'>temple</pl> of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> <prn id='Q106351262'>Forethought</prn>. Of its two images the one in the fore-temple is a votive offering of the <pl id='Q2566850'>Massiliots</pl>, and is larger than the one inside the temple. The <pl id='Q2566850'>Massiliots</pl> are a colony of <pl id='Q428732'>Phocaea</pl> in <pl id='Q620874'>Ionia</pl>, and their city was founded by some of those who ran away from <pl id='Q428732'>Phocaea</pl> when attacked by <prn id='Q462684'>Harpagus</prn> the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl>. They proved superior to the <pl id='Q6343'>Carthaginians</pl> in a sea war, acquired the territory they now hold, and reached great prosperity. </p>
<p id='10.8.7'><b>10.8.7</b> The votive offering of the <pl id='Q2566850'>Massiliots</pl> is of bronze. The gold shield given to <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> <prn id='Q106351262'>Pronoia</prn> (Forethought) by <prn id='Q184462'>Croesus</prn> the <pl id='Q620765'>Lydian</pl> was said by the <pl id='Q75459'>Delphians</pl> to have been stolen by <prn id='Q4484273'>Philomelus</prn>. Near the <pl id='Q12013451'>sanctuary</pl> of <prn id='Q106351262'>Pronoia</prn> is a precinct of the hero <prn id='Q3381822'>Phylacus</prn>. This <prn id='Q3381822'>Phylacus</prn> is reported by the <pl id='Q75459'>Delphians</pl> to have defended them at the time of the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl> invasion. </p>
<p id='10.8.8'><b>10.8.8</b> They say that in the open part of the <pl id='Q22668472'>gymnasium</pl> there once grew a wild wood, and that <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn>, when as the guest of <prn id='Q463107'>Autolycus</prn> he was hunting with the sons of <prn id='Q463107'>Autolycus</prn>, received here from the wild <prn id='Q58697'>boar</prn> the wound above the knee. Turning to the left from the <pl id='Q22668472'>gymnasium</pl> and going down not more, I think, than three stades, you come to a river named <pl id='Q3537166'>Pleistos</pl>. This <pl id='Q3537166'>Pleistos</pl> descends to <pl id='Q56754242'>Cirrha</pl>, the port of <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>, and flows into the sea there. </p>
<p id='10.8.9'><b>10.8.9</b> Ascending from the <pl id='Q22668472'>gymnasium</pl> along the way to the sanctuary you reach, on the right of the way, the water of <pl id='Q152348'>Castalia</pl>, which is sweet to drink and pleasant to bathe in. Some say that the spring was named after a native woman, others after a man called <prn id='Q56936702'>Castalius</prn>. But <prn id='Q983680'>Panyassis</prn>, son of <prn id='Q106351469'>Polyarchus</prn>, who composed an epic poem on <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, says that <prn id='Q170053'>Castalia</prn> was a daughter of <pl id='Q203923'>Achelous</pl>. For about <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> he says: “Crossing with swift feet snowy <pl id='Q105261'>Parnassus</pl> he reached the immortal water of <pl id='Q152348'>Castalia</pl>, daughter of <prn id='Q391379'>Achelous</prn>.” </p>
<p id='10.8.10'><b>10.8.10</b> I have heard another account, that the water was a gift to <prn id='Q170053'>Castalia</prn> from the river <pl id='Q1235405'>Cephisus</pl>. So <prn id='Q212872'>Alcaeus</prn> has it in his prelude to <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>. The strongest confirmation of this view is a custom of the <pl id='Q1267602'>Lilaeans</pl>, who on certain specified days throw into the spring of the <pl id='Q1235405'>Cephisus</pl> cakes of the district and other things ordained by use, and it is said that these reappear in <pl id='Q152348'>Castalia</pl>. </p>
<p id='10.9.1'><b>10.9.1</b> The city of <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>, both the sacred enclosure of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> and the city generally, lies altogether on sloping ground. The enclosure is very large, and is on the highest part of the city. Passages run through it, close to one another. I will mention which of the votive offerings seemed to me most worthy of notice. </p>
<p id='10.9.2'><b>10.9.2</b> The athletes and competitors in music that the majority of mankind have neglected, are, I think, scarcely worthy of serious attention; and the athletes who have left a reputation behind them I have set forth in my account of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>. There is a statue at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> of <prn id='Q16555097'>Phaylus</prn> of <pl id='Q13526919'>Crotona</pl>. He won no victory at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>, but his victories at <pl id='Q682558'>Pytho</pl> were two in the pentathlum and one in the foot-race. He also fought at sea against the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl>, in a ship of his own, equipped by himself and manned by citizens of <pl id='Q13526919'>Crotona</pl> who were staying in Greece. </p>
<p id='10.9.3'><b>10.9.3</b> Such is the story of the athlete of <pl id='Q13526919'>Crotona</pl>. On entering the enclosure you come to a bronze <prn id='Q693690'>bull</prn>, a votive offering of the <pl id='Q3693378'>Corcyraeans</pl> made by <prn id='Q11951544'>Theopropus</prn> of <pl id='Q191082'>Aegina</pl>. The story is that in <pl id='Q3693378'>Corcyra</pl> a <prn id='Q693690'>bull</prn>, leaving the <prn id='Q830'>cows</prn>, would go down from the pasture and bellow on the shore. As the same thing happened every day, the herdsman went down to the sea and saw a countless number of <prn id='Q2346039'>tunny</prn>-fish. </p>
<p id='10.9.4'><b>10.9.4</b> He reported the matter to the <pl id='Q3693378'>Corcyraeans</pl>, who, finding their labour lost in trying to catch the <prn id='Q2346039'>tunnies</prn>, sent envoys to <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>. So they sacrificed the <prn id='Q693690'>bull</prn> to <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, and straightway after the sacrifice they caught the fish, and dedicated their offerings at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> and at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> with a tithe of their catch. </p>
<p id='10.9.5'><b>10.9.5</b> Next to this are offerings of the <pl id='Q645234'>Tegeans</pl> from spoils of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>: an <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, a <prn id='Q165023'>Victory</prn>, the heroes of the country, <prn id='Q203673'>Callisto</prn>, daughter of <prn id='Q501667'>Lycaon</prn>, <prn id='Q606422'>Arcas</prn>, who gave <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl> its name, <prn id='Q1325009'>Elatus</prn>, <prn id='Q3606201'>Apheidas</prn>, and <prn id='Q793560'>Azan</prn>, the sons of <prn id='Q606422'>Arcas</prn>, and also <prn id='Q12760231'>Triphylus</prn>. The mother of this <prn id='Q12760231'>Triphylus</prn> was not <prn id='Q782764'>Erato</prn>, but <prn id='Q1805698'>Laodameia</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q482039'>Amyclas</prn>, king of <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl>. There is also a statue dedicated of <prn id='Q52791788'>Erasus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q12760231'>Triphylus</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.9.6'><b>10.9.6</b> They who made the images are as follows: The <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> and <prn id='Q203673'>Callisto</prn> were made by <prn id='Q15623054'>Pausanias</prn> of <pl id='Q505703'>Apollonia</pl>; the <prn id='Q165023'>Victory</prn> and the likeness of <prn id='Q606422'>Arcas</prn> by <prn id='Q3704612'>Daedalus</prn> of <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl>; <prn id='Q12760231'>Triphylus</prn> and <prn id='Q793560'>Azan</prn> by <prn id='Q11946843'>Samolas</prn> the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadian</pl>; <prn id='Q1325009'>Elatus</prn>, <prn id='Q3606201'>Apheidas</prn> and <prn id='Q52791788'>Erasus</prn> by <prn id='Q4775095'>Antiphanes</prn> of <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>. These offerings were sent by the <pl id='Q645234'>Tegeans</pl> to <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> after they took prisoners the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> that attacked their city. </p>
<p id='10.9.7'><b>10.9.7</b> Opposite these are offerings of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> from spoils of the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>: the <prn id='Q190103'>Dioscuri</prn>, <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, and beside these <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, <prn id='Q143559'>Lysander</prn>, son of <prn id='Q56558632'>Aristocritus</prn>, represented as being crowned by <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, <prn id='Q393647'>Agias</prn>, soothsayer to <prn id='Q143559'>Lysander</prn> on the occasion of his victory, and <prn id='Q106344932'>Hermon</prn>, who steered his flag-ship. </p>
<p id='10.9.8'><b>10.9.8</b> This statue of <prn id='Q106344932'>Hermon</prn> was not unnaturally made by <prn id='Q15445359'>Theocosmus</prn> of <pl id='Q42307600'>Megara</pl>, who had been enrolled as a citizen of that city. The <prn id='Q190103'>Dioscuri</prn> were made by <prn id='Q4775095'>Antiphanes</prn> of <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>; the soothsayer by <prn id='Q11941745'>Pison</prn>, from <pl id='Q1443132'>Calaureia</pl>, in the territory of <pl id='Q581494'>Troezen</pl>; the <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> and also <prn id='Q143559'>Lysander</prn> by <prn id='Q11916525'>Dameas</prn>; the <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> and <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> by <prn id='Q11907116'>Athenodorus</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.9.9'><b>10.9.9</b> The last two artists were <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> from <pl id='Q2537130'>Cleitor</pl>.

<p id='10.9.11'><b>10.9.11</b> The <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> refuse to confess that their defeat at <pl id='Q404513'>Aegospotami</pl> was fairly inflicted, maintaining that they were betrayed by <prn id='Q250506'>Tydeus</prn> and <prn id='Q353570'>Adeimantus</prn>, their generals, who had been bribed, they say, with money by <prn id='Q143559'>Lysander</prn>.

<p id='10.9.12'><b>10.9.12</b> So much for this belief.

Between <prn id='Q208256'>Diomedes</prn> and <prn id='Q10966726'>Aegialeus</prn> is <prn id='Q1378407'>Euryalus</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.10.5'><b>10.10.5</b> Opposite them are other statues, dedicated by the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> who helped the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> under <prn id='Q190436'>Epaminondas</prn> to found <pl id='Q1022117'>Messene</pl>.

<p id='10.10.6'><b>10.10.6</b> The bronze <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn> and captive women dedicated by the <pl id='Q3981082'>Tarentines</pl> were made from spoils taken from the <pl id='Q737684'>Messapians</pl>, a non-Greek people bordering on the territory of <pl id='Q3981082'>Tarentum</pl>, and are works of <prn id='Q452536'>Ageladas</prn> the <pl id='Q13533353'>Argive</pl>. <pl id='Q3981082'>Tarentum</pl> is a colony of the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, and its founder was <prn id='Q1969790'>Phalanthus</prn>, a <pl id='Q5690'>Spartan</pl>. On setting out to found a colony <prn id='Q1969790'>Phalanthus</prn> received an oracle from <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>, declaring that when he should feel rain under a cloudless sky (aethra), he would then win both a territory and a city. </p>
<p id='10.10.7'><b>10.10.7</b> At first he neither examined the oracle himself nor informed one of his interpreters, but came to <pl id='Q913582'>Italy</pl> with his ships. But when, although he won victories over the barbarians, he succeeded neither in taking a city nor in making himself master of a territory, he called to mind the oracle, and thought that the god had foretold an impossibility. For never could rain fall from a clear and cloudless sky. When he was in despair, his wife, who had accompanied him from home, among other endearments placed her husband's head between her knees and began to pick out the lice. And it chanced that the wife, such was her affection, wept as she saw her husband's fortunes coming to nothing. </p>
<p id='10.10.8'><b>10.10.8</b> As her tears fell in showers, and she wetted the head of <prn id='Q1969790'>Phalanthus</prn>, he realized the meaning of the oracle, for his wife's name was <prn id='Q3733767'>Aethra</prn>. And so on that night he took from the barbarians <pl id='Q3981082'>Tarentum</pl>, the largest and most prosperous city on the coast. They say that <prn id='Q2167123'>Taras</prn> the hero was a son of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> by a nymph of the country, and that after this hero were named both the city and the river. For the river, just like the city, is called <pl id='Q3981082'>Taras</pl>. </p>
<p id='10.11.1'><b>10.11.1</b> Near the votive offering of the <pl id='Q3981082'>Tarentines</pl> is a <pl id='Q22810175'>treasury</pl> of the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl>, but there is no treasure to be seen either here or in any other of the treasuries. The <pl id='Q690575'>Cnidians</pl> brought the following images to <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>: <prn id='Q2632716'>Triopas</prn>, founder of <pl id='Q690575'>Cnidus</pl>, standing by a <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn>, <prn id='Q103107'>Leto</prn>, and <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> and <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> shooting arrows at <prn id='Q656887'>Tityos</prn>, who has already been wounded in the body. </p>
<p id='10.11.2'><b>10.11.2</b> These stand by the <pl id='Q22810175'>treasury of the Sicyonians</pl>. The <pl id='Q95452882'>Siphnians</pl> too made a <pl id='Q1754028'>treasury</pl>, the reason being as follows. Their island contained gold mines, and the god ordered them to pay a tithe of the revenues to <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>. So they built the treasury, and continued to pay the tithe until greed made them omit the tribute, when the sea flooded their mines and hid them from sight. </p>
<p id='10.11.3'><b>10.11.3</b> The people of <pl id='Q58878895'>Lipara</pl> too dedicated statues to commemorate a naval victory over the <pl id='Q206730'>Tyrrhenians</pl>. These people were colonists from <pl id='Q690575'>Cnidus</pl>, and the leader of the colony is said to have been a <pl id='Q690575'>Cnidian</pl>, whose name was <prn id='Q19660974'>Pentathlus</prn> according to a statement made by the <pl id='Q4420718'>Syracusan</pl> <prn id='Q580661'>Antiochus</prn>, son of Xenophanes1, in his History of Sicily. He says also that they built a city on Cape <pl id='Q1034750'>Pachynum</pl> in <pl id='Q4951156'>Sicily</pl>, but were hard pressed in a war with the <prn id='Q931423'>Elymi</prn> and <pl id='Q41642'>Phoenicians</pl>, and driven out, but occupied the islands, from which they expelled the inhabitants if they were not still uninhabited, still called, as they are called by <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>, the <pl id='Q179883'>islands</pl> of <prn id='Q172549'>Aeolus</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.11.4'><b>10.11.4</b> Of these <pl id='Q179883'>islands</pl> they dwell in <pl id='Q58878895'>Lipara</pl>, on which they built a city, but <pl id='Q207323'>Hiera</pl>, <pl id='Q131148'>Strongyle</pl> and <pl id='Q505847'>Didymae</pl> they cultivate, crossing to them in ships. On <pl id='Q131148'>Strongyle</pl> fire is to be seen rising out of the ground, while in <pl id='Q207323'>Hiera</pl> fire of its own accord bursts out on the summit of the island, and by the sea are baths, comfortable enough if the water receive you kindly, but if not, painful to enter because of the heat. </p>
<p id='10.11.5'><b>10.11.5</b> The <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> have a treasury built from the spoils of war, and <pl id='Q478011'>so have</pl> the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>. Whether the <pl id='Q690575'>Cnidians</pl> built to commemorate a victory or to display their prosperity I do not know, but the <pl id='Q11225429'>Theban</pl> treasury was made from the spoils taken at the battle of <pl id='Q2606004'>Leuctra</pl>, and the <pl id='Q478011'>Athenian treasury</pl> from those taken from the army that landed with <prn id='Q41328'>Datis</prn> at <pl id='Q31900'>Marathon</pl>. The inhabitants of <pl id='Q1774167'>Cleonae</pl> were, like the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl>, afflicted with the <prn id='Q758173'>plague</prn>, and obeying an oracle from <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> sacrificed a he-<prn id='Q2934'>goat</prn> to the sun while it was still rising. This put an end to the trouble, and so they sent a bronze he-<prn id='Q2934'>goat</prn> to <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>. The <pl id='Q4420718'>Syracusans</pl> have a treasury built from the spoils taken in the great <pl id='Q122443'>Attic</pl> disaster, the <pl id='Q999468'>Potidaeans</pl> in <pl id='Q41741'>Thrace</pl> built one to show their piety to the god. </p>
<p id='10.11.6'><b>10.11.6</b> The <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> also built a stoa out of the spoils they took in their war against the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesians</pl> and their Greek allies. There are also dedicated the figure-heads of ships and bronze shields. The inscription on them enumerates the cities from which the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> sent the first-fruits: <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl>, <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl>, <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl>, <pl id='Q42307600'>Megara</pl>, <pl id='Q2068130'>Pellene</pl> in <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaia</pl>, <pl id='Q661559'>Ambracia</pl>, <pl id='Q190138'>Leucas</pl>, and <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl> itself. It also says that from the spoils taken in these sea-battles a sacrifice was offered to <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> and to <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> at the cape called <pl id='Q24990480'>Rhium</pl>. It seems to me that the inscription refers to <prn id='Q2338787'>Phormio</prn>, son of <prn id='Q123190357'>Asopichus</prn>, and to his achievements. </p>
<p id='10.12.1'><b>10.12.1</b> There is a rock rising up above the ground. On it, say the <pl id='Q75459'>Delphians</pl>, there stood and chanted the oracles a woman, by name <prn id='Q1544642'>Herophile</prn> and surnamed <prn id='Q587457'>Sibyl</prn>. The former <prn id='Q587457'>Sibyl</prn> I find was as ancient as any; the Greeks say that she was a daughter of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> by <prn id='Q22906256'>Lamia</prn>, daughter of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, that she was the first woman to chant oracles, and that the name <prn id='Q587457'>Sibyl</prn> was given her by the <pl id='Q2370577'>Libyans</pl>. </p>
<p id='10.12.2'><b>10.12.2</b> <prn id='Q1544642'>Herophile</prn> was younger than she was, but nevertheless she too was clearly born before the <prn id='Q42937'>Trojan War</prn>, as she foretold in her oracles that <prn id='Q164061'>Helen</prn> would be brought up in <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl> to be the ruin of <prn id='Q48'>Asia</prn> and of Europe, and that for her sake the Greeks would capture <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl>. The <pl id='Q173148'>Delians</pl> remember also a hymn this woman composed to <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>. In her poem she calls herself not only <prn id='Q1544642'>Herophile</prn> but also <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, and the wedded wife of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, saying too sometimes that she is his sister, and sometimes that she is his daughter. </p>
<p id='10.12.3'><b>10.12.3</b> These statements she made in her poetry when in a frenzy and possessed by the god. Elsewhere in her oracles she states that her mother was an immortal, one of the nymphs of <pl id='Q1127771'>Ida</pl>, while her father was a human. These are the verses: “I am by birth half mortal, half divine; An immortal nymph was my mother, my father an eater of corn; On my mother's side of <pl id='Q1127771'>Idaean</pl> birth, but my fatherland was red <pl id='Q1670784'>Marpessus</pl>, sacred to the <prn id='Q334486'>Mother</prn>, and the river Aedoneus. </p>
<p id='10.12.4'><b>10.12.4</b> Even today there remain on <pl id='Q22647'>Trojan</pl> <pl id='Q1127771'>Ida</pl> the ruins of the city <pl id='Q1670784'>Marpessus</pl>, with some sixty inhabitants. All the land around <pl id='Q1670784'>Marpessus</pl> is reddish and terribly parched, so that the light and porous nature of <pl id='Q1127771'>Ida</pl> in this place is in my opinion the reason why the river Aedoneus sinks into the ground, rises to sink once more, finally disappearing altogether beneath the earth. <pl id='Q1670784'>Marpessus</pl> is two hundred and forty stades distant from <pl id='Q1393407'>Alexandria</pl> in the <pl id='Q2454671'>Troad</pl>. </p>
<p id='10.12.5'><b>10.12.5</b> The inhabitants of this <pl id='Q1393407'>Alexandria</pl> say that <prn id='Q1544642'>Herophile</prn> became the attendant of the temple of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> <prn id='Q119155'>Smintheus</prn>, and that on the occasion of <prn id='Q193433'>Hecuba</prn>'s dream she uttered the prophecy which we know was actually fulfilled. This <prn id='Q12737222'>Sibyl</prn> passed the greater part of her life in <pl id='Q13580795'>Samos</pl>, but she also visited <pl id='Q1933754'>Clarus</pl> in the territory of <pl id='Q1142488'>Colophon</pl>, <pl id='Q173148'>Delos</pl> and <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>. Whenever she visited <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>, she would stand on this rock and sing her chants. </p>
<p id='10.12.6'><b>10.12.6</b> However, death came upon her in the <pl id='Q2454671'>Troad</pl>, and her tomb is in the grove of the <pl id='Q65072495'>Sminthian</pl> with these elegiac verses inscribed upon the tomb-stone: <br>“Here I am, the plain-speaking <prn id='Q12737222'>Sibyl</prn> of <prn id='Q3382132'>Phoebus</prn>, <br>Hidden beneath this stone tomb. <br>A maiden once gifted with voice, but now for ever voiceless, <br>By hard fate doomed to this fetter. <br>But I am buried near the nymphs and this <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn>, <br>Enjoying in the world below a part of the kingdom I had then.” <br>The <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> stands by the side of the tomb, a square-shaped figure of stone. On the left is water running down into a well, and the images of the nymphs. </p>
<p id='10.12.7'><b>10.12.7</b> The <pl id='Q723091'>Erythraeans</pl>, who are more eager than any other Greeks to lay claim to <prn id='Q1544642'>Herophile</prn>, adduce as evidence a mountain called Mount <pl id='Q31515083'>Corycus</pl> with a cave in it, saying that <prn id='Q1544642'>Herophile</prn> was born in it, and that she was a daughter of <prn id='Q91109230'>Theodorus</prn>, a shepherd of the district, and of a nymph. They add that the surname <pl id='Q1127771'>Idaean</pl> was given to the nymph simply because the men of those days called <i>idai</i> places that were thickly wooded. The verse about <pl id='Q1670784'>Marpessus</pl> and the river Aedoneus is cut out of the oracles by the <pl id='Q723091'>Erythraeans</pl>. </p>
<p id='10.12.8'><b>10.12.8</b> The next woman to give oracles in the same way, according to <prn id='Q3144436'>Hyperochus</prn> of <pl id='Q243456'>Cumae</pl>, a historian, was called <prn id='Q59772819'>Demo</prn>, and came from <pl id='Q243456'>Cumae</pl> in the territory of the <prn id='Q3884171'>Opici</prn>. The <pl id='Q243456'>Cumaeans</pl> can point to no oracle given by this woman, but they show a small stone urn in a sanctuary of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, in which they say are placed the bones of the <prn id='Q762835'>Sibyl</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.12.9'><b>10.12.9</b> Later than <prn id='Q59772819'>Demo</prn> there grew up among the <prn id='Q7325'>Hebrews</prn> above <pl id='Q23792'>Palestine</pl> a woman who gave oracles and was named <prn id='Q539123'>Sabbe</prn>. They say that the father of <prn id='Q539123'>Sabbe</prn> was <prn id='Q312425'>Berosus</prn>, and her mother <prn id='Q16331991'>Erymanthe</prn>. But some call her a <pl id='Q5684'>Babylonian</pl> <prn id='Q539123'>Sibyl</prn>, others an <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptian</pl>. </p>
<p id='10.12.10'><b>10.12.10</b> <prn id='Q91111186'>Phaennis</prn>, daughter of a king of the <pl id='Q1435268'>Chaonians</pl>, and the <prn id='Q2524852'>Peleiae</prn> (Doves) at <pl id='Q382317'>Dodona</pl> also gave oracles under the inspiration of a god, but they were not called by men <prn id='Q12737222'>Sibyls</prn>. To learn the date of <prn id='Q91111186'>Phaennis</prn> and to read her oracles . . . for <prn id='Q91111186'>Phaennis</prn> was born when <prn id='Q211488'>Antiochus</prn> was establishing his kingship immediately after the capture of <prn id='Q59734'>Demetrius</prn>. The <prn id='Q2524852'>Peleiades</prn> are said to have been born still earlier than <prn id='Q2993240'>Phemonoe</prn>, and to have been the first women to chant these verses: “<prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> was, <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> is, <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> shall be; O mighty <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>. <prn id='Q93172'>Earth</prn> sends up the harvest, therefore sing the praise of earth as Mother.” </p>
<p id='10.12.11'><b>10.12.11</b> It is said that the men who uttered oracles were <prn id='Q91121913'>Euclus</prn> of <pl id='Q644636'>Cyprus</pl>, the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> <prn id='Q728059'>Musaeus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q91178752'>Antiophemus</prn>, and <prn id='Q1200671'>Lycus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q1076578'>Pandion</prn>, and also <prn id='Q708459'>Bacis</prn>, a <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotian</pl> who was possessed by nymphs. I have read the oracles of all these except those of <prn id='Q1200671'>Lycus</prn>. These are the women and men who, down to the present day, are said to have been the mouthpiece by which a god prophesied. But time is long, and perhaps similar things may occur again. </p>
<p id='10.13.1'><b>10.13.1</b> A bronze head of the <pl id='Q249561'>Paeonian</pl> <prn id='Q693690'>bull</prn> called the bison was sent to <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> by the <pl id='Q249561'>Paeonian</pl> king <prn id='Q5308451'>Dropion</prn>, son of <prn id='Q6524969'>Leon</prn>. These bisons are the most difficult beasts to capture alive, and no nets could be made strong enough to hold out against their rush. They are hunted in the following manner. When the hunters have found a place sinking to a hollow, they first strengthen it all round with a stout fence, and then they cover the slope and the level part at the end with fresh skins, or, if they should chance to be without skins, they make dry hides slippery with olive oil. </p>
<p id='10.13.2'><b>10.13.2</b> Next their best riders drive the bisons together into the place I have described. These at once slip on the first skins and roll down the slope until they reach the level ground, where at the first they are left to lie. On about the fourth or fifth day, when the beasts have lost most of their spirit through hunger and distress, </p>
<p id='10.13.3'><b>10.13.3</b> those of the hunters who are professional tamers bring to them as they lie fruit of the cultivated pine, first peeling off the inner husk; for the moment the beasts would touch no other food. Finally they tie ropes round them and lead them off. </p>
<p id='10.13.4'><b>10.13.4</b> This is the way in which the bisons are caught. Opposite the bronze head of the bison is a statue of a man wearing a breastplate, on which is a cloak. The <pl id='Q75459'>Delphians</pl> say that it is an offering of the <pl id='Q62944263'>Andrians</pl>, and a portrait of A241, their founder. The images of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, and <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> were dedicated by the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> from the spoils taken from the <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessalians</pl>, their enemies always, who are their neighbors except where the Epicnemidian Locrians come between. </p>
<p id='10.13.5'><b>10.13.5</b> The <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessalians</pl> too of <pl id='Q38281085'>Pharsalus</pl> dedicated an <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn> on horseback, with <prn id='Q186271'>Patroclus</prn> running beside his <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn>; the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> living in <pl id='Q9207638'>Dium</pl>, a city at the foot of Mount <pl id='Q7800388'>Pieria</pl>, the <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> who has taken hold of the deer; the people of <pl id='Q44112'>Cyrene</pl>, a Greek city in <pl id='Q2370577'>Libya</pl>, the chariot with an image of <prn id='Q3575327'>Ammon</prn> in it.

Whereupon <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> took up the <prn id='Q106417910'>tripod</prn> and carried it out of the <pl id='Q10751359'>temple</pl>. Then the prophetess said: “Then there was another <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, of <pl id='Q217379'>Tiryns</pl>, not the <pl id='Q1145180'>Canopian</pl>.” For before this the <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptian</pl> <prn id='Q91109410'>Heracles</prn> had visited <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>. On the occasion to which I refer the son of <prn id='Q206214'>Amphitryon</prn> restored the tripod to <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, and was told by <prn id='Q12882028'>Xenocleia</prn> all he wished to know. The poets adopted the story, and sing about a fight between <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> and <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> for a tripod. </p>
<p id='10.13.9'><b>10.13.9</b> The Greeks in common dedicated from the spoils taken at the battle of <pl id='Q204636'>Plataea</pl> a gold tripod set on a bronze <prn id='Q2102'>serpent</prn>.

<p id='10.14.1'><b>10.14.1</b> The axes were dedicated by <prn id='Q106351551'>Periclytus</prn>, son of EuthymachYY, a man of <pl id='Q211817'>Tenedos</pl>, and allude to an old story. <prn id='Q1066344'>Cycnus</prn>, they say, was a son of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, and ruled as king in <pl id='Q6427503'>Colonae</pl>, a city in the <pl id='Q2454671'>Troad</pl> situated opposite the island LeucophryYY. </p>
<p id='10.14.2'><b>10.14.2</b> He had a daughter, by name <prn id='Q256115'>Hemithea</prn>, and a son, called <prn id='Q426788'>Tennes</prn>, by <prn id='Q3922437'>Procleia</prn>, who was a daughter of <prn id='Q2980449'>Clytius</prn> and a sister of <prn id='Q304525'>Caletor</prn>. <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> in the <prn id='Q8275'>Iliad</prn> says that this <prn id='Q304525'>Caletor</prn>, as he was putting the fire under the ship of <prn id='Q871361'>Protesilaus</prn>, was killed by <prn id='Q172725'>Ajax</prn>. <prn id='Q3922437'>Procleia</prn> died before <prn id='Q1066344'>Cycnus</prn>, and his second wife, <prn id='Q5862013'>Philonome</prn>, daughter of <prn id='Q7832603'>Cragasus</prn>, fell in love with <prn id='Q426788'>Tennes</prn>. Rejected by him she falsely accused him before her husband, saying that he had made love to her, and she had rejected him. <prn id='Q1066344'>Cycnus</prn> was deceived by the trick, placed <prn id='Q426788'>Tennes</prn> with his sister in a chest and launched it out to sea. </p>
<p id='10.14.3'><b>10.14.3</b> The young people came safely to the island LeucophryYY, and the island was given its present name from <prn id='Q426788'>Tennes</prn>. <prn id='Q1066344'>Cycnus</prn>, however, was not to remain for ever ignorant of the trick, and sailed to his son to confess his ignorance and to ask for pardon for his mistake. He put in at the island and fastened the cables of his ship to something — a rock or a tree — but <prn id='Q426788'>Tennes</prn> in a passion cut them adrift with an axe. </p>
<p id='10.14.4'><b>10.14.4</b> For this reason a by-word has arisen, which is used of those who make a stern refusal: “So and so has cut whatever it may be with an axe of <pl id='Q211817'>Tenedos</pl>.” The Greeks say that while <prn id='Q426788'>Tennes</prn> was defending his country he was killed by <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn>. In course of time weakness compelled the people of <pl id='Q211817'>Tenedos</pl> to merge themselves with the <pl id='Q1393407'>Alexandrians</pl> on the <pl id='Q2454671'>Troad</pl> mainland. </p>
<p id='10.14.5'><b>10.14.5</b> The Greeks who fought against the king, besides dedicating at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl> a bronze <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, dedicated also an <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>, from spoils taken in the naval actions at <pl id='Q105317807'>Artemisium</pl> and <pl id='Q178850'>Salamis</pl>. There is also a story that <prn id='Q179552'>Themistocles</prn> came to <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> bringing with him for <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> some of the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl> spoils. He asked whether he should dedicate them within the <pl id='Q10751359'>temple</pl>, but the <prn id='Q220344'>Pythian priestess</prn> bade him carry them from the sanctuary altogether. The part of the oracle referring to this runs as follows: <br>“The splendid beauty of the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl>'s spoils <br>Set not within my temple. Despatch them home speedily.” </p>
<p id='10.14.6'><b>10.14.6</b> Now I greatly marveled that it was from <prn id='Q179552'>Themistocles</prn> alone that the priestess refused to accept <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl> spoils. Some thought that the god would have rejected alike all offerings from <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl> spoils, if like <prn id='Q179552'>Themistocles</prn> the others had inquired of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> before making their dedication. Others said that the god knew that <prn id='Q179552'>Themistocles</prn> would become a suppliant of the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl> king, and refused to take the gifts so that <prn id='Q179552'>Themistocles</prn> might not by a dedication render the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl>'s enmity unappeasable. The expedition of the barbarian against Greece we find foretold in the oracles of <prn id='Q708459'>Bacis</prn>, and <prn id='Q91121913'>Euclus</prn> wrote his verses about it at an even earlier date. </p>
<p id='10.14.7'><b>10.14.7</b> Near the great altar is a bronze <prn id='Q18498'>wolf</prn>, an offering of the <pl id='Q75459'>Delphians</pl> themselves. They say that a fellow robbed the god of some treasure, and kept himself and the gold hidden at the place on Mount <pl id='Q105261'>Parnassus</pl> where the forest is thickest. As he slept a <prn id='Q18498'>wolf</prn> attacked and killed him, and every day went to the city and howled. When the people began to realize that the matter was not without the direction of heaven, they followed the beast and found the sacred gold. So to the god they dedicated a bronze <prn id='Q18498'>wolf</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.15.1'><b>10.15.1</b> A gilt statue of <prn id='Q232790'>Phryne</prn> was made by <prn id='Q105290'>Praxiteles</prn>, one of her lovers, but it was <prn id='Q232790'>Phryne</prn> herself who dedicated the statue. The offerings next to <prn id='Q232790'>Phryne</prn> include two images of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, one dedicated from <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl> spoils by the <pl id='Q233576'>Epidaurians</pl> of <pl id='Q12649101'>Argolis</pl>, the other dedicated by the <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarians</pl> to commemorate a victory over the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> at <pl id='Q2537089'>Nisaea</pl>. The <pl id='Q742538'>Plataeans</pl> have dedicated an <prn id='Q473194'>ox</prn>, an offering made at the time when, in their own territory, they took part, along with the other Greeks, in the defence against <prn id='Q155063'>Mardonius</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q454695'>Gobryas</prn>. Then there are another two images of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, one dedicated by the citizens of <pl id='Q302511'>Heracleia</pl> on the <pl id='Q621672'>Euxine</pl>, the other by the <prn id='Q182875'>Amphictyons</prn> when they fined the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> for tilling the territory of the god. </p>
<p id='10.15.2'><b>10.15.2</b> The second <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> the <pl id='Q75459'>Delphians</pl> call SitalcasYY, and he is thirty-five cubits high.

<p id='10.15.4'><b>10.15.4</b> Statues of cavalry leaders, mounted on <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn>, were dedicated in <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>'s sanctuary by the <pl id='Q1330631'>Pheraeans</pl> after routing the <pl id='Q122443'>Attic</pl> cavalry. The bronze palm-tree, as well as a gilt image of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> on it, was dedicated by the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> from the spoils they took in their two successes on the same day at the <pl id='Q385473'>Eurymedon</pl>, one on land, and the other with their fleet on the river.

<p id='10.15.5'><b>10.15.5</b> I myself put the blame on rogues and thieves.

<p id='10.15.6'><b>10.15.6</b> <prn id='Q2482150'>Cleitodemus</prn> describes other omens that told the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> to beware of sailing against <pl id='Q4951156'>Sicily</pl>. The <pl id='Q44112'>Cyrenaeans</pl> have dedicated at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> a figure of <prn id='Q409834'>Battus</prn> in a chariot; he it was who brought them in ships from <pl id='Q433004'>Thera</pl> to <pl id='Q2370577'>Libya</pl>.

<p id='10.15.7'><b>10.15.7</b> It is said that, after <prn id='Q409834'>Battus</prn> had founded <pl id='Q44112'>Cyrene</pl>, he was cured of his stammering in the following way.

<p id='10.16.2'><b>10.16.2</b> The shape of the stand is very like that of a tower, wider at the bottom and rising to a narrow top. Each side of the stand is not solid throughout, but the iron cross-strips are placed like the rungs of a ladder. The upright iron plates are turned outwards at the top, so forming a seat for the bowl. </p>

<p id='10.16.5'><b>10.16.5</b> On the mountains of <pl id='Q4752820'>Crete</pl> there is still in my time a city called <pl id='Q3561249'>Elyrus</pl>.

The <pl id='Q13554032'>Carystians</pl> and the <pl id='Q742538'>Plataeans</pl> dedicated <prn id='Q473194'>oxen</prn>, I believe, because, having repulsed the barbarian, they had won a secure prosperity, and especially a land free to plough. The <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolian</pl> nation, having subdued their neighbors the <pl id='Q416070'>Acarnanians</pl>, sent statues of generals and images of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> and <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.16.7'><b>10.16.7</b> I learnt a very strange thing that happened to the <pl id='Q58878895'>Liparaeans</pl> in a war with the <pl id='Q206730'>Etruscans</pl>. For the <pl id='Q58878895'>Liparaeans</pl> were bidden by the <prn id='Q220344'>Pythian priestess</prn> to engage the <pl id='Q206730'>Etruscans</pl> with the fewest possible ships. So they put out against the <pl id='Q206730'>Etruscans</pl> with five triremes. Their enemies, refusing to admit that their seamanship was unequal to that of the <pl id='Q58878895'>Liparaeans</pl>, went out to meet them with an equal number of ships. These the <pl id='Q58878895'>Liparaeans</pl> captured, as they did a second five that came out against them, overcoming too a third squadron of five, and likewise a fourth. So they dedicated at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> images of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> equal in number to the ships that they had captured. </p>
<p id='10.16.8'><b>10.16.8</b> <prn id='Q91121081'>Echecratides</prn> of <pl id='Q178405'>Larisa</pl> dedicated the small <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, said by the <pl id='Q75459'>Delphians</pl> to have been the very first offering to be set up. </p>
<p id='10.17.1'><b>10.17.1</b> Of the non-Greeks in the west, the people of <pl id='Q3760293'>Sardinia</pl> have sent a bronze statue of him after whom they are called. In size and prosperity <pl id='Q3760293'>Sardinia</pl> is the equal of the most celebrated islands. What the ancient name was that the natives give it I do not know, but those of the Greeks who sailed there to trade called it Ichnussa, because the shape of the island is very like a man's footprint (ichnos). Its length is one thousand one hundred and twenty stades, and its breadth extends to four hundred and twenty. </p>
<p id='10.17.2'><b>10.17.2</b> The first sailors to cross to the island are said to have been <pl id='Q2370577'>Libyans</pl>. Their leader was <prn id='Q1276974'>Sardus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q106312146'>Maceris</prn>, the <prn id='Q106312146'>Maceris</prn> surnamed <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> by the <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptians</pl> and <pl id='Q2370577'>Libyans</pl>. <prn id='Q106312146'>Maceris</prn> himself was celebrated chiefly for his journey to <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>, but <prn id='Q1276974'>Sardus</prn> it was who led the <pl id='Q2370577'>Libyans</pl> to Ichnussa, and after him the island was renamed. However, the Libyan army did not expel the aboriginals, who received the invaders as settlers through compulsion rather than in goodwill. Neither the <pl id='Q2370577'>Libyans</pl> nor the native population knew how to build cities. They dwelt in scattered groups, where chance found them a home in cabins or caves. </p>
<p id='10.17.3'><b>10.17.3</b> Years after the <pl id='Q2370577'>Libyans</pl>, there came to the island from Greece <prn id='Q392435'>Aristaeus</prn> and his followers. <prn id='Q392435'>Aristaeus</prn> is said to have been a son of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> and <pl id='Q44112'>Cyrene</pl>, and they say that, deeply grieved by the fate of <prn id='Q208531'>Actaeon</prn>, and vexed alike with <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl> and the whole of Greece, he migrated to <pl id='Q3760293'>Sardinia</pl>. </p>
<p id='10.17.4'><b>10.17.4</b> Others think that <prn id='Q134756'>Daedalus</prn> too ran away from <prn id='Q500454'>Camicus</prn> [ms corrupt] on this occasion, because of the invasion of the <pl id='Q4752820'>Cretans</pl>, and took a part in the colony that <prn id='Q392435'>Aristaeus</prn> led to <pl id='Q3760293'>Sardinia</pl>. But it is nonsense to think that <prn id='Q134756'>Daedalus</prn>, a contemporary of <prn id='Q130890'>Oedipus</prn>, king of <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>, had a part in a colony or anything else along with <prn id='Q392435'>Aristaeus</prn>, who married <prn id='Q94072'>Autonoe</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q27613'>Cadmus</prn>. At any rate, these colonists too founded no city, the reason being, I think, that neither in numbers nor in strength were they capable of the task. </p>
<p id='10.17.5'><b>10.17.5</b> After <prn id='Q392435'>Aristaeus</prn> the <pl id='Q1203967'>Iberians</pl> crossed to <pl id='Q3760293'>Sardinia</pl>, under <prn id='Q2661436'>Norax</prn> as leader of the expedition, and they founded the city of <pl id='Q677175'>Nora</pl>. The tradition is that this was the first city in the island, and they say that <prn id='Q2661436'>Norax</prn> was a son of Erytheia, the daughter of <prn id='Q86805'>Geryones</prn>, with <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> for his father. A fourth component part of the population was the army of <prn id='Q504076'>Iolaus</prn>, consisting of <pl id='Q1141295'>Thespians</pl> and men from <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl>, which put in at <pl id='Q3760293'>Sardinia</pl> and founded Olbia; by themselves the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> founded <prn id='Q91109416'>Ogryle</prn>, either in commemoration of one of their demes in the home-land, or else because one <prn id='Q91109416'>Ogrylus</prn> himself took part in the expedition. Be this as it may, there are still today places in <pl id='Q3760293'>Sardinia</pl> called Iolaia, and <prn id='Q504076'>Iolaus</prn> is worshipped by the inhabitants. </p>
<p id='10.17.6'><b>10.17.6</b> When <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl> was taken, among those <pl id='Q22647'>Trojans</pl> who fled were those who escaped with <prn id='Q82732'>Aeneas</prn>. A part of them, carried from their course by winds, reached <pl id='Q3760293'>Sardinia</pl> and intermarried with the Greeks already settled there. But the non-Greek element were prevented from coming to blows with the Greeks and <pl id='Q22647'>Trojans</pl>, for the two enemies were evenly matched in all warlike equipment, while the river <pl id='Q22956226'>Thorsus</pl>, flowing between their territories, made both equally afraid to cross it. </p>
<p id='10.17.7'><b>10.17.7</b> However, many years afterwards the <pl id='Q2370577'>Libyans</pl> crossed again to the island with a stronger army, and began a war against the Greeks. The Greeks were utterly destroyed, or only a few of them survived. The <pl id='Q22647'>Trojans</pl> made their escape to the high parts of the island, and occupied mountains difficult to climb, being precipitous and protected by stakes. Even at the present day they are called <pl id='Q22647'>Ilians</pl>, but in figure, in the fashion of their arms, and in their mode of living generally, they are like the <pl id='Q2370577'>Libyans</pl>. </p>
<p id='10.17.8'><b>10.17.8</b> Not far distant from <pl id='Q3760293'>Sardinia</pl> is an island, called <pl id='Q1784775'>Cyrnus</pl> by the Greeks, but <pl id='Q1784775'>Corsica</pl> by the <pl id='Q2370577'>Libyans</pl> who inhabit it. A large part of the population, oppressed by civil strife, left it and came to <pl id='Q3760293'>Sardinia</pl>; there they took up their abode, confining themselves to the highlands. The <pl id='Q3760293'>Sardinians</pl>, however, call them by the name of <pl id='Q1784775'>Corsicans</pl>, which they brought with them from home. </p>
<p id='10.17.9'><b>10.17.9</b> When the <pl id='Q6343'>Carthaginians</pl> were at the height of their sea power, they overcame all in <pl id='Q3760293'>Sardinia</pl> except the <pl id='Q22647'>Ilians</pl> and <pl id='Q1784775'>Corsicans</pl>, who were kept from slavery by the strength of the mountains. These <pl id='Q6343'>Carthaginians</pl>, like those who preceded them, founded cities in the island, namely, <pl id='Q1897'>Caralis</pl> and <pl id='Q1782566'>Sulci</pl>. Some of the Carthaginian mercenaries, either <pl id='Q2370577'>Libyans</pl> or <pl id='Q1203967'>Iberians</pl>, quarrelled about the booty, mutinied in a passion, and added to the number of the highland settlers. Their name in the Cyrnian language is BalariYY, which is the Cyrnian word for fugitives. </p>
<p id='10.17.10'><b>10.17.10</b> These are the races that dwell in <pl id='Q3760293'>Sardinia</pl>, and such was the method of their settlement. The northern part of the island and that towards the mainland of <pl id='Q913582'>Italy</pl> consist of an unbroken chain of impassable mountains. And if you sail along the coast you will find no anchorage on this side of the island, while violent but irregular gusts of wind sweep down to the sea from the tops of the mountains. </p>
<p id='10.17.11'><b>10.17.11</b> Across the middle of the island runs another chain of mountains, but lower in height. The atmosphere here is on the whole heavy and unwholesome. The reason is partly the salt that crystallizes here, partly the oppressive, violent south wind, and partly the fact that, because of the height of the mountains on the side towards <pl id='Q913582'>Italy</pl>, the north winds are prevented, when they blow in summer, from cooling the atmosphere and the ground here. Others say that the cause is <pl id='Q1784775'>Cyrnus</pl>, which is separated from <pl id='Q3760293'>Sardinia</pl> by no more than eight stades of sea, and is hilly and high all over. So they think that <pl id='Q1784775'>Cyrnus</pl> prevents <prn id='Q467515'>Zephyros</prn> and <prn id='Q109220'>Boreas</prn> (the west wind and north wind) from reaching as far as <pl id='Q3760293'>Sardinia</pl>. </p>
<p id='10.17.12'><b>10.17.12</b> Neither poisonous nor harmless <prn id='Q2102'>snakes</prn> can live in <pl id='Q3760293'>Sardinia</pl>, nor yet <prn id='Q18498'>wolves</prn>. The he-<prn id='Q2934'>goats</prn> are no bigger than those found elsewhere, but their shape is that of the wild ram which an artist would carve in <pl id='Q191082'>Aeginetan</pl> style, except that their breasts are too shaggy to liken them to <pl id='Q191082'>Aeginetan</pl> art. Their horns do not stand out away from the head, but curl straight beside the ears. In speed they are the swiftest of all beasts. </p>
<p id='10.17.13'><b>10.17.13</b> Except for one plant the island is free from poisons. This deadly herb is like celery, and they say that those who eat it die laughing. Wherefore <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>, and men after him, call unwholesome laughter sardonic. The herb grows mostly around springs, but does not impart any of its poison to the water. I have introduced into my history of <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl> this account of <pl id='Q3760293'>Sardinia</pl>, because it is an island about which the Greeks are very ignorant. </p>
<p id='10.18.1'><b>10.18.1</b> The <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn> next to the statue of <prn id='Q1276974'>Sardus</prn> was dedicated, says the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> <prn id='Q970958'>Callias</prn> son of LysimachiYY, in the inscription, by <prn id='Q970958'>Callias</prn> himself from spoils he had taken in the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl> war. The <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> dedicated an image of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> after reducing by siege one of the cities of <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolia</pl>, the name of which was Phana. They say that the siege was not a short one, and being unable to take the city, they sent envoys to <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>, to whom was given the following response: </p>
<p id='10.18.2'><b>10.18.2</b> “Dwellers in the land of <prn id='Q192485'>Pelops</prn> and in <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaia</pl>, who to <pl id='Q682558'>Pytho</pl> <br>Have come to inquire how ye shall take a city, <br>Come, consider what daily ration, <br>Drunk by the folk, saves the city which has so drunk. <br>For so ye may take the towered village of Phana.” </p>
<p id='10.18.3'><b>10.18.3</b> So not understanding what was the meaning of the oracle, they were minded to raise the siege and sail away, while the defenders paid no attention to them, one of their women coming from behind the walls to fetch water from the spring just under them. Some of the besiegers ran up and took the woman prisoner, who informed the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> that the scanty water from the spring, that was fetched each night, was rationed among the besieged, who had nothing else to quench their thirst. So the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl>, by filling up the spring, captured the town. </p>
<p id='10.18.4'><b>10.18.4</b> By the side of this <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> the <pl id='Q13533316'>Rhodians</pl> of <pl id='Q65122097'>Lindus</pl> set up their image of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>. The <pl id='Q21027705'>Ambraciots</pl> dedicated also a bronze <prn id='Q19707'>ass</prn>, having conquered the <pl id='Q11937293'>Molossians</pl> in a night battle. The <pl id='Q11937293'>Molossians</pl> had prepared an ambush for them by night. It chanced that an <prn id='Q19707'>ass</prn>, being driven back from the fields, was chasing a she-<prn id='Q19707'>ass</prn> with harsh braying and wanton gait, while the driver of the <prn id='Q19707'>ass</prn> increased the din by his horrible, inarticulate yells. So the men in the <pl id='Q11937293'>Molossian</pl> ambush rushed out affrighted, and the <pl id='Q21027705'>Ambraciots</pl>, detecting the trap prepared for them, attacked in the night and overcame the <pl id='Q11937293'>Molossians</pl> in battle. </p>
<p id='10.18.5'><b>10.18.5</b> The men of <pl id='Q7103538'>Orneae</pl> in <pl id='Q12649101'>Argolis</pl>, when hard pressed in war by the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl>, vowed to <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> that, if they should drive the host of the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl> out of their native land, they would organize a daily procession in his honor at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>, and sacrifice victims of a certain kind and of a certain number. Well, they conquered the <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonians</pl> in battle. But finding the daily fulfillment of their vow a great expense and a still greater trouble, they devised the trick of dedicating to the god bronze figures representing a sacrifice and a procession. </p>
<p id='10.18.6'><b>10.18.6</b> There is here one of the labours of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, namely, his fight with the <prn id='Q170379'>Hydra</prn>. <prn id='Q20102055'>Tisagoras</prn> not only dedicated the offering, but also made it. Both the <prn id='Q170379'>Hydra</prn> and <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> are of iron. To make images of iron is a very difficult task, involving great labour. So the work of <prn id='Q20102055'>Tisagoras</prn>, whoever he was, is marvellous. Very marvellous too are the heads of a <prn id='Q140'>lion</prn> and wild <prn id='Q58697'>boar</prn> at <pl id='Q18986'>Pergamus</pl>, also of iron, which were made as offerings to <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>. </p>

The <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, very near to the <prn id='Q140'>lion</prn>, was dedicated by the <pl id='Q2566850'>Massiliots</pl> as firstfruits of their naval victory over the <pl id='Q6343'>Carthaginians</pl>. The <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolians</pl> have made a trophy and the image of an armed woman, supposed to represent <prn id='Q91121093'>Aetolia</prn>. These were dedicated by the <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolians</pl> when they had punished the Gauls for their cruelty to the <pl id='Q38281541'>Callians</pl>. A gilt statue, offered by <prn id='Q179785'>Gorgias</prn> of <pl id='Q3830644'>Leontini</pl>, is a portrait of <prn id='Q179785'>Gorgias</prn> himself. </p>
<p id='10.19.1'><b>10.19.1</b> Beside the <prn id='Q179785'>Gorgias</prn> is a votive offering of the <prn id='Q182875'>Amphictyons</prn>, representing <prn id='Q14325358'>Scyllis</prn> of <pl id='Q963571'>Scione</pl>, who, tradition says, dived into the very deepest parts of every sea.

In return for this deed the <prn id='Q182875'>Amphictyons</prn> dedicated statues of <prn id='Q14325358'>Scyllis</prn> and his daughter. The statue of <prn id='Q16845943'>Hydna</prn> completed the number of the statues that <prn id='Q1413'>Nero</prn> carried off from <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>. Only those of the female sex who are pure virgins may dive into the sea. </p>
<p id='10.19.3'><b>10.19.3</b> I am going on to tell a <pl id='Q128087'>Lesbian</pl> story. Certain fishermen of <pl id='Q38281278'>Methymna</pl> found that their nets dragged up to the surface of the sea a face made of olive-wood. Its appearance suggested a touch of divinity, but it was outlandish, and unlike the normal features of Greek gods. So the people of <pl id='Q38281278'>Methymna</pl> asked the <prn id='Q220344'>Pythian priestess</prn> of what god or hero the figure was a likeness, and she bade them worship <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> <prn id='Q91094166'>Phallen</prn>. Whereupon the people of <pl id='Q38281278'>Methymna</pl> kept for themselves the wooden image out of the sea, worshipping it with sacrifices and prayers, but sent a bronze copy to <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>. </p>
<p id='10.19.4'><b>10.19.4</b> The carvings in the pediments are: <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, <prn id='Q103107'>Leto</prn>, <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, <prn id='Q66016'>Muses</prn>, a setting <prn id='Q134270'>Sun</prn>, and <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> together with the <prn id='Q3526162'>Thyiad</prn> women. The first of them are the work of <prn id='Q4891782'>Praxias</prn>, an <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> and a pupil of <prn id='Q918382'>Calamis</prn>, but the temple took some time to build, during which <prn id='Q4891782'>Praxias</prn> died. So the rest of the ornament in the pediments was carved by <prn id='Q15619611'>Androsthenes</prn>, like <prn id='Q4891782'>Praxias</prn> an <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> by birth, but a pupil of <prn id='Q11921133'>Eucadmus</prn>. There are arms of gold on the architraves; the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> dedicated the shields from spoils taken at the battle of <pl id='Q31900'>Marathon</pl>, and the <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolians</pl> the arms, supposed to be Gallic, behind and on the left. Their shape is very like that of <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl> wicker shields. </p>
<p id='10.19.5'><b>10.19.5</b> I have made some mention of the Gallic invasion of Greece in my description of the <pl id='Q38278350'>Bouleuterion</pl> in my Attica account. But I have resolved to give a more detailed account of the Gauls in my description of <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>, because the greatest of the Greek exploits against the barbarians took place there. The <pl id='Q35966'>Celts</pl> conducted their first foreign expedition under the leadership of <prn id='Q16183533'>Cambaules</prn>. Advancing as far as <pl id='Q41741'>Thrace</pl> they lost heart and broke off their march, realizing that they were too few in number to be a match for the Greeks. </p>
<p id='10.19.6'><b>10.19.6</b> But when they decided to invade foreign territory a second time, so great was the influence of <prn id='Q16183533'>Cambaules</prn>' veterans, who had tasted the joy of plunder and acquired a passion for robbery and plunder, that a large force of infantry and no small number of mounted men attended the muster. So the army was split up into three divisions by the chieftains, to each of whom was assigned a separate land to invade. </p>
<p id='10.19.7'><b>10.19.7</b> Cerethrius was to be leader against the <pl id='Q41741'>Thracians</pl> and the nation of the <pl id='Q1257541'>Triballi</pl>. The invaders of <pl id='Q249561'>Paeonia</pl> were under the command of <prn id='Q314911'>Brennus</prn> and <prn id='Q3555328'>Acichorius</prn>. <prn id='Q815552'>Bolgius</prn> attacked the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> and <pl id='Q32047'>Illyrians</pl>, and engaged in a struggle with <prn id='Q299387'>Ptolemy</prn>, king of the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> at that time. It was this <prn id='Q299387'>Ptolemy</prn> who, though he had taken refuge as a suppliant with <prn id='Q184176'>Seleucus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q579596'>Antiochus</prn>, treacherously murdered him, and was surnamed Keraunos (Thunderbolt) because of his recklessness. <prn id='Q299387'>Ptolemy</prn> himself perished in the fighting, and the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonian</pl> losses were heavy. But once more the <pl id='Q35966'>Celts</pl> lacked courage to advance against Greece, and so the second expedition returned home. </p>
<p id='10.19.8'><b>10.19.8</b> It was then that <prn id='Q314911'>Brennus</prn>, both in public meetings and also in personal talks with individual Gallic officers, strongly urged a campaign against Greece, enlarging on the weakness of Greece at the time, on the wealth of the Greek states, and on the even greater wealth in sanctuaries, including votive offerings and coined silver and gold. So he induced the Gauls to march against Greece. Among the officers he chose to be his colleagues was <prn id='Q3555328'>Acichorius</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.19.9'><b>10.19.9</b> The muster of foot amounted to one hundred and fifty-two thousand, with twenty thousand four hundred <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn>. This was the number of horsemen in action at any one time, but the real number was sixty-one thousand two hundred. For to each horseman were attached two servants, who were themselves skilled riders and, like their masters, had a <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.19.10'><b>10.19.10</b> When the Gallic horsemen were engaged, the servants remained behind the ranks and proved useful in the following way. Should a horseman or his <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn> fall, the slave brought him a <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn> to mount; if the rider was killed, the slave mounted the <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn> in his master's place; if both rider and <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn> were killed, there was a mounted man ready. When a rider was wounded, one slave brought back to camp the wounded man, while the other took his vacant place in the ranks. </p>
<p id='10.19.11'><b>10.19.11</b> I believe that the Gauls in adopting these methods copied the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl> regiment of the Ten Thousand, who were called the Immortals. There was, however, this difference. The <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl> used to wait until the battle was over before replacing casualties, while the Gauls kept reinforcing the horsemen to their full number during the height of the action. This organization is called in their native speech trimarcisia, for I would have you know that marca is the <pl id='Q35966'>Celtic</pl> name for a <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.19.12'><b>10.19.12</b> This was the size of the army, and such was the intention of <prn id='Q314911'>Brennus</prn>, when he attacked Greece. The spirit of the Greeks was utterly broken, but the extremity of their terror forced them to defend Greece. They realized that the struggle that faced them would not be one for liberty, as it was when they fought the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl>, and that giving water and earth would not bring them safety. They still remembered the fate of <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl>, <pl id='Q41741'>Thrace</pl> and <pl id='Q249561'>Paeonia</pl> during the former incursion of the Gauls, and reports were coming in of enormities committed at that very time on the <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessalians</pl>. So every man, as well as every state, was convinced that they must either conquer or perish. </p>
<p id='10.20.1'><b>10.20.1</b> Any one who so wishes can compare the number of those who mustered to meet king <prn id='Q129165'>Xerxes</prn> at <pl id='Q194450'>Thermopylae</pl> with those who now mustered to oppose the Gauls. To meet the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl> there came Greek contingents of the following strength. <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> with <prn id='Q44228'>Leonidas</prn> not more than three hundred; <pl id='Q645234'>Tegeans</pl> five hundred, and five hundred from <pl id='Q1160195'>Mantineia</pl>; from <pl id='Q1855083'>Orchomenus</pl> in <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl> a hundred and twenty; from the other cities in <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl> one thousand; from <pl id='Q132564'>Mycenae</pl> eighty; from <pl id='Q1412043'>Phlius</pl> two hundred, and from <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinth</pl> twice this number; of the <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotians</pl> there mustered seven hundred from <pl id='Q1141295'>Thespiae</pl> and four hundred from <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>. A thousand <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> guarded the path on Mount <pl id='Q132378'>Oeta</pl>, and the number of these should be added to the Greek total. </p>
<p id='10.20.2'><b>10.20.2</b> <prn id='Q26825'>Herodotus</prn> does not give the number of the Locrians under Mount Cnemis, but he does say that each of their cities sent a contingent. It is possible, however, to make an estimate of these also that comes very near to the truth. For not more than nine thousand <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> marched to <pl id='Q31900'>Marathon</pl>, even if we include those who were too old for active service and slaves; so the number of Locrian fighting men who marched to <pl id='Q194450'>Thermopylae</pl> cannot have exceeded six thousand. So the whole army would amount to eleven thousand two hundred. But it is well known that not even these remained all the time guarding the pass; for if we except the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl>, <pl id='Q1141295'>Thespians</pl> and <pl id='Q132564'>Mycenaeans</pl>, the rest left the field before the conclusion of the fighting. </p>
<p id='10.20.3'><b>10.20.3</b> To meet the barbarians who came from the Ocean the following Greek forces came to <pl id='Q194450'>Thermopylae</pl>. Of the <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotians</pl> ten thousand hoplites and five hundred cavalry, the <prn id='Q1019919'>Boeotarchs</prn> being <prn id='Q91121919'>Cephisodotus</prn>, <prn id='Q91121921'>Thearidas</prn>, <prn id='Q91121918'>Diogenes</prn> and <prn id='Q143559'>Lysander</prn>. From <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl> came five hundred cavalry with footmen three thousand in number. The generals of the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> were <prn id='Q91121900'>Critobulus</prn> and <prn id='Q91121899'>Antiochus</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.20.4'><b>10.20.4</b> The <pl id='Q3354839'>Locrians</pl> over against the island of <prn id='Q190323'>Atalanta</prn> were under the command of <prn id='Q91121915'>Meidias</prn>; they numbered seven hundred, and no cavalry was with them. Of the <pl id='Q42307600'>Megarians</pl> came four hundred hoplites commanded by <prn id='Q606604'>Hipponicus</prn> of <pl id='Q42307600'>Megara</pl>. The <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolians</pl> sent a large contingent, including every class of fighting men; the number of cavalry is not given, but the light-armed were seven hundred and ninety, and their hoplites numbered more than seven thousand. Their leaders were <prn id='Q91126521'>Polyarchus</prn>, <prn id='Q91121907'>Polyphron</prn> and <prn id='Q91121906'>Lacrates</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.20.5'><b>10.20.5</b> The <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> general was <prn id='Q11910956'>Callippus</prn>, the son of Moerocles, as I have said in an earlier part of my work, and their forces consisted of all their seaworthy triremes, five hundred <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn> and one thousand foot. Because of their ancient reputation the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> held the chief command. The king of <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl> sent five hundred mercenaries, and the king of <prn id='Q48'>Asia</prn> a like number; the leader of those sent by <prn id='Q241386'>Antigonus</prn> was <prn id='Q91121923'>Aristodemus</prn>, a <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonian</pl>, and <prn id='Q7696793'>Telesarchus</prn>, one of the Syrians on the <pl id='Q188871'>Orontes</pl>, commanded the forces that <prn id='Q211488'>Antiochus</prn> sent from <prn id='Q48'>Asia</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.20.6'><b>10.20.6</b> When the Greeks assembled at <pl id='Q194450'>Thermopylae</pl> learned that the army of the Gauls was already in the neighborhood of <pl id='Q60790367'>Magnesia</pl> and <pl id='Q2089144'>Phthiotis</pl>, they resolved to detach the cavalry and a thousand light armed troops and to send them to the <pl id='Q426309'>Spercheius</pl>, so that even the crossing of the river could not be effected by the barbarians without a struggle and risks. On their arrival these forces broke down the bridges and by themselves encamped along the bank. But <prn id='Q314911'>Brennus</prn> himself was not utterly stupid, nor inexperienced, for a barbarian, in devising tricks of strategy. </p>
<p id='10.20.7'><b>10.20.7</b> So on that very night he despatched some troops to the <pl id='Q426309'>Spercheius</pl>, not to the places where the old bridges had stood, but lower down, where the Greeks would not notice the crossing, and just where the river spread over the plain and made a marsh and lake instead of a narrow, violent stream. Hither <prn id='Q314911'>Brennus</prn> sent some ten thousand Gauls, picking out the swimmers and the tallest men; and the <pl id='Q35966'>Celts</pl> as a race are far taller than any other people. </p>
<p id='10.20.8'><b>10.20.8</b> So these crossed in the night, swimming over the river where it expands into a lake; each man used his shield, his national buckler, as a raft, and the tallest of them were able to cross the water by wading. The Greeks on the <pl id='Q426309'>Spercheius</pl>, as soon as they learned that a detachment of the barbarians had crossed by the marsh, forthwith retreated to the main army. <prn id='Q314911'>Brennus</prn> ordered the dwellers round the <pl id='Q549658'>Malian</pl> Gulf to build bridges across the <pl id='Q426309'>Spercheius</pl>, and they proceeded to accomplish their task with a will, for they were frightened of <prn id='Q314911'>Brennus</prn>, and anxious for the barbarians to go away out of their country instead of staying to devastate it further. </p>
<p id='10.20.9'><b>10.20.9</b> <prn id='Q314911'>Brennus</prn> brought his army across over the bridges and proceeded to <pl id='Q1231448'>Heracleia</pl>. The Gauls plundered the country, and massacred those whom they caught in the fields, but did not capture the city. For a year previous to this the <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolians</pl> had forced <pl id='Q1231448'>Heracleia</pl> to join the <prn id='Q245273'>Aetolian League</prn>; so now they defended a city which they considered to belong to them just as much as to the <pl id='Q1231448'>Heracleots</pl>. <prn id='Q314911'>Brennus</prn> did not trouble himself much about <pl id='Q1231448'>Heracleia</pl>, but directed his efforts to driving away those opposed to him at the pass, in order to invade Greece south of <pl id='Q194450'>Thermopylae</pl>. </p>
<p id='10.21.1'><b>10.21.1</b> Deserters kept <prn id='Q314911'>Brennus</prn> informed about the forces from each city mustered at <pl id='Q194450'>Thermopylae</pl>. So despising the Greek army he advanced from <pl id='Q1231448'>Heracleia</pl>, and began the battle at sun-rise on the next day. He had no Greek soothsayer, and made no use of his own country's sacrifices, if indeed the <pl id='Q35966'>Celts</pl> have any art of divination. Whereupon the Greeks attacked silently and in good order. When they came to close quarters, the infantry did not rush out of their line far enough to disturb their proper formation, while the light-armed troops remained in position, throwing javelins, shooting arrows or slinging bullets. </p>
<p id='10.21.2'><b>10.21.2</b> The cavalry on both sides proved useless, as the ground at the Pass is not only narrow, but also smooth because of the natural rock, while most of it is slippery owing to its being covered with streams. The Gauls were worse armed than the Greeks, having no other defensive armour than their national shields, while they were still more inferior in war experience. </p>
<p id='10.21.3'><b>10.21.3</b> On they marched against their enemies with the unreasoning fury and passion of brutes. Slashed with axe or sword they kept their desperation while they still breathed; pierced by arrow or javelin, they did not abate of their passion so long as life remained. Some drew out from their wounds the spears, by which they had been hit, and threw them at the Greeks or used them in close fighting. </p>
<p id='10.21.4'><b>10.21.4</b> Meanwhile the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> on the triremes, with difficulty and with danger, nevertheless coasted along through the mud that extends far out to sea, brought their ships as close to the barbarians as possible, and raked them with arrows and every other kind of missile. The <pl id='Q35966'>Celts</pl> were in unspeakable distress, and as in the confined space they inflicted few losses but suffered twice or four times as many, their captains gave the signal to retire to their camp. Retreating in confusion and without any order, many were crushed beneath the feet of their friends, and many others fell into the swamp and disappeared under the mud. Their loss in the retreat was no less than the loss that occurred while the battle raged. </p>
<p id='10.21.5'><b>10.21.5</b> On this day the <pl id='Q122443'>Attic</pl> contingent surpassed the other Greeks in courage. Of the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> themselves the bravest was <prn id='Q91121925'>Cydias</prn>, a young man who had never before been in battle. He was killed by the Gauls, but his relatives dedicated his shield to <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> <prn id='Q106542644'>Eleutherios</prn>, and the inscription ran: “Here hang I, yearning for the still youthful bloom of <prn id='Q91121925'>Cydias</prn>, The shield of a glorious man, an offering to <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>. I was the very first through which at this battle he thrust his left arm, When furious Ares was at his peak against the Gaul.” </p>
<p id='10.21.6'><b>10.21.6</b> This inscription remained until <prn id='Q483783'>Sulla</prn> and his army took away, among other <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> treasures, the shields in the <pl id='Q331355'>Stoa of Zeus</pl> <prn id='Q106542644'>Eleutherios</prn>. After this battle at <pl id='Q194450'>Thermopylae</pl> the Greeks buried their own dead and spoiled the barbarians, but the Gauls sent no herald to ask leave to take up the bodies, and were indifferent whether the earth received them or whether they were devoured by wild beasts or carrion birds. </p>
<p id='10.21.7'><b>10.21.7</b> There were in my opinion two reasons that made them careless about the burial of their dead: they wished to strike terror into their enemies, and through habit they have no tender feeling for those who have gone. In the battle there fell forty of the Greeks; the losses of the barbarians it was impossible to discover exactly. For the number of them that disappeared beneath the mud was great. </p>
<p id='10.22.1'><b>10.22.1</b> On the seventh day after the battle a regiment of Gauls attempted to go up to <pl id='Q132378'>Oeta</pl> by way of <pl id='Q1231448'>Heracleia</pl>. Here too a narrow path rises just past the ruins of <pl id='Q1231448'>Trachis</pl>. There was also at that time a sanctuary of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> above the Trachinian territory, and in it were votive offerings. So they hoped to ascend <pl id='Q132378'>Oeta</pl> by this path and at the same time to get possession of the offerings in the temple in passing. [This path was defended by the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> under <prn id='Q7696793'>Telesarchus</prn>.] They overcame the barbarians in the engagement, but <prn id='Q7696793'>Telesarchus</prn> himself fell, a man devoted, if ever a man was, to the Greek cause. </p>
<p id='10.22.2'><b>10.22.2</b> All the leaders of the barbarians except <prn id='Q314911'>Brennus</prn> were terrified of the Greeks, and at the same time were despondent of the future, seeing that their present condition showed no signs of improvement. But <prn id='Q314911'>Brennus</prn> reasoned that if he could compel the <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolians</pl> to return home to <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolia</pl>, he would find the war against Greece prove easier hereafter. So he detached from his army forty thousand foot and about eight hundred <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn>. Over these he set in command <prn id='Q91111184'>Orestorius</prn> and <prn id='Q91111181'>Combutis</prn>, who, making their way back by way of the bridges over the <pl id='Q426309'>Spercheius</pl> </p>
<p id='10.22.3'><b>10.22.3</b> and across <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessaly</pl> again, invaded <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolia</pl>. The fate of the <pl id='Q38281541'>Callians</pl> at the hands of <prn id='Q91111181'>Combutis</prn> and <prn id='Q91111184'>Orestorius</prn> is the most wicked ever heard of, and is without a parallel in the crimes of men. Every male they put to the sword, and there were butchered old men equally with children at their mothers' breasts. The more plump of these sucking babes the Gauls killed, drinking their blood and eating their flesh. </p>
<p id='10.22.4'><b>10.22.4</b> Women and adult maidens, if they had any spirit at all in them, anticipated their end when the city was captured. Those who survived suffered under imperious violence every form of outrage at the hands of men equally void of pity or of love. Every woman who chanced to find a Gallic sword committed suicide. The others were soon to die of hunger and want of sleep, the incontinent barbarians outraging them by turns, and sating their lust even on the dying and the dead. </p>
<p id='10.22.5'><b>10.22.5</b> The <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolians</pl> had been informed by messengers what disasters had befallen them, and at once with all speed removed their forces from <pl id='Q194450'>Thermopylae</pl> and hastened to <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolia</pl>, being exasperated at the sufferings of the <pl id='Q38281541'>Callians</pl>, and still more fired with determination to save the cities not yet captured. From all the cities at home were mobilized the men of military age; and even those too old for service, their fighting spirit roused by the crisis, were in the ranks, and their very women gladly served with them, being even more enraged against the Gauls than were the men. </p>
<p id='10.22.6'><b>10.22.6</b> When the barbarians, having pillaged houses and sanctuaries, and having fired <pl id='Q38281541'>Callium</pl>, were returning by the same way, they were met by the <pl id='Q133123'>Patraeans</pl>, who alone of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> were helping the <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolians</pl>. Being trained as hoplites they made a frontal attack on the barbarians, but suffered severely owing to the number and desperation of the Gauls. But the <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolians</pl>, men and women, drawn up all along the road, kept shooting at the barbarians, and few shots failed to find a mark among enemies protected by nothing but their national shields. Pursued by the Gauls they easily escaped, renewing their attack with vigor when their enemies returned from the pursuit. </p>
<p id='10.22.7'><b>10.22.7</b> Although the <pl id='Q38281541'>Callians</pl> suffered so terribly that even <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>'s account of the <prn id='Q743931'>Laestrygones</prn> and the <prn id='Q128430'>Cyclops</prn> does not seem outside the truth, yet they were duly and fully avenged. For out of their number of forty thousand eight hundred, there escaped of the barbarians to the camp at <pl id='Q194450'>Thermopylae</pl> less than one half. </p>
<p id='10.22.8'><b>10.22.8</b> Meantime the Greeks at <pl id='Q194450'>Thermopylae</pl> were faring as follows. There are two paths across Mount <pl id='Q132378'>Oeta</pl>: the one above Trachis is very steep, and for the most part precipitous; the other, through the territory of the <pl id='Q4697441'>Aenianians</pl>, is easier for an army to cross. It was through this that on a former occasion <prn id='Q1265303'>Hydarnes</prn> the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl> passed to attack in the rear the Greeks under <prn id='Q44228'>Leonidas</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.22.9'><b>10.22.9</b> By this road the <pl id='Q1231448'>Heracleots</pl> and the <pl id='Q4697441'>Aenianians</pl> promised to lead <prn id='Q314911'>Brennus</prn>, not that they were ill-disposed to the Greek cause, but because they were anxious for the <pl id='Q35966'>Celts</pl> to go away from their country, and not to establish themselves in it to its ruin. I think that <prn id='Q134929'>Pindar</prn> spoke the truth again when he said that every one is crushed by his own misfortunes but is untouched by the woes of others. </p>
<p id='10.22.10'><b>10.22.10</b> <prn id='Q314911'>Brennus</prn> was encouraged by the promise made by the <pl id='Q4697441'>Aenianians</pl> and <pl id='Q1231448'>Heracleots</pl>. Leaving <prn id='Q3555328'>Acichorius</prn> behind in charge of the main army, with instructions that it was to attack only when the enveloping movement was complete, <prn id='Q314911'>Brennus</prn> himself, with a detachment of forty thousand, began his march along the pass. </p>
<p id='10.22.11'><b>10.22.11</b> It so happened on that day that the mist rolled thick down the mountain, darkening the sun, so that the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> who were guarding the path found the barbarians upon them before they were aware of their approach. Thereupon the Gauls attacked. The <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> resisted manfully, but at last were forced to retreat from the path. However, they succeeded in running down to their friends with a report of what was happening before the envelopment of the Greek army was quite complete on all sides. </p>
<p id='10.22.12'><b>10.22.12</b> Whereupon the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> with the fleet succeeded in withdrawing in time the Greek forces from <pl id='Q194450'>Thermopylae</pl>, which disbanded and returned to their several homes. <prn id='Q314911'>Brennus</prn>, without delaying any longer, began his march against <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> without waiting for the army with <prn id='Q3555328'>Acichorius</prn> to join up. In terror the <pl id='Q75459'>Delphians</pl> took refuge in the oracle. The god bade them not to be afraid, and promised that he would himself defend his own. </p>
<p id='10.22.13'><b>10.22.13</b> The Greeks who came in defence of the god were as follow: the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl>, who came from all their cities; from <pl id='Q38281545'>Amphissa</pl> four hundred hoplites; from the <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolians</pl> a few came at once on hearing of the advance of the barbarians, and later on <prn id='Q4484273'>Philomelus</prn> brought one thousand two hundred. The flower of the <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolians</pl> turned against the army of <prn id='Q3555328'>Acichorius</prn>, and without offering battle attacked continuously the rear of their line of march, plundering the baggage and putting the carriers to the sword. It was chiefly for this reason that their march proved slow. Furthermore, at <pl id='Q1231448'>Heracleia</pl> <prn id='Q3555328'>Acichorius</prn> had left a part of his army, who were to guard the baggage of the camp. </p>
<p id='10.23.1'><b>10.23.1</b> <prn id='Q314911'>Brennus</prn> and his army were now faced by the Greeks who had mustered at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>, and soon portents boding no good to the barbarians were sent by the god, the clearest recorded in history. For the whole ground occupied by the Gallic army was shaken violently most of the day, with continuous thunder and lightning. </p>
<p id='10.23.2'><b>10.23.2</b> The thunder both terrified the Gauls and prevented them hearing their orders, while the bolts from heaven set on fire not only those whom they struck but also their neighbors, themselves and their armour alike. Then there were seen by them ghosts of the heroes <prn id='Q91121099'>Hyperochus</prn>, <prn id='Q14601907'>Laodocus</prn> and <prn id='Q322639'>Pyrrhus</prn>; according to some a fourth appeared, <prn id='Q3381822'>Phylacus</prn>, a local hero of <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>. </p>
<p id='10.23.3'><b>10.23.3</b> Among the many <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> who were killed in the action was <prn id='Q106323527'>Aleximachus</prn>, who in this battle excelled all the other Greeks in devoting youth, physical strength, and a stout heart, to slaying the barbarians. The <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> made a statue of <prn id='Q106323527'>Aleximachus</prn> and sent it to <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> as an offering to <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.23.4'><b>10.23.4</b> All the day the barbarians were beset by calamities and terrors of this kind. But the night was to bring upon them experiences far more painful. For there came on a severe frost, and snow with it; and great rocks slipping from <pl id='Q105261'>Parnassus</pl>, and crags breaking away, made the barbarians their target, the crash of which brought destruction, not on one or two at a time, but on thirty or even more, as they chanced to be gathered in groups, keeping guard or taking rest. </p>
<p id='10.23.5'><b>10.23.5</b> At sunrise the Greeks came on from <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>, making a frontal attack with the exception of the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl>, who, being more familiar with the district, descended through the snow down the precipitous parts of <pl id='Q105261'>Parnassus</pl>, and surprised the <pl id='Q35966'>Celts</pl> in their rear, shooting them down with arrows and javelins without anything to fear from the barbarians. </p>
<p id='10.23.6'><b>10.23.6</b> At the beginning of the fight the Gauls offered a spirited resistance, especially the company attached to <prn id='Q314911'>Brennus</prn>, which was composed of the tallest and bravest of the Gauls, and that though they were shot at from all sides, and no less distressed by the frost, especially the wounded men. But when <prn id='Q314911'>Brennus</prn> himself was wounded, he was carried fainting from the battle, and the barbarians, harassed on all sides by the Greeks, fell back reluctantly, putting to the sword those who, disabled by wounds or sickness, could not go with them. </p>
<p id='10.23.7'><b>10.23.7</b> They encamped where night overtook them in their retreat, and during the night there fell on them a “panic.” For causeless terrors are said to come from the god <prn id='Q132582'>Pan</prn>. It was when evening was turning to night that the confusion fell on the army, and at first only a few became mad, and these imagined that they heard the trampling of <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn> at a gallop, and the attack of advancing enemies; but after a little time the delusion spread to all. </p>
<p id='10.23.8'><b>10.23.8</b> So rushing to arms they divided into two parties, killing and being killed, neither understanding their mother tongue nor recognizing one another's forms or the shape of their shields. Both parties alike under the present delusion thought that their opponents were Greek, men and armour, and that the language they spoke was Greek, so that a great mutual slaughter was wrought among the Gauls by the madness sent by the god. </p>
<p id='10.23.9'><b>10.23.9</b> Those <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> who had been left behind in the fields to guard the flocks were the first to perceive and report to the Greeks the panic that had seized the barbarians in the night. The <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> were thus encouraged to attack the <pl id='Q35966'>Celts</pl> with yet greater spirit, keeping a more careful watch on their encampments, and not letting them take from the country the necessities of life without a struggle, so that the whole Gallic army suffered at once from a pressing shortage of corn and other food. </p>
<p id='10.23.10'><b>10.23.10</b> Their losses in <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl> were these: in the battles were killed close on six thousand; those who perished in the wintry storm at night and afterwards in the panic terror amounted to over ten thousand, as likewise did those who were starved to death. </p>
<p id='10.23.11'><b>10.23.11</b> <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> scouts arrived at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> to gather information, after which they returned and reported what had happened to the barbarians, and all that the god had inflicted upon them. Whereupon the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> took the field, and as they marched through <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl> they were joined by the <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotians</pl>. Thus the combined armies followed the barbarians, lying in wait and killing those who happened to be the last. </p>
<p id='10.23.12'><b>10.23.12</b> Those who fled with <prn id='Q314911'>Brennus</prn> had been joined by the army under <prn id='Q3555328'>Acichorius</prn> only on the previous night. For the <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolians</pl> had delayed their march, hurling at them a merciless shower of javelins and anything else they could lay hands on, so that only a small part of them escaped to the camp at <pl id='Q1231448'>Heracleia</pl>. There was still a hope of saving the life of <prn id='Q314911'>Brennus</prn>, so far as his wounds were concerned; but, they say, partly because he feared his fellow-countrymen, and still more because he was conscience-stricken at the calamities he had brought on Greece, he took his own life by drinking neat wine. </p>
<p id='10.23.13'><b>10.23.13</b> After this the barbarians proceeded with difficulty as far as the <pl id='Q426309'>Spercheius</pl>, pressed hotly by the <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolians</pl>. But after their arrival at the <pl id='Q426309'>Spercheius</pl>, during the rest of the retreat the <pl id='Q1247568'>Thessalians</pl> and <pl id='Q11934734'>Malians</pl> kept lying in wait for them, and so took their fill of slaughter that not a Gaul returned home in safety. </p>
<p id='10.23.14'><b>10.23.14</b> The expedition of the <pl id='Q35966'>Celts</pl> against Greece, and their destruction, took place when <prn id='Q91094679'>Anaxicrates</prn> <prn id='Q108823750'>was archon</prn> [279/8 BCE] at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl>, in the second year of the <prn id='Q57337820'>hundred and twenty-fifth Olympiad</prn>, when <prn id='Q19720603'>Ladas</prn> of <pl id='Q60790078'>Aegium</pl> was victor in the footrace.

<p id='10.24.1'><b>10.24.1</b> Such was the course of the war. In the <pl id='Q10751359'>fore-temple</pl> at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> are written maxims useful for the life of men, inscribed by those whom the Greeks say were sages. These were: from <pl id='Q620874'>Ionia</pl>, <prn id='Q36303'>Thales</prn> of <pl id='Q169460'>Miletus</pl> and <prn id='Q365977'>Bias</prn> of <pl id='Q142819'>Priene</pl>; of the <pl id='Q255325'>Aeolians</pl> in <pl id='Q128087'>Lesbos</pl>, <prn id='Q311835'>Pittacus</prn> of <pl id='Q42295059'>Mitylene</pl>; of the <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn> in <prn id='Q48'>Asia</prn>, <prn id='Q365950'>Cleobulus</prn> of <pl id='Q65122097'>Lindus</pl>; <prn id='Q133337'>Solon</prn> of <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> and <prn id='Q34601'>Chilon</prn> of <pl id='Q5690'>Sparta</pl>; the seventh sage, according to the list of <prn id='Q859'>Plato</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q667017'>Ariston</prn>, is not <prn id='Q328793'>Periander</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q430688'>Cypselus</prn>, but <prn id='Q920354'>Myson</prn> of <pl id='Q16454538'>Chenae</pl>, a village on Mount <pl id='Q132378'>Oeta</pl>. These sages, then, came to <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> and dedicated to <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> the celebrated maxims, “Know thyself,” and “Nothing in excess.” </p>
<p id='10.24.2'><b>10.24.2</b> So these men wrote what I have said, and you can see a bronze portrait of <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> on a stele, and read the oracle that they say <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> received: <br>“Blessed and unhappy, for to be both wast thou born. <br>Thou seekest thy father-land; but no father-land hast thou, only a mother-land.<br>The island of <pl id='Q216993'>Ios</pl> is the father-land of thy mother, which will receive thee <br>When thou hast died; but be on thy guard against the riddle of the young children.” <br>The inhabitants of <pl id='Q216993'>Ios</pl> point to <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>'s <pl id='Q58344705'>tomb</pl> in the island, and in another part to that of <prn id='Q91109233'>Clymene</prn>, who was, they say, the mother of <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.24.3'><b>10.24.3</b> But the <pl id='Q644636'>Cyprians</pl>, who also claim <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> as their own, say that <prn id='Q91109235'>Themisto</prn>, one of their native women, was the mother of <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>, and that <prn id='Q91121913'>Euclus</prn> foretold the birth of <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> in the following verses: <br>“And then in sea-girt <pl id='Q644636'>Cyprus</pl> there will be a mighty singer, <br>Whom <prn id='Q91109235'>Themisto</prn>, lady fair, shall bear in the fields, <br>A man of renown, far from rich <pl id='Q767089'>Salamis</pl>. <br>Leaving <pl id='Q644636'>Cyprus</pl>, tossed and wetted by the waves, <br>The first and only poet to sing of the woes of spacious Greece, <br>For ever shall he be deathless and ageless.” <br>These things I have heard, and I have read the oracles, but express no private opinion about either the age or date of <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.24.4'><b>10.24.4</b> In the <pl id='Q10751359'>temple</pl> has been built an altar of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, because <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> too possessed in part the most ancient oracle. There are also images of two <prn id='Q180287'>Fates</prn>; but in place of the third <prn id='Q180287'>Fate</prn> there stand by their side <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>, Guide of <prn id='Q180287'>Fate</prn> (Moiragetes), and <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> Moiragetes. Here you may behold the hearth on which the priest of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> killed <prn id='Q322639'>Neoptolemus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn>. The story of the end of <prn id='Q322639'>Neoptolemus</prn> I have told elsewhere. </p>
<p id='10.24.5'><b>10.24.5</b> Not far from the hearth has been dedicated a chair of <prn id='Q134929'>Pindar</prn>. The chair is of iron, and on it they say <prn id='Q134929'>Pindar</prn> sat whenever he came to <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>, and there composed his songs to <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>. Into the innermost part of the <pl id='Q10751359'>temple</pl> there pass but few, but there is dedicated in it another image of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, made of gold. </p>
<p id='10.24.6'><b>10.24.6</b> Leaving the <pl id='Q10751359'>temple</pl> and turning to the left you will come to an enclosure in which is the grave of <prn id='Q322639'>Neoptolemus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn>. Every year the <pl id='Q75459'>Delphians</pl> sacrifice to him as to a hero. Ascending from the tomb you come to a stone of no large size. Over it every day they pour olive oil, and at each feast they place on it unworked wool. There is also an opinion about this stone, that it was given to <prn id='Q44204'>Cronus</prn> instead of his child, and that <prn id='Q44204'>Cronus</prn> vomited it up again. </p>
<p id='10.24.7'><b>10.24.7</b> Coming back to the <pl id='Q10751359'>temple</pl> after seeing the stone, you come to the spring called <prn id='Q1735272'>Cassotis</prn>. By it is a wall of no great size, and the ascent to the spring is through the wall. It is said that the water of this <prn id='Q1735272'>Cassotis</prn> sinks under the ground, and inspires the women in the shrine of the god. She who gave her name to the spring is said to have been a nymph of <pl id='Q105261'>Parnassus</pl>. </p>
<p id='10.25.1'><b>10.25.1</b> Beyond the <prn id='Q1735272'>Cassotis</prn> stands a building with paintings of <prn id='Q182855'>Polygnotus</prn>. It was dedicated by the <pl id='Q690575'>Cnidians</pl>, and is called by the <pl id='Q75459'>Delphians</pl> <pl id='Q3830889'>Lesche</pl> (Club Room), because here in days of old they used to meet and chat about the more serious matters and legendary history. That there used to be many such places all over Greece is shown by <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>'s words in the passage where <prn id='Q1862383'>Melantho</prn> abuses <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn>: “And you will not go to the smith's house to sleep, Nor yet to the Lesche, but you make long speeches here.” </p>
<p id='10.25.2'><b>10.25.2</b> [POLYGNOTUS' PAINTINGS] Inside this building the whole of the painting on the right depicts <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl> taken and the Greeks sailing away. On the ship of <prn id='Q171839'>Menelaus</prn> they are preparing to put to sea. The ship is painted with children among the grown-up sailors; amidships is <prn id='Q12766117'>Phrontis</prn> the steersman holding two boat-hooks. <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> represents <prn id='Q193267'>Nestor</prn> as speaking about <prn id='Q12766117'>Phrontis</prn> in his conversation with <prn id='Q192482'>Telemachus</prn>, saying that he was the son of <prn id='Q91109169'>Onetor</prn> and the steersman of <prn id='Q171839'>Menelaus</prn>, of very high repute in his craft, and how he came to his end when he was already rounding <pl id='Q1136637'>Sunium</pl> in <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl>. Up to this point <prn id='Q171839'>Menelaus</prn> had been sailing along with <prn id='Q193267'>Nestor</prn>, but now he was left behind to build <prn id='Q12766117'>Phrontis</prn> a tomb, and to pay him the due rites of burial. </p>
<p id='10.25.3'><b>10.25.3</b> <prn id='Q12766117'>Phrontis</prn> then is in the painting of <prn id='Q182855'>Polygnotus</prn>, and beneath him is one <prn id='Q91121891'>Ithaemenes</prn> carrying clothes, and <prn id='Q91109417'>Echoeax</prn> is going down the gangway, carrying a bronze urn. <prn id='Q91110339'>Polites</prn>, <prn id='Q91109424'>Strophius</prn> and <prn id='Q91109425'>Alphius</prn> are pulling down the hut of <prn id='Q171839'>Menelaus</prn>, which is not far from the ship. Another hut is being pulled down by <prn id='Q21040933'>Amphialus</prn>, at whose feet is seated a boy. There is no inscription on the boy, and <prn id='Q12766117'>Phrontis</prn> is the only one with a beard. His too is the only name that <prn id='Q182855'>Polygnotus</prn> took from the <prn id='Q35160'>Odyssey</prn>; the names of the others he invented, I think, himself. </p>
<p id='10.25.4'><b>10.25.4</b> <prn id='Q244318'>Briseis</prn> is standing with <prn id='Q3028709'>Diomeda</prn> above her and <prn id='Q91126530'>Iphis</prn> in front of both; they appear to be examining the form of <prn id='Q164061'>Helen</prn>. <prn id='Q164061'>Helen</prn> herself is sitting, and so is <prn id='Q2665082'>Eurybates</prn> near her. We inferred that he was the herald of <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn>, although he had yet no beard. One handmaid, <prn id='Q2049871'>Panthalis</prn>, is standing beside <prn id='Q164061'>Helen</prn>; another, <prn id='Q60314512'>Electra</prn>, is fastening her mistress' sandals. These names too are different from those given by <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> in the <prn id='Q8275'>Iliad</prn>, where he tells of <prn id='Q164061'>Helen</prn> going to the wall with her slave women. </p>
<p id='10.25.5'><b>10.25.5</b> Beyond <prn id='Q164061'>Helen</prn>, a man wrapped in a purple cloak is sitting in an attitude of the deepest dejection; one might conjecture that he was <prn id='Q729332'>Helenus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q170473'>Priam</prn>, even before reading the inscription. Near <prn id='Q729332'>Helenus</prn> is <prn id='Q2300199'>Meges</prn>, who is wounded in the arm, as <prn id='Q2486846'>Lescheos</prn> of <pl id='Q6076774'>Pyrrha</pl>, son of Aeschylinus, describes in the <prn id='Q1627579'>Iliupersis</prn>. For he says that he was wounded by <prn id='Q91121089'>Admetus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q91109430'>Augeias</prn>, in the battle that the <pl id='Q22647'>Trojans</pl> fought in the night. </p>
<p id='10.25.6'><b>10.25.6</b> Beside <prn id='Q2300199'>Meges</prn> is also painted <prn id='Q15262316'>Lycomedes</prn> the son of <prn id='Q732066'>Creon</prn>, who has a wound in the wrist; <prn id='Q2486846'>Lescheos</prn> says he was so wounded by <prn id='Q2547185'>Agenor</prn>. So it is plain that <prn id='Q182855'>Polygnotus</prn> would not have represented them so wounded, if he had not read the poem of <prn id='Q2486846'>Lescheos</prn>. However, he has painted <prn id='Q15262316'>Lycomedes</prn> as wounded also in the ankle, and yet again in the head. <prn id='Q1378407'>Euryalus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q1968413'>Mecisteus</prn> has also received a wound in the head and another in the wrist. </p>
<p id='10.25.7'><b>10.25.7</b> These are painted higher up than <prn id='Q164061'>Helen</prn> in the picture. Next to <prn id='Q164061'>Helen</prn> comes the mother of <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> with her head shaved, and <prn id='Q912376'>Demophon</prn>, one of the sons of <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>, is considering, to judge from his attitude, whether it will be possible for him to rescue <prn id='Q11921121'>Aethra</prn>. The <pl id='Q13533353'>Argives</pl> say that <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> had also a son <prn id='Q22986507'>Melanippus</prn> by the daughter of <prn id='Q843335'>Sinis</prn>, and that <prn id='Q22986507'>Melanippus</prn> won a running-race when the <prn id='Q780650'>Epigoni</prn>, as they are called, held the second celebration of the <prn id='Q527006'>Nemean games</prn>, that of <prn id='Q223152'>Adrastus</prn> being the first. </p>
<p id='10.25.8'><b>10.25.8</b> <prn id='Q2486846'>Lescheos</prn> says of <prn id='Q11921121'>Aethra</prn> that, when <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl> was taken, she came stealthily to the Greek camp. She was recognized by the sons of <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>, and <prn id='Q912376'>Demophon</prn> asked for her from <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn>. He was ready to grant <prn id='Q912376'>Demophon</prn> the favour, but said that <prn id='Q164061'>Helen</prn> must first give her consent. He sent a herald, and <prn id='Q164061'>Helen</prn> granted him the favour. So in the painting <prn id='Q2665082'>Eurybates</prn> appears to have come to <prn id='Q164061'>Helen</prn> to ask about <prn id='Q11921121'>Aethra</prn>, and to be saying what he had been told to say by <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.25.9'><b>10.25.9</b> The <pl id='Q22647'>Trojan</pl> women are represented as already captives and lamenting. <prn id='Q19376'>Andromache</prn> is in the painting, and near stands her boy grasping her breast; this child <prn id='Q2486846'>Lescheos</prn> says was put to death by being flung from the tower, not that the Greeks had so decreed, but <prn id='Q322639'>Neoptolemus</prn>, of his own accord, was minded to murder him. In the painting is also <prn id='Q3332745'>Medesicaste</prn>, another of <prn id='Q170473'>Priam</prn>'s illegitimate daughters, who according to <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> left her home and went to the city of <prn id='Q115575338'>Pedaeum</prn> to be the wife of <prn id='Q3796598'>Imbrius</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q115575312'>Mentor</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.25.10'><b>10.25.10</b> <prn id='Q19376'>Andromache</prn> and <prn id='Q3332745'>Medesicaste</prn> are wearing hoods, but the hair of <prn id='Q750236'>Polyxena</prn> is braided after the custom of maidens. Poets sing of her death at the tomb of <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn>, and both at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> and at <pl id='Q18986'>Pergamus</pl> on the <pl id='Q1737602'>Caicus</pl> I have seen the tragedy of <prn id='Q750236'>Polyxena</prn> depicted in paintings. </p>
<p id='10.25.11'><b>10.25.11</b> The artist has painted <prn id='Q193267'>Nestor</prn> with a cap on his head and a spear in his hand. There is also a <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn>, in the attitude of one about to roll in the dust. Right up to the <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn> there is a beach with what appear to be pebbles, but beyond the <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn> the sea-scene breaks off. </p>
<p id='10.26.1'><b>10.26.1</b> Above the women between <prn id='Q11921121'>Aethra</prn> and <prn id='Q193267'>Nestor</prn> are other captive women, <prn id='Q4223631'>Clymene</prn>, <prn id='Q375174'>Creusa</prn>, <prn id='Q21548762'>Aristomache</prn> and <prn id='Q106346029'>Xenodice</prn>. Now <prn id='Q332797'>Stesichorus</prn>, in the <prn id='Q1627579'>Iliupersis</prn>, includes <prn id='Q4223631'>Clymene</prn> in the number of the captives; and similarly, in the <prn id='Q1999875'>Nostoi</prn> (Returns), he speaks of <prn id='Q21548762'>Aristomache</prn> as the daughter of <prn id='Q170473'>Priam</prn> and the wife of <prn id='Q91121085'>Critolaus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q1131939'>Hicetaon</prn>. But I know of no poet, and of no prose-writer, who makes mention of <prn id='Q106346029'>Xenodice</prn>. About <prn id='Q375174'>Creusa</prn> the story is told that the <prn id='Q334486'>Mother of the Gods</prn> and <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> rescued her from slavery among the Greeks, as she was, of course, the wife of <prn id='Q82732'>Aeneas</prn>. But <prn id='Q2486846'>Lescheos</prn> and the writer of the epic poem <prn id='Q1075630'>Cypria</prn> make <prn id='Q1378429'>Eurydice</prn> the wife of <prn id='Q82732'>Aeneas</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.26.2'><b>10.26.2</b> Beyond these are painted on a couch <prn id='Q16327026'>Deinome</prn>, <prn id='Q91121083'>Metioche</prn>, <prn id='Q115575522'>Peisis</prn> and <prn id='Q115575542'>Cleodice</prn>. Deinome is the only one of these names to occur in what is called the <prn id='Q2087365'>Little Iliad</prn>; <prn id='Q182855'>Polygnotus</prn>, I think, invented the names of the others. <prn id='Q278930'>Epeius</prn> is painted naked; he is razing to the ground the <pl id='Q22647'>Trojan</pl> wall. Above the wall rises the head only of the <prn id='Q50193'>Wooden Horse</prn>. There is <prn id='Q2103073'>Polypoetes</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q502156'>Peirithous</prn>, his head bound with a fillet; by his side is <prn id='Q348668'>Acamas</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>, wearing on his head a helmet with a crest on it. </p>
<p id='10.26.3'><b>10.26.3</b> There is also <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn> . . . and <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn> has put on his corselet. <prn id='Q242319'>Ajax</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q975447'>Oileus</prn>, holding a shield, stands by an altar, taking an oath about the outrage on <prn id='Q170779'>Cassandra</prn>. <prn id='Q170779'>Cassandra</prn> is sitting on the ground, and holds the image of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, for she had knocked over the wooden image from its stand when <prn id='Q242319'>Ajax</prn> was dragging her away from sanctuary. In the painting are also the sons of <prn id='Q192469'>Atreus</prn>, wearing helmets like the others; <prn id='Q171839'>Menelaus</prn> carries a shield, on which is wrought a <prn id='Q2102'>serpent</prn> as a memorial of the prodigy that appeared on the victims at <pl id='Q2612265'>Aulis</pl>. </p>
<p id='10.26.4'><b>10.26.4</b> Under those who are administering the oath to <prn id='Q242319'>Ajax</prn>, and in a line with the <prn id='Q726'>horse</prn> by <prn id='Q193267'>Nestor</prn>, is <prn id='Q322639'>Neoptolemus</prn>, who has killed <prn id='Q12872396'>Elasus</prn>, whoever <prn id='Q12872396'>Elasus</prn> may be. <prn id='Q12872396'>Elasus</prn> is represented as a man only just alive. <prn id='Q55855535'>Astynous</prn>, who is also mentioned by <prn id='Q2486846'>Lescheos</prn>, has fallen to his knees, and <prn id='Q322639'>Neoptolemus</prn> is striking him with a sword. <prn id='Q322639'>Neoptolemus</prn> is the only one of the Greek army represented by <prn id='Q182855'>Polygnotus</prn> as still killing the <pl id='Q22647'>Trojans</pl>, the reason being that he intended the whole painting to be placed over the grave of <prn id='Q322639'>Neoptolemus</prn>. The son of <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn> is named <prn id='Q322639'>Neoptolemus</prn> by <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> in all his poetry. The epic poem, however, called <prn id='Q1075630'>Cypria</prn> says that <prn id='Q15262316'>Lycomedes</prn> named him <prn id='Q322639'>Pyrrhus</prn>, but <prn id='Q1061747'>Phoenix</prn> gave him the name of <prn id='Q322639'>Neoptolemus</prn> (young soldier) because <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn> was but young when he first went to war. </p>
<p id='10.26.5'><b>10.26.5</b> In the picture is an altar, to which a small boy clings in terror. On the altar lies a bronze corselet. At the present day corselets of this form are rare, but they used to be worn in days of old. They were made of two bronze pieces, one fitting the chest and the parts about the belly, the other intended to protect the back. They were called gyala. One was put on in front, and the other behind; then they were fastened together by buckles. </p>
<p id='10.26.6'><b>10.26.6</b> They were thought to afford sufficient safety even without a shield. Wherefore <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> speaks of <prn id='Q3381470'>Phorcys</prn> the <pl id='Q32579'>Phrygian</pl> as without a shield, because he wore a two-piece corselet. Not only have I seen this armour depicted by <prn id='Q182855'>Polygnotus</prn>, but in the temple of <pl id='Q43018'>Ephesian</pl> <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, <prn id='Q718124'>Calliphon</prn> of <pl id='Q13580795'>Samos</pl> has painted women fitting on the gyala of the corselet of <prn id='Q186271'>Patroclus</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.26.7'><b>10.26.7</b> Beyond the altar he has painted <prn id='Q1178583'>Laodice</prn> standing, whom I do not find among the <pl id='Q22647'>Trojan</pl> captive women enumerated by any poet, so I think that the only probable conclusion is that she was set free by the Greeks. <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> in the <prn id='Q8275'>Iliad</prn> speaks of the hospitality given to <prn id='Q171839'>Menelaus</prn> and <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn> by <prn id='Q571969'>Antenor</prn>, and how <prn id='Q1178583'>Laodice</prn> was wife to <prn id='Q2317917'>Helicaon</prn>, <prn id='Q571969'>Antenor</prn>'s son. </p>
<p id='10.26.8'><b>10.26.8</b> <prn id='Q2486846'>Lescheos</prn> says that <prn id='Q2317917'>Helicaon</prn>, wounded in the night battle, was recognized by <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn> and carried alive out of the fighting. So the tie binding <prn id='Q171839'>Menelaus</prn> and <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn> to the house of <prn id='Q571969'>Antenor</prn> makes it unlikely that <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn> and <prn id='Q171839'>Menelaus</prn> committed any spiteful act against the wife of <prn id='Q2317917'>Helicaon</prn>. The account of <prn id='Q1178583'>Laodice</prn> given by the <pl id='Q21235810'>Chalcidian</pl> poet <prn id='Q921175'>Euphorion</prn> is entirely unlikely. </p>
<p id='10.26.9'><b>10.26.9</b> Next to <prn id='Q1178583'>Laodice</prn> is a stone stand with a bronze washing-basin upon it. <prn id='Q91121889'>Medusa</prn> is sitting on the ground, holding the stand in both hands. If we are to believe the ode of the poet of <pl id='Q1111219'>Himera</pl>, <prn id='Q91121889'>Medusa</prn> should be reckoned as one of the daughters of <prn id='Q170473'>Priam</prn>. Beside <prn id='Q91121889'>Medusa</prn> is a shaved old woman or eunuch, holding on the knees a naked child. It is represented as holding its hand before its eyes in terror. </p>
<p id='10.27.1'><b>10.27.1</b> There are also corpses: the naked man, <prn id='Q91121890'>Pelis</prn> by name, lies thrown on his back, and under <prn id='Q91121890'>Pelis</prn> lie <prn id='Q91121892'>Eioneus</prn> and <prn id='Q91121089'>Admetus</prn>, still clad in their corselets.

Above these are others: under the washing-basin is <prn id='Q91121893'>Leocritus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q91121087'>Polydamas</prn>, killed by <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn>; beyond <prn id='Q91121892'>Eioneus</prn> and <prn id='Q91121089'>Admetus</prn> is <prn id='Q1784620'>Coroebus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q1647552'>Mygdon</prn>. Of <prn id='Q1647552'>Mygdon</prn> there is a notable tomb on the borders of the <pl id='Q32579'>Phrygians</pl> of Stectorion, and after him poets are wont to call <pl id='Q32579'>Phrygians</pl> by the name of <pl id='Q639861'>Mygdones</pl>. <prn id='Q1784620'>Coroebus</prn> came to marry <prn id='Q170779'>Cassandra</prn>, and was killed, according to the more popular account, by <prn id='Q322639'>Neoptolemus</prn>, but according to the poet <prn id='Q2486846'>Lescheos</prn>, by <prn id='Q208256'>Diomedes</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.27.2'><b>10.27.2</b> Higher up than <prn id='Q1784620'>Coroebus</prn> are <prn id='Q170473'>Priam</prn>, <prn id='Q55996294'>Axion</prn> and <prn id='Q2547185'>Agenor</prn>. <prn id='Q2486846'>Lescheos</prn> says that <prn id='Q170473'>Priam</prn> was not killed at the altar (eschara) of <prn id='Q103020456'>Herkeios</prn>, but that he was dragged away from the altar and fell an easy prey to <prn id='Q322639'>Neoptolemus</prn> at the gate of his own palace. As to <prn id='Q193433'>Hecuba</prn>, <prn id='Q332797'>Stesichorus</prn> says in the <prn id='Q1627579'>Iliupersis</prn> that she was brought by <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> to <pl id='Q18927'>Lycia</pl>. <prn id='Q2486846'>Lescheos</prn> says that <prn id='Q55996294'>Axion</prn> was a son of <prn id='Q170473'>Priam</prn>, killed by <prn id='Q1588440'>Eurypylus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q3735337'>Euaemon</prn>. According to the same poet <prn id='Q2547185'>Agenor</prn> was slain by <prn id='Q322639'>Neoptolemus</prn>. So it would appear that <prn id='Q667189'>Echeclus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q2547185'>Agenor</prn> was slaughtered by <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn>, and <prn id='Q2547185'>Agenor</prn> himself by <prn id='Q322639'>Neoptolemus</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.27.3'><b>10.27.3</b> The body of <prn id='Q91121094'>Laomedon</prn> is being carried off by <prn id='Q663792'>Sinon</prn>, a comrade of <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn>, and <prn id='Q21548605'>Anchialus</prn>. There is also in the painting another corpse, that of <prn id='Q91121895'>Eresus</prn>. The tale of <prn id='Q91121895'>Eresus</prn> and <prn id='Q91121094'>Laomedon</prn>, so far as we know, no poet has sung. There is the house of <prn id='Q571969'>Antenor</prn>, with a leopard's skin hanging over the entrance, as a sign to the Greeks to keep their hands off the home of <prn id='Q571969'>Antenor</prn>. There are painted <prn id='Q1154473'>Theano</prn> and her sons, <prn id='Q91121091'>Glaucus</prn> sitting on a corselet fitted with the two pieces, and <prn id='Q19946249'>Eurymachus</prn> upon a rock. </p>
<p id='10.27.4'><b>10.27.4</b> By the latter stands <prn id='Q571969'>Antenor</prn>, and next to him <prn id='Q16330878'>Crino</prn>, a daughter of <prn id='Q571969'>Antenor</prn>. <prn id='Q16330878'>Crino</prn> is carrying a baby. The look upon their faces is that of those on whom a calamity has fallen. Servants are loading an <prn id='Q19707'>ass</prn> with a chest and other furniture. There is also sitting on the <prn id='Q19707'>ass</prn> a small child. At this part of the painting there is also an elegiac couplet of <prn id='Q273003'>Simonides</prn>: <br>“<prn id='Q182855'>Polygnotus</prn>, a <pl id='Q2409204'>Thasian</pl> by birth, son of <prn id='Q1454839'>Aglaophon</prn>, <br>Painted a picture of <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl>'s acropolis being sacked.” </p>
<p id='10.28.1'><b>10.28.1</b> The other part of the picture, the one on the left, shows <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn>, who has descended into what is called <prn id='Q41410'>Hades</prn> to inquire of the soul of <prn id='Q656881'>Teiresias</prn> about his safe return home. The objects depicted are as follow. There is water like a river, clearly intended for <pl id='Q191087'>Acheron</pl>, with reeds growing in it; the forms of the fishes appear so dim that you will take them to be shadows rather than fish. On the river is a boat, with the ferryman at the oars. </p>
<p id='10.28.2'><b>10.28.2</b> <prn id='Q182855'>Polygnotus</prn> followed, I think, the poem called the <prn id='Q6871244'>Minyad</prn>. For in this poem occur lines referring to <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> and <prn id='Q502156'>Peirithous</prn>: <br>“Then the boat on which embark the dead, that the old ferryman, <prn id='Q6612'>Charon</prn>, used to steer, they found not within its moorings.” <br>For this reason then <prn id='Q182855'>Polygnotus</prn> too painted <prn id='Q6612'>Charon</prn> as a man well stricken in years. </p>
<p id='10.28.3'><b>10.28.3</b> Those on board the boat are not altogether distinguished. Tellis1 appears as a youth in years, and <prn id='Q91121888'>Cleoboea</prn> as still a maiden, holding on her knees a chest such as they are wont to make for <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>. All I heard about Tellis1 was that <prn id='Q201323'>Archilochus</prn> the poet was his grandson, while as for <prn id='Q91121888'>Cleoboea</prn>, they say that she was the first to bring the orgies of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> to <pl id='Q2409204'>Thasos</pl> from <pl id='Q65040323'>Paros</pl>. </p>
<p id='10.28.4'><b>10.28.4</b> On the bank of <pl id='Q191087'>Acheron</pl> there is a notable group under the boat of <prn id='Q6612'>Charon</prn>, consisting of a man who had been undutiful to his father and is now being throttled by him. For the men of old held their parents in the greatest respect, as we may infer, among other instances, from those in Catana called the Pious, who, when the fire flowed down on Catana from <pl id='Q16990'>Aetna</pl>, held of no account gold or silver, but when they fled took up, one his mother and another his father. As they struggled on, the fire rushed up and caught them in the flames. Not even so would they put down their parents, and it is said that the stream of lava divided itself in two, and the fire passed on, doing no hurt to either young men or their parents. </p>
<p id='10.28.5'><b>10.28.5</b> These Catanians even at the present day receive honors from their fellow countrymen. Near to the man in <prn id='Q182855'>Polygnotus</prn>' picture who maltreated his father and for this drinks his cup of woe in <pl id='Q1521549'>Hades</pl>, is a man who paid the penalty for sacrilege. The woman who is punishing him is skilled in poisonous and other drugs. </p>
<p id='10.28.6'><b>10.28.6</b> So it appears that in those days men laid the greatest stress on piety to the gods, as the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> showed when they took the sanctuary of <prn id='Q106460486'>Olympian</prn> <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> at <pl id='Q4420718'>Syracuse</pl>; they moved none of the offerings, but left the <pl id='Q4420718'>Syracusan</pl> priest as their keeper. <prn id='Q41328'>Datis</prn> the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl> too showed his piety in his address to the <pl id='Q173148'>Delians</pl>, and in this act as well, when having found an image of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> in a <pl id='Q41642'>Phoenician</pl> ship he restored it to the <pl id='Q56259452'>Tanagraeans</pl> at <pl id='Q1184284'>Delium</pl>. So at that time all men held the divine in reverence, and this is why <prn id='Q182855'>Polygnotus</prn> has depicted the punishment of him who committed sacrilege. </p>
<p id='10.28.7'><b>10.28.7</b> Higher up than the figures I have enumerated comes <prn id='Q1378534'>Eurynomus</prn>, said by the <pl id='Q682558'>Delphian</pl> guides to be one of the demons in <pl id='Q1521549'>Hades</pl>, who eats off all the flesh of the corpses, leaving only their bones. But <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>'s <prn id='Q35160'>Odyssey</prn>, the poem called the <prn id='Q6871244'>Minyad</prn>, and the <prn id='Q1999875'>Returns</prn>, although they tell of <prn id='Q41410'>Hades</prn>, and its horrors, know of no demon called <prn id='Q1378534'>Eurynomus</prn>. However, I will describe what he is like and his attitude in the painting. He is of a color between blue and black, like that of meat flies; he is showing his teeth and is seated, and under him is spread a vulture's skin. </p>
<p id='10.28.8'><b>10.28.8</b> Next after <prn id='Q1378534'>Eurynomus</prn> are <prn id='Q760213'>Auge</prn> of <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl> and <prn id='Q1672201'>Iphimedeia</prn>. <prn id='Q760213'>Auge</prn> visited the house of <prn id='Q1395752'>Teuthras</prn> in <pl id='Q622319'>Mysia</pl>, and of all the women with whom <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn> is said to have mated, none gave birth to a son more like his father than she did. Great honors are paid to <prn id='Q1672201'>Iphimedeia</prn> by the <pl id='Q193214'>Carians</pl> in <pl id='Q3857824'>Mylasa</pl>. </p>
<p id='10.29.1'><b>10.29.1</b> Higher up than the figures I have already enumerated are <prn id='Q28071156'>Perimedes</prn> and <prn id='Q993387'>Eurylochus</prn>, the companions of <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn>, carrying victims for sacrifice; these are black rams. After them is a man seated, said by the inscription to be <prn id='Q1929263'>Ocnus</prn> (Sloth). He is depicted as plaiting a cord, and by him stands a she-<prn id='Q19707'>ass</prn>, eating up the cord as quickly as it is plaited. They say that this <prn id='Q1929263'>Ocnus</prn> was a diligent man with an extravagant wife. Everything he earned by working was quickly spent by his wife. </p>
<p id='10.29.2'><b>10.29.2</b> So they will have it that <prn id='Q182855'>Polygnotus</prn> has painted a parable about the wife of <prn id='Q1929263'>Ocnus</prn>. I know also that the <prn id='Q465331'>Ionians</prn>, whenever they see a man labouring at nothing profitable, say that such an one is plaiting the cord of <prn id='Q1929263'>Ocnus</prn>. Ocnus too is the name given to a bird by the seers who observe birds that are ominous. This Ocnus is the largest and most beautiful of the herons, a rare bird if ever there was one. </p>
<p id='10.29.3'><b>10.29.3</b> <prn id='Q656887'>Tityos</prn> too is in the picture; he is no longer being punished, but has been reduced to nothing by continuous torture, an indistinct and mutilated phantom. Going on to the next part of the picture, you see very near to the man who is twisting the rope a painting of <prn id='Q184874'>Ariadne</prn>. Seated on a rock she is looking at her sister <prn id='Q212818'>Phaedra</prn>, who is on a swing grasping in either hand the rope on each side. The attitude, though quite gracefully drawn, makes us infer the manner of <prn id='Q212818'>Phaedra</prn>'s death. </p>
<p id='10.29.4'><b>10.29.4</b> <prn id='Q184874'>Ariadne</prn> was taken away from <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> by <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>, who sailed against him with superior forces, and either fell in with <prn id='Q184874'>Ariadne</prn> by chance or else set an ambush to catch her. This <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> was, in my opinion, none other than he who was the first to invade <pl id='Q17055962'>India</pl>, and the first to bridge the river <pl id='Q34589'>Euphrates</pl>. <pl id='Q196987'>Zeugma</pl> (Yoking) was the name given to that part of the country where the <pl id='Q34589'>Euphrates</pl> was bridged, and at the present day the cable is still preserved with which he spanned the river; it is plaited with branches of the vine and ivy. </p>
<p id='10.29.5'><b>10.29.5</b> Both the Greeks and the <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptians</pl> have many legends about <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>. Underneath <prn id='Q212818'>Phaedra</prn> is <prn id='Q1075260'>Chloris</prn> leaning against the knees of <prn id='Q949266'>Thyia</prn>. He will not be mistaken who says that all during the lives of these women they remained friends. For <prn id='Q1075260'>Chloris</prn> came from <pl id='Q543895'>Orchomenus</pl> in <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl>, and the other was a daughter of <prn id='Q56936702'>Castalius</prn> from <pl id='Q105261'>Parnassus</pl>. Other authorities have told their history, how that <prn id='Q949266'>Thyia</prn> had connection with <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, and how <prn id='Q1075260'>Chloris</prn> wedded <prn id='Q637955'>Neleus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.29.6'><b>10.29.6</b> Beside <prn id='Q949266'>Thyia</prn> stands <prn id='Q1139470'>Procris</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q301219'>Erechtheus</prn>, and after her <prn id='Q2980441'>Clymene</prn>, who is turning her back to <prn id='Q1075260'>Chloris</prn>. The poem the <prn id='Q1999875'>Returns</prn> says that <prn id='Q2980441'>Clymene</prn> was a daughter of <prn id='Q6871244'>Minyas</prn>, that she married <prn id='Q643504'>Cephalus</prn> the son of <prn id='Q1183342'>Deion</prn>, and that a son <prn id='Q1525379'>Iphiclus</prn> was born to them. The story of <prn id='Q1139470'>Procris</prn> is told by all men, how she had married <prn id='Q643504'>Cephalus</prn> before <prn id='Q2980441'>Clymene</prn>, and in what way she was put to death by her husband. </p>
<p id='10.29.7'><b>10.29.7</b> Farther within from <prn id='Q2980441'>Clymene</prn> you will see <prn id='Q929768'>Megara</prn> from <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>. This <prn id='Q929768'>Megara</prn> married <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, but was divorced by him in course of time, on the ground that he had lost the children he had by her, and so thought that his marriage with her was unlucky. Above the heads of the women I have enumerated is the <prn id='Q1126715'>daughter</prn> of <prn id='Q1131643'>Salmoneus</prn> sitting on a rock, beside whom is standing <prn id='Q1125040'>Eriphyle</prn>, who is holding up the ends of her fingers along her neck through her tunic, and you will conjecture that in the folds of her tunic she is holding in one of her hands the famous necklace. </p>
<p id='10.29.8'><b>10.29.8</b> Beyond <prn id='Q1125040'>Eriphyle</prn> have been painted <prn id='Q935433'>Elpenor</prn> and <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn>. The latter is squatting on his feet, and holding his sword over the trench, towards which the seer <prn id='Q656881'>Teiresias</prn> is advancing. After <prn id='Q656881'>Teiresias</prn> is <prn id='Q576170'>Anticleia</prn>, the mother of <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn>, upon a rock. <prn id='Q935433'>Elpenor</prn> has on instead of clothes a mat, such as is usual for sailors to wear. </p>
<p id='10.29.9'><b>10.29.9</b> Lower down than <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn> are <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> and <prn id='Q502156'>Peirithous</prn> sitting upon chairs. The former is holding in his hands the sword of <prn id='Q502156'>Peirithous</prn> and his own. <prn id='Q502156'>Peirithous</prn> is looking at the swords, and you might conjecture that he is angry with them for having been useless and of no help in their daring adventures. <prn id='Q983680'>Panyassis</prn> the poet says that <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> and <prn id='Q502156'>Peirithous</prn> did not sit chained to their chairs, but that the rock grew to their flesh and so served as chains. </p>
<p id='10.29.10'><b>10.29.10</b> The proverbial friendship of <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> and <prn id='Q502156'>Peirithous</prn> has been mentioned by <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> in both his poems. In the <prn id='Q35160'>Odyssey</prn> <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn> says to the <prn id='Q128693'>Phaeacians</prn>: “And now I should have seen more men of former days, whom I wished very much to see, <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn> and <prn id='Q502156'>Peirithous</prn>, renowned children of gods.” And in the <prn id='Q8275'>Iliad</prn> he has made <prn id='Q193267'>Nestor</prn> give advice to <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn> and <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn>, and speaking among others the following verses: “I have never yet seen such men, and I am never likely to see As were <prn id='Q502156'>Peirithous</prn>, <prn id='Q91110342'>Dryas</prn>, shepherd of the folk, <prn id='Q1132772'>Caeneus</prn>, Exadius, god-like <prn id='Q193567'>Polyphemus</prn>, and <prn id='Q1320718'>Theseus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q191725'>Aegeus</prn>, like to the immortals.” </p>
<p id='10.30.1'><b>10.30.1</b> Next <prn id='Q182855'>Polygnotus</prn> has painted the daughters of <prn id='Q1428276'>Pandareos</prn>. <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> makes <prn id='Q165769'>Penelope</prn> say in a speech that the parents of the maidens died because of the wrath of the gods, that they were reared as orphans by <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> and received gifts from other goddesses: from <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> wisdom and beauty of form, from <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> high stature, from <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> schooling in the works that befit women. </p>
<p id='10.30.2'><b>10.30.2</b> He goes on to say that <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> ascended into heaven, wishing to secure for the girls a happy marriage, and in her absence they were carried off by the <prn id='Q181360'>Harpies</prn> and given by them to the <prn id='Q180262'>Furies</prn>. This is the story as given by <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>. <prn id='Q182855'>Polygnotus</prn> has painted them as girls crowned with flowers and playing with dice, and gives them the names of <prn id='Q21051033'>Cameiro</prn> and <prn id='Q4223977'>Clytie</prn>. I must tell you that <prn id='Q1428276'>Pandareos</prn> was a <pl id='Q17325188'>Milesian</pl> from <pl id='Q17325188'>Miletus</pl> in <pl id='Q4752820'>Crete</pl>, and implicated in the theft of <prn id='Q182101'>Tantalus</prn> and in the trick of the oath. </p>

Such is the posture of <prn id='Q871361'>Protesilaus</prn>, and beyond <prn id='Q41746'>Achilles</prn> is <prn id='Q186271'>Patroclus</prn> standing. With the exception of <prn id='Q128176'>Agamemnon</prn> these figures have no beard. </p>
<p id='10.30.4'><b>10.30.4</b> Beyond them has been painted <prn id='Q836311'>Phocus</prn> as a stripling, and <prn id='Q106345251'>Iaseus</prn>, well bearded, is taking off a ring from the left hand of <prn id='Q836311'>Phocus</prn>. The story about this is as follows. When <prn id='Q836311'>Phocus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q206187'>Aeacus</prn>, had crossed from <pl id='Q191082'>Aegina</pl> into what is now called <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl>, and wished to gain the rule over the men living on that part of the mainland, and to settle there himself, <prn id='Q106345251'>Iaseus</prn> conceived a great friendship for him. Among the gifts that <prn id='Q106345251'>Iaseus</prn> gave (as friends will) was a seal-ring, a stone set in gold. But when <prn id='Q836311'>Phocus</prn> returned, not long afterwards, to <pl id='Q191082'>Aegina</pl>, <prn id='Q178641'>Peleus</prn> at once plotted to kill him. This is the reason why in the painting, as a reminder of their great friendship, <prn id='Q106345251'>Iaseus</prn> is anxious to look at the ring and <prn id='Q836311'>Phocus</prn> has let him take it. </p>
<p id='10.30.5'><b>10.30.5</b> Beyond these is <prn id='Q2002158'>Maera</prn> sitting on a rock. About her the poem <prn id='Q1999875'>Returns</prn> says that she was still a maid when she departed this life, being the daughter of <prn id='Q108911095'>Proetus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q10380878'>Thersander</prn>, who was a son of <prn id='Q102561'>Sisyphus</prn>. Next to <prn id='Q2002158'>Maera</prn> is <prn id='Q208531'>Actaeon</prn>, son of <prn id='Q392435'>Aristaeus</prn>, together with the mother of <prn id='Q208531'>Actaeon</prn>; they hold in their hands a young deer, and are sitting on a deer's skin. A hunting <prn id='Q144'>dog</prn> lies stretched out beside them, an allusion to <prn id='Q208531'>Actaeon</prn>'s mode of life, and to the manner of his death. </p>
<p id='10.30.6'><b>10.30.6</b> Turning our gaze again to the lower part of the picture we see, next after <prn id='Q186271'>Patroclus</prn>, <prn id='Q174353'>Orpheus</prn> sitting on what seems to be a sort of hill; he grasps with his left hand a harp, and with his right he touches a willow. It is the branches that he touches, and he is leaning against the tree. The grove seems to be that of <prn id='Q45967'>Persephone</prn>, where grow, as <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> thought, black poplars and willows. The appearance of <prn id='Q174353'>Orpheus</prn> is Greek, and neither his garb nor his head-gear is Thracian. </p>
<p id='10.30.7'><b>10.30.7</b> On the other side of the willow-tree PromedonYY is leaning against it. Some there are who think that the name PromedonYY is as it were a poetic invention of <prn id='Q182855'>Polygnotus</prn>; others have said that PromedonYY was a Greek who was fond of listening to all kinds of music, especially to the singing of <prn id='Q174353'>Orpheus</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.30.8'><b>10.30.8</b> In this part of the painting is <prn id='Q17282472'>Schedius</prn>, who led the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> to <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl>, and after him is <prn id='Q182439'>Pelias</prn>, sitting on a chair, with grey hair and grey beard, and looking at <prn id='Q174353'>Orpheus</prn>. <prn id='Q17282472'>Schedius</prn> holds a dagger and is crowned with grass. <prn id='Q853014'>Thamyris</prn> is sitting near <prn id='Q182439'>Pelias</prn>. He has lost the sight of his eyes; his attitude is one of utter dejection; his hair and beard are long; at his feet lies thrown a lyre with its horns and strings broken. </p>
<p id='10.30.9'><b>10.30.9</b> Above him is <prn id='Q599737'>Marsyas</prn>, sitting on a rock, and by his side is <prn id='Q290144'>Olympus</prn>, with the appearance of a boy in the bloom of youth learning to play the flute. The <pl id='Q32579'>Phrygians</pl> in <pl id='Q617518'>Celaenae</pl> hold that the river passing through the city was once this great flute-player, and they also hold that the Song of the Mother, an air for the flute, was composed by <prn id='Q599737'>Marsyas</prn>. They say too that they repelled the army of the Gauls by the aid of <prn id='Q599737'>Marsyas</prn>, who defended them against the barbarians by the water from the river and by the music of his flute. </p>
<p id='10.31.1'><b>10.31.1</b> If you turn your gaze again to the upper part of the painting, you see, next to <prn id='Q208531'>Actaeon</prn>, <prn id='Q172725'>Ajax</prn> of <pl id='Q202422'>Salamis</pl>, and also <prn id='Q252387'>Palamedes</prn> and <prn id='Q1045730'>Thersites</prn> playing with dice, the invention of <prn id='Q252387'>Palamedes</prn>; the other <prn id='Q242319'>Ajax</prn> is looking at them as they play. The color of the latter <prn id='Q242319'>Ajax</prn> is like that of a shipwrecked sailor with the brine still rough on the surface of his skin. </p>
<p id='10.31.2'><b>10.31.2</b> <prn id='Q182855'>Polygnotus</prn> has intentionally gathered into one group the enemies of <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn>. <prn id='Q242319'>Ajax</prn>, son of <prn id='Q975447'>Oileus</prn>, conceived a hatred of <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn>, because <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn> urged the Greeks to stone him for the outrage on <prn id='Q170779'>Cassandra</prn>. <prn id='Q252387'>Palamedes</prn>, as I know from reading the epic poem <prn id='Q1075630'>Cypria</prn>, was drowned when he put out to catch fish, and his murderers were <prn id='Q208256'>Diomedes</prn> and <prn id='Q47231'>Odysseus</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.31.3'><b>10.31.3</b> <prn id='Q321541'>Meleager</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q749966'>Oeneus</prn>, is higher up in the picture than <prn id='Q242319'>Ajax</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q975447'>Oileus</prn>, and he seems to be looking at <prn id='Q242319'>Ajax</prn>. <prn id='Q252387'>Palamedes</prn> has no beard, but the others have. As to the death of <prn id='Q321541'>Meleager</prn>, <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> says that the <prn id='Q180262'>Fury</prn> heard the curses of <prn id='Q440440'>Althaea</prn>, and that this was the cause of <prn id='Q321541'>Meleager</prn>'s death. But the poem <prn id='Q1233074'>Eoeae</prn>, as it is called, and the <prn id='Q6871244'>Minyad</prn> agree in giving a different account. For these poems say that <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> helped the <prn id='Q247617'>Curetes</prn> against the <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolians</pl>, and that <prn id='Q321541'>Meleager</prn> was killed by <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.31.4'><b>10.31.4</b> The story about the brand, how it was given by the <prn id='Q180287'>Fates</prn> to <prn id='Q440440'>Althaea</prn>, how <prn id='Q321541'>Meleager</prn> was not to die before the brand was consumed by fire, and how <prn id='Q440440'>Althaea</prn> burnt it up in a passion — this story was first made the subject of a drama by <prn id='Q317061'>Phrynichus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q91109172'>Polyphradmon</prn>, in his <pl id='Q45793176'>Pleuronian</pl> Women: <br>“For chill doom he escaped not, but a swift flame consumed him, <br>as the brand was destroyed by his terrible mother, contriver of evil.” <br>However, it appears that <prn id='Q317061'>Phrynichus</prn> did not elaborate the story as a man would his own invention, but only touched on it as one already in the mouths of everybody in Greece. </p>
<p id='10.31.5'><b>10.31.5</b> In the lower part of the picture, after the Thracian <prn id='Q853014'>Thamyris</prn>, comes <prn id='Q159666'>Hector</prn>, who is sitting with both hands clasped about his left knee, in an attitude of deep grief. After him is <prn id='Q506781'>Memnon</prn>, sitting on a rock, and <prn id='Q762520'>Sarpedon</prn> next to <prn id='Q506781'>Memnon</prn>. <prn id='Q762520'>Sarpedon</prn> has his face buried in both hands, and one of <prn id='Q506781'>Memnon</prn>'s hands lies on <prn id='Q762520'>Sarpedon</prn>'s shoulder. </p>
<p id='10.31.6'><b>10.31.6</b> All are bearded; and on the cloak of <prn id='Q506781'>Memnon</prn> are embroidered birds. Their name is Memnonides, and the people of the <pl id='Q6514'>Hellespont</pl> say that on stated days every year they go to the grave of <prn id='Q506781'>Memnon</prn>, and sweep all that part of the tomb that is bare of trees or grass, and sprinkle it with the water of the <pl id='Q252710'>Aesepus</pl> from their wet wings. </p>
<p id='10.31.7'><b>10.31.7</b> Beside <prn id='Q506781'>Memnon</prn> is depicted a naked Ethiopian boy, because <prn id='Q506781'>Memnon</prn> was king of the Ethiopian nation. He came to <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl>, however, not from <pl id='Q410453'>Ethiopia</pl>, but from <pl id='Q180773'>Susa</pl> in <pl id='Q3746183'>Persia</pl> and from the river <prn id='Q1472376'>Choaspes</prn>, having subdued all the peoples that lived between these and <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl>. The <pl id='Q32579'>Phrygians</pl> still point out the road through which he led his army, picking out the shortest routes. The road is divided up by halting-places. </p>
<p id='10.31.8'><b>10.31.8</b> Beyond <prn id='Q762520'>Sarpedon</prn> and <prn id='Q506781'>Memnon</prn> is <prn id='Q167646'>Paris</prn>, as yet beardless. He is clapping his hands like a boor, and you will say that it is as though <prn id='Q167646'>Paris</prn> were calling <prn id='Q379828'>Penthesileia</prn> to him by the noise of his hands. <prn id='Q379828'>Penthesileia</prn> too is there, looking at <prn id='Q167646'>Paris</prn>, but by the toss of her head she seems to show her disdain and contempt. In appearance <prn id='Q379828'>Penthesileia</prn> is a maiden, carrying a bow like <pl id='Q845909'>Scythian</pl> bows, and wearing a leopard's skin on her shoulders. </p>
<p id='10.31.9'><b>10.31.9</b> The women beyond <prn id='Q379828'>Penthesileia</prn> are carrying water in broken pitchers; one is depicted as in the bloom of youth, the other is already advanced in years. There is no separate inscription on either woman, but there is one common to the pair, which states that they are of the number of the uninitiated. </p>
<p id='10.31.10'><b>10.31.10</b> Higher up than these is <prn id='Q203673'>Callisto</prn>, daughter of <prn id='Q501667'>Lycaon</prn>, <prn id='Q3621995'>Nomia</prn>, and <prn id='Q281670'>Pero</prn>, daughter of <prn id='Q637955'>Neleus</prn>. As her bride-price <prn id='Q637955'>Neleus</prn> asked for the <prn id='Q473194'>oxen</prn> of <prn id='Q738862'>Iphiclus</prn>. Instead of a mattress, <prn id='Q203673'>Callisto</prn> has a bearskin, and her feet are lying on <prn id='Q3621995'>Nomia</prn>'s knees. I have already mentioned that the <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadians</pl> say that <prn id='Q3621995'>Nomia</prn> is a nymph native to their country. The poets say that the nymphs live for a great number of years, but are not altogether exempt from death. After <prn id='Q203673'>Callisto</prn> and the women with her is the form of a cliff, and <prn id='Q102561'>Sisyphus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q406388'>Aeolus</prn>, is trying his hardest to push the rock up it. </p>
<p id='10.31.11'><b>10.31.11</b> There is also in the painting a jar, and an old man, with a boy and two women. One of these, who is young, is under the rock; the other is beside the old man and of a like age to his. The others are carrying water, but you will guess that the old woman's water-jar is broken. All that remains of the water in the sherd she is pouring out again into the jar. We inferred that these people too were of those who had held of no account the rites at <pl id='Q94299853'>Eleusis</pl>. For the Greeks of an earlier period looked upon the <prn id='Q26314'>Eleusinian mysteries</prn> as being as much higher than all other religious acts as gods are higher than heroes. </p>
<p id='10.31.12'><b>10.31.12</b> Under this jar is <prn id='Q182101'>Tantalus</prn>, enduring all the pains that <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> speaks of, and in addition the terror of the stone that hangs over him. <prn id='Q182855'>Polygnotus</prn> has plainly followed the account of <prn id='Q201323'>Archilochus</prn>, but I do not know whether <prn id='Q201323'>Archilochus</prn> borrowed from others the story of the stone or whether it was an invention of his that he introduced into his poem. So great is the number of the figures and so many are their beauties, in this painting of the <pl id='Q2409204'>Thasian</pl> artist. </p>
<p id='10.32.1'><b>10.32.1</b> Adjoining the sacred enclosure is a <pl id='Q10378966'>theater</pl> worth seeing, and on coming up from the enclosure...and here is an image of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>, dedicated by the <pl id='Q690575'>Cnidians</pl>. The <pl id='Q21705214'>stadium</pl> is on the highest part of their city. It was made of the stone that is most common about <pl id='Q105261'>Parnassus</pl>, until <prn id='Q311879'>Herodes</prn> the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> rebuilt it of <pl id='Q1125206'>Pentelic</pl> marble. Such in my day the objects remaining in <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> that are worth recording. </p>
<p id='10.32.2'><b>10.32.2</b> On the way from <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> to the summit of <pl id='Q105261'>Parnassus</pl>, about sixty stades distant from <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>, there is a bronze image. The ascent to the <pl id='Q2261709'>Corycian cave</pl> is easier for an active walker than it is for mules or <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn>. I mentioned a little earlier in my narrative that this cave was named after a nymph called <prn id='Q520551'>Corycia</prn>, and of all the caves I have ever seen this seemed to me the best worth seeing. </p>
<p id='10.32.3'><b>10.32.3</b> It would be impossible to discover even the mere number of caves whose entrances face the beach or the deep sea, but the most famous ones in Greek or in foreign lands are the following. The <pl id='Q32579'>Phrygians</pl> on the river Pencelas, and those who came to this land originally from the <pl id='Q60791680'>Azanians</pl> in <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl>, show visitors a cave called Steunos, which is round, and handsome in its loftiness. It is sacred to the <prn id='Q334486'>Mother</prn>, and there is a cult statue of her. </p>
<p id='10.32.4'><b>10.32.4</b> <pl id='Q16327515'>Themisonium</pl> above <pl id='Q849709'>Laodiceia</pl> is also inhabited by <pl id='Q32579'>Phrygians</pl>. When the army of the Gauls was laying waste <pl id='Q620874'>Ionia</pl> and the borders of <pl id='Q620874'>Ionia</pl>, the <pl id='Q16327515'>Themisonians</pl> say that they were helped by <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> and <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn>, who revealed to their magistrates in dreams a cave, and commanded that in it should be hidden the <pl id='Q16327515'>Themisonians</pl> with their wives and children. </p>
<p id='10.32.5'><b>10.32.5</b> This is the reason why in front of the cave they have set up small images, called Spelaitai (gods of the cave), of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, <prn id='Q41484'>Hermes</prn> and <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>. The cave is some thirty stades distant from the city, and in it are springs of water. There is no entrance to it, the sunlight does not reach very far, and the greater part of the roof lies quite close to the floor. </p>
<p id='10.32.6'><b>10.32.6</b> There is also near <pl id='Q1432674'>Magnesia</pl> on the river Lethaeus a place called Aulae (Halls), where there is a cave sacred to <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, not very remarkable for its size, but the image of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> is very old indeed, and bestows strength equal to any task. The men sacred to the god leap down from sheer precipices and high rocks, and uprooting trees of exceeding height walk with their burdens down the narrowest of paths. </p>
<p id='10.32.7'><b>10.32.7</b> But the <pl id='Q2261709'>Corycian cave</pl> exceeds in size those I have mentioned, and it is possible to make one's way through the greater part of it even without lights. The roof stands at a sufficient height from the floor, and water, rising in part from springs but still more dripping from the roof, has made clearly visible the marks of drops on the floor throughout the cave. The dwellers around <pl id='Q105261'>Parnassus</pl> believe it to be sacred to the Corycian nymphs, and especially to <prn id='Q132582'>Pan</prn>. From the <pl id='Q2261709'>Corycian cave</pl> it is difficult even for an active walker to reach the heights of <pl id='Q105261'>Parnassus</pl>. The heights are above the clouds, and the <prn id='Q3526162'>Thyiad</prn> women rave there in honor of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn> and <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.32.8'><b>10.32.8</b> <pl id='Q56697763'>Tithorea</pl> is, I should guess, about one hundred and eighty stades distant from <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> on the road across <pl id='Q105261'>Parnassus</pl>. This road is not mountainous throughout, being fit even for vehicles, but was said to be several stades longer. I am aware that <prn id='Q26825'>Herodotus</prn> in his account of the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl> invasion gives the town a different name from that given to it in the oracles of <prn id='Q708459'>Bacis</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.32.9'><b>10.32.9</b> For <prn id='Q708459'>Bacis</prn> called the inhabitants <pl id='Q56697763'>Tithoreans</pl>, but the account of them in <prn id='Q26825'>Herodotus</prn> states that during the advance of the barbarian the people dwelling here fled up to the summit, and that the city's name was <pl id='Q56697763'>Neon</pl>, <pl id='Q56697763'>Tithorea</pl> being the name of the peak of <pl id='Q105261'>Parnassus</pl>. It appears, then, that at first <pl id='Q56697763'>Tithorea</pl> was the name applied to the whole district; but in course of time, when the people migrated from the villages, the city too came to be called <pl id='Q56697763'>Tithorea</pl>, and not <pl id='Q56697763'>Neon</pl> any longer. The natives say that <pl id='Q56697763'>Tithorea</pl> was so called after a <prn id='Q21616165'>nymph</prn> of the same name, one of those who in days of old, according to the story of the poets, grew out of trees and especially out of oaks. </p>
<p id='10.32.10'><b>10.32.10</b> One generation before I was born heaven made the fortunes of <pl id='Q56697763'>Tithorea</pl> decay. There are the buildings of a theater, and the enclosure of a rather ancient agora. The most noteworthy objects in the city are the grove, temple and image of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>. There is also the tomb of <prn id='Q461439'>Antiope</prn> and <prn id='Q3381352'>Phocus</prn>. I have already in my account of <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> mentioned how <prn id='Q461439'>Antiope</prn> went mad because of the wrath of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>, and the reason why she brought on herself the anger of the god; </p>
<p id='10.32.11'><b>10.32.11</b> I have also told how <prn id='Q3381352'>Phocus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q2031315'>Ornytion</prn>, fell in love with her, how she married him and is buried with him, and what <prn id='Q708459'>Bacis</prn> the soothsayer says about this grave in common with <pl id='Q106526021'>that</pl> of <prn id='Q196865'>Zethus</prn> and <prn id='Q242835'>Amphion</prn> at <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl>. I found nothing else remarkable in the town except what I have already mentioned. Running past the city of <pl id='Q56697763'>Tithorea</pl> is a river that gives the inhabitants drinking-water. They go down to the bank and draw the water up. The name of the river is Cachales. </p>
<p id='10.32.12'><b>10.32.12</b> Seventy stades distant from <pl id='Q56697763'>Tithorea</pl> is a temple of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>, called <prn id='Q55414238'>Archagetas</prn> (Founder). He receives divine honors from the <pl id='Q56697763'>Tithoreans</pl>, and no less from the other <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl>. Within the precincts are dwellings for both the suppliants of the god and his servants. In the middle is the temple of the god and an image made of stone, having a beard more than two feet long. A couch is set on the right of the image. It is usual to sacrifice to the god any animal except the <prn id='Q2934'>goat</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.32.13'><b>10.32.13</b> About forty stades distant from <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> is a precinct and shrine sacred to <prn id='Q79876'>Isis</prn>, the holiest of all those made by the Greeks for the <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptian</pl> goddess. For the <pl id='Q56697763'>Tithoreans</pl> think it wrong to dwell round about it, and no one may enter the shrine except those whom <prn id='Q79876'>Isis</prn> herself has honored by inviting them in dreams. The same rule is observed in the cities above the <pl id='Q211089'>Maeander</pl> by the gods of the lower world; for to all whom they wish to enter their shrines they send visions seen in dreams. </p>
<p id='10.32.14'><b>10.32.14</b> In the country of the <pl id='Q56697763'>Tithoreans</pl> a festival in honor of <prn id='Q79876'>Isis</prn> is held twice each year, one in spring and the other in autumn. On the third day before each of the feasts those who have permission to enter cleanse the shrine in a certain secret way, and also take and bury, always in the same spot, whatever remnants they may find [of the victims] thrown in at the previous festival. We estimated that the distance from the shrine to this place was two stades. </p>
<p id='10.32.15'><b>10.32.15</b> So on this day they perform these acts about the sanctuary, and on the next day the small traders make themselves booths of reeds or other improvised material. On the last of the three days they hold a fair, selling slaves, <prn id='Q830'>cattle</prn> of all kinds, clothes, silver and gold. </p>
<p id='10.32.16'><b>10.32.16</b> After mid-day they turn to sacrificing. The more wealthy sacrifice <prn id='Q473194'>oxen</prn> and deer, the poorer people geese and guinea fowl. But it is not the custom to use for the sacrifice <prn id='Q7368'>sheep</prn>, pigs or <prn id='Q2934'>goats</prn>. Those whose business it is to burn the victims and send them into the shrine . . . having made a beginning must wrap the victims in bandages of coarse or fine linen; the mode of preparing is the <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptian</pl>. </p>
<p id='10.32.17'><b>10.32.17</b> All that they have devoted to sacrifice are led in procession; some send the victims into the shrine, while others burn the booths before the shrine and themselves go away in haste. They say that once a profane man, who was not one of those descending into the shrine, when the pyre began to burn, entered the shrine to satisfy his rash inquisitiveness. It is said that everywhere he saw ghosts, and on returning to <pl id='Q56697763'>Tithorea</pl> and telling what he had seen he departed this life. </p>
<p id='10.32.18'><b>10.32.18</b> I have heard a similar story from a man of <pl id='Q41642'>Phoenicia</pl>, that the <pl id='Q11768'>Egyptians</pl> hold the feast for <prn id='Q79876'>Isis</prn> at a time when they say she is mourning for <prn id='Q46491'>Osiris</prn>. At this time the <pl id='Q3392'>Nile</pl> begins to rise, and it is a saying among many of the natives that what makes the river rise and water their fields is the tears of <prn id='Q79876'>Isis</prn>. At that time then, so said my <pl id='Q41642'>Phoenician</pl>, the Roman governor of <pl id='Q11768'>Egypt</pl> bribed a man to go down into the shrine of <prn id='Q79876'>Isis</prn> in <pl id='Q935454'>Coptus</pl>. The man despatched into the shrine returned indeed out of it, but after relating what he had seen, he too, so I was told, died immediately. So it appears that <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>'s verse speaks the truth when it says that it bodes no good to man to see godhead face to face. </p>
<p id='10.32.19'><b>10.32.19</b> The olive oil of <pl id='Q56697763'>Tithorea</pl> is less abundant than <pl id='Q122443'>Attic</pl> or <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyonian</pl> oil, but in color and pleasantness it surpasses <pl id='Q1203967'>Iberian</pl> oil and that from the island of <pl id='Q639912'>Istria</pl>. They distil all manner of unguents from the oil, and also send it to the Emperor. </p>
<p id='10.33.1'><b>10.33.1</b> Another road from <pl id='Q56697763'>Tithorea</pl> is the one that leads to <pl id='Q3807754'>Ledon</pl>. Once <pl id='Q3807754'>Ledon</pl> also was considered a city, but in my day the <pl id='Q3807754'>Ledontians</pl> owing to their weakness had abandoned the city, and the dwellers on the <pl id='Q1235405'>Cephisus</pl> were about seventy people. Still the name of <pl id='Q3807754'>Ledon</pl> is given to their dwellings, and the citizens, like the <pl id='Q2002148'>Panopeans</pl>, have the right to be represented at the general assembly of the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl>. The ruins of the ancient <pl id='Q3807754'>Ledon</pl> are forty stades farther up from these dwellers on the <pl id='Q1235405'>Cephisus</pl>. They say that the city took its name from an aboriginal. </p>
<p id='10.33.2'><b>10.33.2</b> Other cities have incurred incurable harm through the sin of their own citizens, hut <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl>'s ruin was complete when it fell through the outrage that <prn id='Q167646'>Alexander</prn> committed against <prn id='Q171839'>Menelaus</prn>, and <pl id='Q169460'>Miletus</pl> through the lack of control shown by <prn id='Q451426'>Histiaeus</prn>, and his passionate desire, now to possess the city in the land of the <pl id='Q3719711'>Edonians</pl>, now to be admitted to the councils of <prn id='Q44387'>Dareius</prn>, and now to go back to <pl id='Q620874'>Ionia</pl>. Again, <prn id='Q4484273'>Philomelus</prn> brought on the community of <pl id='Q3807754'>Ledon</pl> the punishment to be paid for the crime of his own impiety. </p>
<p id='10.33.3'><b>10.33.3</b> <pl id='Q1267602'>Lilaea</pl> is a winter day's journey distant from <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>; we estimated the length of the road, which goes across and down <pl id='Q105261'>Parnassus</pl>, to be one hundred and eighty stades. Even after their city had been restored, its inhabitants were fated to suffer a second disaster at the hands of the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl>. Besieged by <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q59734'>Demetrius</prn>, they made terms and surrendered, and a garrison was brought into the city, until a native of the city, whose name was <prn id='Q87193353'>Patron</prn>, united against the garrison those of the citizens who were of military age, conquered the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> in battle, and forced them to withdraw under a truce. In return for this good deed the <pl id='Q1267602'>Lilaeans</pl> dedicated his statue at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>. </p>
<p id='10.33.4'><b>10.33.4</b> In <pl id='Q1267602'>Lilaea</pl> are also a theater, an agora and baths. There is also a sanctuary of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, and one of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>. The images are standing, of <pl id='Q122443'>Attic</pl> workmanship, and of marble from the <pl id='Q1125206'>Pentelic</pl> quarries. They say that <prn id='Q460094'>Lilaea</prn> was one of the <prn id='Q182037'>Naides</prn>, as they are called, a daughter of the <pl id='Q1235405'>Cephisus</pl>, and that after this nymph the city was named. Here the river has its <pl id='Q38281069'>sources</pl>. </p>
<p id='10.33.5'><b>10.33.5</b> It is not always quiet when it rises from the ground, but it usually happens that at about mid-day it makes a noise as it wells up. You could compare the roar of the water to the bellowing of a <prn id='Q693690'>bull</prn>. <pl id='Q1267602'>Lilaea</pl> has a temperate climate in autumn, in summer, and in spring; but Mount <pl id='Q105261'>Parnassus</pl> prevents the winter from being correspondingly mild. </p>
<p id='10.33.6'><b>10.33.6</b> <pl id='Q15689549'>Charadra</pl> is twenty stades distant, situated on the top of a lofty crag. The inhabitants are badly off for water; their drinking water is the river CharadrusYY, and they have to go down about three stades to reach it. This river is a tributary of the <pl id='Q1235405'>Cephisus</pl>, and it seems to me that the town was named after the CharadrusYY. In the agora at <pl id='Q15689549'>Charadra</pl> are altars of Heroes, as they are called, said by some to be the <prn id='Q190103'>Dioscuri</prn>, by others to be local heroes. </p>
<p id='10.33.7'><b>10.33.7</b> The land beside the <pl id='Q1235405'>Cephisus</pl> is distinctly the best in <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl> for planting, sowing and pasture. This part of the district, too, is the one most under cultivation, so that there is a saying that the verse, “And they who dwelt beside the divine river <pl id='Q1235405'>Cephisus</pl>”, alludes, not to a city <pl id='Q15674594'>Parapotamii</pl> (Riverside), but to the farmers beside the <pl id='Q1235405'>Cephisus</pl>. </p>
<p id='10.33.8'><b>10.33.8</b> The saying, however, is at variance with the history of <prn id='Q26825'>Herodotus</prn> as well as with the records of victories at the <prn id='Q649128'>Pythian games</prn>. For the <prn id='Q649128'>Pythian games</prn> were first held by the <prn id='Q182875'>Amphictyons</prn>, and at this first meeting a <pl id='Q15674594'>Parapotamian</pl> of the name of <prn id='Q91121903'>Aechmeas</prn> won the prize in the boxing match for boys. Similarly <prn id='Q26825'>Herodotus</prn>, enumerating the cities that King <prn id='Q129165'>Xerxes</prn> burnt in <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl>, includes among them the city of <pl id='Q15674594'>Parapotamii</pl>. However, <pl id='Q15674594'>Parapotamii</pl> was not restored by the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> and <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotians</pl>, but the inhabitants, being poverty stricken and few in number, were distributed among the other cities. I found no ruins of <pl id='Q15674594'>Parapotamii</pl> left, nor is the site of the city remembered. </p>
<p id='10.33.9'><b>10.33.9</b> The road from <pl id='Q1267602'>Lilaea</pl> to <pl id='Q474840'>Amphicleia</pl> is sixty stades. The name of this <pl id='Q474840'>Amphicleia</pl> has been corrupted by the native inhabitants. <prn id='Q26825'>Herodotus</prn>, following the most ancient account, called it <pl id='Q474840'>Amphicaea</pl>; but the <prn id='Q182875'>Amphictyons</prn>, when they published their decree for the destruction of the cities in <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl>, gave it the name of <pl id='Q474840'>Amphicleia</pl>. The natives tell about it the following story. A certain chief, suspecting that enemies were plotting against his baby son, put the child in a vessel, and hid him in that part of the land where he knew there would be most security. Now a <prn id='Q18498'>wolf</prn> attacked the child, but a <prn id='Q2102'>serpent</prn> coiled itself round the vessel, and kept up a strict watch. </p>
<p id='10.33.10'><b>10.33.10</b> When the child's father came, supposing that the <prn id='Q2102'>serpent</prn> had purposed to attack the child, he threw his javelin, which killed the <prn id='Q2102'>serpent</prn> and his son as well. But being informed by the shepherds that he had killed the benefactor and protector of his child, he made one common pyre for both the <prn id='Q2102'>serpent</prn> and his son. Now they say that even today the place resembles a burning pyre, maintaining that after this <prn id='Q2102'>serpent</prn> the city was called Ophiteia. </p>
<p id='10.33.11'><b>10.33.11</b> They celebrate orgies, well worth seeing, in honor of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>, but there is no entrance to the adyton, nor have they any image that can be seen. The people of <pl id='Q474840'>Amphicleia</pl> say that this god is their prophet and their helper in disease. The diseases of the <pl id='Q474840'>Amphicleans</pl> themselves and of their neighbors are cured by means of dreams. The oracles of the god are given by the priest, who utters them when under the divine inspiration. </p>
<p id='10.33.12'><b>10.33.12</b> Fifteen stades away from <pl id='Q474840'>Amphicleia</pl> is <pl id='Q12885360'>Tithronium</pl>, lying on a plain. It contains nothing remarkable. From <pl id='Q12885360'>Tithronium</pl> it is twenty stades to <pl id='Q11917777'>Drymaea</pl>. At the place where this road joins at the <pl id='Q1235405'>Cephisus</pl> the straight road from <pl id='Q474840'>Amphicleia</pl> to <pl id='Q11917777'>Drymaea</pl>, the <pl id='Q12885360'>Tithronians</pl> have a grove and altars of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>. There has also been made a temple, but no image. <pl id='Q11917777'>Drymaea</pl> is eighty stades distant from <pl id='Q474840'>Amphicleia</pl>, on the left . . . according to the account in <prn id='Q26825'>Herodotus</prn>, but in earlier days Naubolenses. The inhabitants say that their founder was <prn id='Q106889991'>Naubolus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q3381352'>Phocus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q206187'>Aeacus</prn>. At <pl id='Q11917777'>Drymaea</pl> is an ancient sanctuary of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> <prn id='Q2401559'>Thesmophoros</prn> (Lawgiver), with a standing image made of stone. Every year they hold a feast in her honor, the <prn id='Q1029939'>Thesmophoria</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.34.1'><b>10.34.1</b> <pl id='Q1235347'>Elateia</pl> is, with the exception of <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>, the largest city in <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl>. It lies over against <pl id='Q474840'>Amphicleia</pl>, and the road to it from <pl id='Q474840'>Amphicleia</pl> is one hundred and eighty stades long, level for the most part, but with an upward gradient for a short distance quite close to the town of <pl id='Q1235347'>Elateia</pl>. In the plain flows the <pl id='Q1235405'>Cephisus</pl>, and the most common bird to live along its banks is the bustard. </p>
<p id='10.34.2'><b>10.34.2</b> The <pl id='Q1235347'>Elateans</pl> were successful in repelling the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonian</pl> army under <prn id='Q207183'>Cassander</prn>, and they managed to escape from the war that <prn id='Q2460883'>Taxilus</prn>, general of <prn id='Q185126'>Mithridates</prn>, brought against them. In return for this deed the Romans have given them the privilege of living in the country free and immune from taxation. They claim to be of foreign stock, saying that of old they came from <pl id='Q12898802'>Arcadia</pl>. For they say that when the <prn id='Q18629873'>Phlegyans</prn> marched against the sanctuary at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>, <prn id='Q1325009'>Elatus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q606422'>Arcas</prn>, came to the assistance of the god, and with his army stayed behind in <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl>, becoming the founder of <pl id='Q1235347'>Elateia</pl>. </p>
<p id='10.34.3'><b>10.34.3</b> <pl id='Q1235347'>Elateia</pl> must be numbered among the cities of the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> burnt by the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl>. Some disasters were shared by <pl id='Q1235347'>Elateia</pl> with the other <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl>, but she had peculiar calamities of her own, inflicted by fate at the hands of the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl>. In the war waged by <prn id='Q207183'>Cassander</prn>, it is <prn id='Q1659401'>Olympiodorus</prn> who must receive most credit for the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> being forced to abandon a siege. <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q59734'>Demetrius</prn>, reduced the people of <pl id='Q1235347'>Elateia</pl> to the utmost terror, and at the same time seduced by bribery the more powerful of the citizens. </p>
<p id='10.34.4'><b>10.34.4</b> <prn id='Q349222'>Titus</prn>, the Roman magistrate, who had a commission from <pl id='Q18287233'>Rome</pl> to give all Greeks their freedom, promised to give back to <pl id='Q1235347'>Elateia</pl> its ancient constitution, and by messengers made overtures to its citizens to secede from <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonia</pl>. But either they or their government were stupid enough to be faithful to <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn>, and the Romans reduced them by siege. Later on the <pl id='Q1235347'>Elateans</pl> held out when besieged by the barbarians of <pl id='Q621672'>Pontus</pl> under the command of <prn id='Q2460883'>Taxilus</prn>, the general of <prn id='Q185126'>Mithridates</prn>. As a reward for this deed the Romans gave them their freedom. </p>
<p id='10.34.5'><b>10.34.5</b> An army of bandits, called the <prn id='Q869369'>Costobocs</prn>, who overran Greece in my day, visited among other cities <pl id='Q1235347'>Elateia</pl>. Whereupon a certain <prn id='Q21710777'>Mnesibulus</prn> gathered round him a company of men and put to the sword many of the barbarians, but he himself fell in the fighting. This <prn id='Q21710777'>Mnesibulus</prn> won several prizes for running, among which were prizes for the foot-race, and for the double race with shield, at the two hundred and thirty-fifth <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> festival. In Runner Street at <pl id='Q1235347'>Elateia</pl> there stands a bronze statue of <prn id='Q21710777'>Mnesibulus</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.34.6'><b>10.34.6</b> The agora itself is worth seeing, and so is the figure of <prn id='Q1325009'>Elatus</prn> carved in relief upon a stele. I do not know for certain whether they made the slab to honor him as their founder or also to serve as a gravestone to his tomb. A temple has been built to <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn>, with a bearded image of the god. The names of the makers of the image are <prn id='Q11951868'>Timocles</prn> and <prn id='Q11951894'>Timarchides</prn>, artists of <pl id='Q122443'>Attic</pl> birth. At the end of the city on the right is a theater, and an ancient bronze image of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>. They say that this goddess helped them against the barbarians under <prn id='Q2460883'>Taxilus</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.34.7'><b>10.34.7</b> About twenty stades away from <pl id='Q1235347'>Elateia</pl> is a <pl id='Q38280358'>sanctuary</pl> of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> surnamed <prn id='Q58837211'>Cranaea</prn>. The road to it slopes upwards, but so gentle is the ascent that it causes no fatigue — in fact one scarcely notices it. At the end of the road is a hill which, though for the most part precipitous, is neither very large nor very high. On this hill the sanctuary has been built, with porticoes and dwellings through them, where live those whose duty it is to wait on the god, chief of whom is the priest. </p>
<p id='10.34.8'><b>10.34.8</b> They choose the priest from boys who have not yet reached the age of puberty, taking care beforehand that his term of office shall run out before puberty arrives. The office lasts for five successive years, during which the priest boards with the goddess, and bathes in tubs after the ancient manner. This image too was made by the sons of <prn id='Q3286930'>Polycles</prn>. It is armed as for battle, and on the shield is wrought in relief a copy of what at <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> is wrought on the shield of her whom the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> call Parthenos. </p>
<p id='10.35.1'><b>10.35.1</b> To reach <pl id='Q304823'>Abae</pl> and <pl id='Q1534902'>Hyampolis</pl> from <pl id='Q1235347'>Elateia</pl> you may go along a mountain road on the right of the city of <pl id='Q1235347'>Elateia</pl>, but the highway from <pl id='Q543895'>Orchomenus</pl> to <pl id='Q771434'>Opus</pl> also leads to those cities. If then you go along the road from <pl id='Q543895'>Orchomenus</pl> to <pl id='Q771434'>Opus</pl>, and turn off a little to the left, you reach the road to <pl id='Q304823'>Abae</pl>. The people of <pl id='Q304823'>Abae</pl> say that they came to <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl> from <pl id='Q13533353'>Argos</pl>, and that the city got its name from <prn id='Q305607'>Abas</prn>, the founder, who was a son of <prn id='Q7877819'>Lynceus</prn> and of <prn id='Q472784'>Hypermestra</prn>, the daughter of <prn id='Q210883'>Danaus</prn>. <pl id='Q304823'>Abae</pl> from of old has been considered sacred to <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, and here too there was an <pl id='Q38281622'>oracle</pl> of that god. </p>
<p id='10.35.2'><b>10.35.2</b> The treatment that the god at <pl id='Q38281622'>Abae</pl> received at the hands of the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persians</pl> was very different from the honor paid him by the Romans. For while the Romans have given freedom of government to <pl id='Q304823'>Abae</pl> because of their reverence for <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, the army of <prn id='Q129165'>Xerxes</prn> burned down, as it did others, the sanctuary at <pl id='Q38281622'>Abae</pl>. The Greeks who opposed the barbarians resolved not to rebuild the sanctuaries burnt down by them, but to leave them for all time as memorials of their hatred. This too is the reason why the temples in the territory of <pl id='Q359627'>Haliartus</pl>, as well as the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> temples of <prn id='Q38012'>Hera</prn> on the road to <pl id='Q534927'>Phalerum</pl> and of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> at <pl id='Q534927'>Phalerum</pl>, still remain half-burnt even at the present day. </p>
<p id='10.35.3'><b>10.35.3</b> Such, I suppose, was the appearance of the sanctuary at <pl id='Q38281622'>Abae</pl> also, after the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl> invasion, until in the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocian</pl> war some <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl>, overcome in battle, took refuge in <pl id='Q38281622'>Abae</pl>. Whereupon the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> gave them to the flames, and with the refugees the sanctuary, which was thus burnt down a second time. However, it still stood even in my time, the frailest of buildings ever damaged by fire, seeing that the ruin begun by the <pl id='Q3746183'>Persian</pl> incendiaries was completed by the incendiaries of <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl>. </p>
<p id='10.35.4'><b>10.35.4</b> Beside the large temple there is another, but smaller in size, made for <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> by the emperor <prn id='Q1427'>Hadrian</prn>. The images are of earlier date, being dedicated by the <pl id='Q304823'>Abaeans</pl> themselves; they are made of bronze, and all alike are standing, <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, <prn id='Q103107'>Leto</prn> and <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>. At <pl id='Q304823'>Abae</pl> there is a theater, and also an agora, both of ancient construction. </p>
<p id='10.35.5'><b>10.35.5</b> Returning to the straight road to <pl id='Q771434'>Opus</pl>, you come next to <pl id='Q1534902'>Hyampolis</pl>. Its mere name tells you who the inhabitants originally were, and the place from which they were expelled when they came to this land. For it was the <prn id='Q15618315'>Hyantes</prn> of <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebes</pl> who came here when they fled from <prn id='Q27613'>Cadmus</prn> and his army. In earlier times the city was called by its neighbors the city of the Hyantes, but in course of time the name of <pl id='Q1534902'>Hyampolis</pl> prevailed over the other. </p>
<p id='10.35.6'><b>10.35.6</b> Although <prn id='Q129165'>Xerxes</prn> had burnt down the city, and afterwards <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn> had razed it to the ground, nevertheless there were left the structure of an old agora, a council-chamber (a building of no great size) and a theater not far from the gates. The emperor <prn id='Q1427'>Hadrian</prn> built a stoa, which bears the name of the emperor who dedicated it. The citizens have one well only. This is their sole supply, both for drinking and for washing; from no other source can they get water, save only from the winter rains. </p>
<p id='10.35.7'><b>10.35.7</b> Above all other divinities they worship <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, of whom they have a temple. The image of her I cannot describe, for their rule is to open the sanctuary twice, and not more often, every year. They say that whatever <prn id='Q830'>cattle</prn> they consecrate to <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> grow up immune to disease and fatter than other <prn id='Q830'>cattle</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.35.8'><b>10.35.8</b> [NEW ITINERARY] The straight road to <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> that leads through <pl id='Q2002148'>Panopeus</pl> and past <pl id='Q1172948'>Daulis</pl> and the Cleft Way, is not the only pass from <pl id='Q13574678'>Chaeroneia</pl> to <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl>. There is another road, rough and for the most part mountainous, that leads from <pl id='Q13574678'>Chaeroneia</pl> to the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocian</pl> city of <pl id='Q12884846'>Stiris</pl>. The length of the road is one hundred and twenty stades. The inhabitants assert that by descent they are not <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocian</pl>, but <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl>, and that they came from <pl id='Q122443'>Attica</pl> with <prn id='Q2551733'>Peteus</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q1985130'>Orneus</prn>, when he was pursued from <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> by <prn id='Q191725'>Aegeus</prn>. They add that, because the greater part of those who accompanied <prn id='Q2551733'>Peteus</prn> came from the deme of <pl id='Q2341881'>Stiria</pl>, the city received the name of <pl id='Q12884846'>Stiris</pl>. </p>
<p id='10.35.9'><b>10.35.9</b> The people of <pl id='Q12884846'>Stiris</pl> have their dwellings on a high and rocky site. For this reason they suffer from a shortage of water in summer; the wells are few, and the water is bad that they supply. These wells give washing-water to the people and drinking-water to the beasts of burden, but for their own drinking water the people go down about four stades and draw it from a spring. The spring is in a hole dug into the rocks, and they go down to it to fetch water. </p>
<p id='10.35.10'><b>10.35.10</b> In <pl id='Q12884846'>Stiris</pl> is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn> surnamed StiriaYY. It is of unburnt brick; the image is of <pl id='Q1125206'>Pentelic</pl> marble, and the goddess is holding torches. Beside her, bound with ribbons, is an image of <prn id='Q40730'>Demeter</prn>, as ancient as any of that goddess that exists. </p>
<p id='10.36.1'><b>10.36.1</b> From <pl id='Q12884846'>Stiris</pl> to <pl id='Q12872250'>Ambrossus</pl> is about six stades. The road is flat, lying on the level with mountains on both sides of it. The greater part of the plain is covered with vines, and in the territory of <pl id='Q12872250'>Ambrossus</pl> grow shrubs, though not close together like the vines. This shrub the <prn id='Q465331'>Ionians</prn>, as well as the rest of the Greeks, call kokkos, and the Gauls above <pl id='Q32579'>Phrygia</pl> call it in their native speech hys. This kokkos grows to the size of what is called the rhamnos; the leaves are darker and softer than those of the mastich-tree, though in other respects the two are alike. </p>
<p id='10.36.2'><b>10.36.2</b> Its fruit is like the fruit of the nightshade, and its size is about that of the bitter vetch. There breeds in the fruit of the kokkos a small creature. If this should reach the air when the fruit has ripened, it becomes in appearance like a gnat, and immediately flies away. But as it is they gather the fruit of the kokkos before the creature begins to move, and the blood of the creature serves as a dye for wool. </p>
<p id='10.36.3'><b>10.36.3</b> <pl id='Q12872250'>Ambrossus</pl> lies at the foot of Mount <pl id='Q105261'>Parnassus</pl>, on the side opposite to <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>. They say that the city was named after <prn id='Q91109436'>Ambrossus</prn>, a hero. On going to war with <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn> and his <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonians</pl> the <pl id='Q11225429'>Thebans</pl> drew round <pl id='Q12872250'>Ambrossus</pl> a double wall. It is made of a local stone, black in color and very hard indeed. Each ring of wall is a little less than a fathom broad, and two and a half fathoms in height except where it has broken down. </p>
<p id='10.36.4'><b>10.36.4</b> The interval between the first ring and the second is a fathom. The building of towers, of battlements, or of any ornament, has been entirely neglected, as the only object the citizens had in constructing the walls was immediate protection. There is a small agora at <pl id='Q12872250'>Ambrossus</pl>, and of the stone statues set up in it most are broken. </p>
<p id='10.36.5'><b>10.36.5</b> The road to <pl id='Q4774674'>Anticyra</pl> is at first up-hill. About two stades up the slope is a level place, and on the right of the road is a sanctuary of Artemis surnamed <prn id='Q59876725'>Dictynnaean</prn>, a goddess worshipped with great reverence by the <pl id='Q12872250'>Ambrossans</pl>. The image is of <pl id='Q191082'>Aeginetan</pl> workmanship, and made of a black stone. From the sanctuary of the Dictynnaean goddess the road is downhill all the way to <pl id='Q4774674'>Anticyra</pl>. They say that in days of old the name of the city was <pl id='Q106485600'>Cyparissus</pl>, and that <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn> in the list of <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> was determined to call it by this name, although it was called <pl id='Q4774674'>Anticyra</pl> in <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>'s day, because <prn id='Q21548735'>Anticyreus</prn> was a contemporary of <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.36.6'><b>10.36.6</b> The city lies over against the ruins of <pl id='Q12771305'>Medeon</pl>. I have mentioned in the beginning of my account of <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl> that the people of <pl id='Q4774674'>Anticyra</pl> were guilty of sacrilege against the sanctuary at <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>. They were driven from home by <prn id='Q130650'>Philip</prn>, son of <prn id='Q313907'>Amyntas</prn>, and yet once more by the Roman <prn id='Q91121881'>Otilius</prn>, because they were subjects of the <pl id='Q81734'>Macedonian</pl> king <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn>, son of <prn id='Q59734'>Demetrius</prn>. <prn id='Q91121881'>Otilius</prn> had been despatched from <pl id='Q18287233'>Rome</pl> to help the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> against <prn id='Q237248'>Philip</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.36.7'><b>10.36.7</b> The mountains beyond <pl id='Q4774674'>Anticyra</pl> are very rocky, and on them grows hellebore in great profusion. Black hellebore sends those who take it to stool, and purges the bowels; the nature of the other, the white kind, is to purge by vomiting. It is the root of the hellebore which is used as a purging drug. </p>
<p id='10.36.8'><b>10.36.8</b> In the agora at <pl id='Q4774674'>Anticyra</pl> are bronze statues, and at the harbor is a small sanctuary of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, built of unhewn stones. The inside is covered with stucco. The image, which is made of bronze, is a standing figure, with one foot resting on a <prn id='Q7369'>dolphin</prn>. On this side he has one hand upon his thigh; in his other hand is a trident. </p>
<p id='10.36.9'><b>10.36.9</b> Opposite the gymnasium, in which the baths have been made, is another gymnasium, an old one, in which stands a bronze statue. The inscription on it says that <prn id='Q21716131'>Xenodamus</prn> of <pl id='Q4774674'>Anticyra</pl>, a pancratiast, won an <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> victory in the match for men. If the inscription speaks the truth, it would seem that <prn id='Q21716131'>Xenodamus</prn> received the wild olive at the two hundred and eleventh <pl id='Q38888'>Olympic</pl> festival. But this is the only festival omitted in the <pl id='Q6536845'>Elean</pl> records. </p>
<p id='10.36.10'><b>10.36.10</b> Beyond the agora there is in a well a spring of water. Over the well there is a roof to shelter it from the sun, with columns to support the roof. A little higher up than the well is a tomb built of any stones that came to hand. Here they say are buried the sons of <prn id='Q2731769'>Iphitus</prn>; one returned safe from <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl> and died in his native land; the other, <prn id='Q17282472'>Schedius</prn>, died, they say, in the <pl id='Q2454671'>Troad</pl>, but his bones also were brought home. </p>
<p id='10.37.1'><b>10.37.1</b> About two stades off the city there is, on the right, a high rock, which forms part of a mountain, with a sanctuary of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> built upon it. The image of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> is one of the works of <prn id='Q105290'>Praxiteles</prn>; she carries a torch in her right hand and a quiver over her shoulders, while at her left side there is a <prn id='Q144'>dog</prn>. The image is taller than the tallest woman. </p>
<p id='10.37.2'><b>10.37.2</b> Bordering on the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocian</pl> territory is a land named after <prn id='Q91121927'>Boulon</prn>, the leader of the colony, which was founded by a union of emigrants from the cities in ancient <pl id='Q130987'>Doris</pl>. The <pl id='Q895095'>Boulians</pl> are said of <prn id='Q4484273'>Philomelus</prn> and the <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocians</pl> . . . the general assembly. To <pl id='Q895095'>Boulis</pl> from <pl id='Q57374186'>Thisbe</pl> in <pl id='Q187570'>Boeotia</pl> is a journey of eighty stades; but I do not know if in <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl> there be a road by land at all from <pl id='Q4774674'>Anticyra</pl>, so rough and difficult to cross are the mountains between <pl id='Q4774674'>Anticyra</pl> and <pl id='Q895095'>Boulis</pl>. To the harbor from <pl id='Q4774674'>Anticyra</pl> is a sail of one hundred stades, and the road by land from the harbor to <pl id='Q895095'>Boulis</pl> we conjectured to be about seven stades long. </p>
<p id='10.37.3'><b>10.37.3</b> Here a torrent falls into the sea, called by the natives Heracleius. <pl id='Q895095'>Boulis</pl> lies on high ground, and it is passed by travellers crossing by sea from <pl id='Q4774674'>Anticyra</pl> to <pl id='Q1811299'>Lechaeum</pl> in <pl id='Q1363688'>Corinthian</pl> territory. More than half its inhabitants are fishers of the shell-fish that gives the purple dye. The buildings in <pl id='Q895095'>Boulis</pl> are not very wonderful; among them is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> and one of <prn id='Q41680'>Dionysus</prn>. The images are made of wood, but we were unable to judge who was the artist. The god worshipped most by the <pl id='Q895095'>Boulians</pl> is named by them the Greatest, a surname, I should think, of <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn>. At <pl id='Q895095'>Boulis</pl> there is a spring called Saunium. </p>
<p id='10.37.4'><b>10.37.4</b> The length of the road from <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> to <pl id='Q56754242'>Cirrha</pl>, the port of <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>, is sixty stades. Descending to the plain you come to a <pl id='Q106484612'>race-course</pl>, where at the <prn id='Q649128'>Pythian games</prn> the <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn> compete. I have told in my account of <pl id='Q217667'>Elis</pl> the story of the <prn id='Q770627'>Taraxippus</prn> at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>, and it is likely that the <pl id='Q106484612'>race-course</pl> of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> too may possibly harm here and there a driver, for heaven in every activity of man bestows either better fortune or worse. But the <pl id='Q106484612'>race-course</pl> itself is not of a nature to startle the <prn id='Q726'>horses</prn>, either by reason of a hero or on any other account. </p>
<p id='10.37.5'><b>10.37.5</b> The plain from <pl id='Q56754242'>Cirrha</pl> is altogether bare, and the inhabitants will not plant trees, either because the land is under a curse, or because they know that the ground is useless for growing trees. It is said that to <pl id='Q56754242'>Cirrha</pl> . . . and they say that from <prn id='Q105821057'>Cirrha</prn> the place received its modern name. <prn id='Q6691'>Homer</prn>, however, in the <prn id='Q8275'>Iliad</prn>, and similarly in the hymn to <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, calls the city by its ancient name of <pl id='Q4241204'>Crisa</pl>. Afterwards the people of <pl id='Q56754242'>Cirrha</pl> behaved wickedly towards <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>; especially in appropriating some of the god's land. </p>
<p id='10.37.6'><b>10.37.6</b> So the <prn id='Q182875'>Amphictyons</prn> determined to make war on the <pl id='Q56754242'>Cirrhaeans</pl>, put <prn id='Q207634'>Cleisthenes</prn>, tyrant of <pl id='Q368628'>Sicyon</pl>, at the head of their army, and brought over <prn id='Q133337'>Solon</prn> from <pl id='Q844930'>Athens</pl> to give them advice. They asked the oracle about victory, and the <prn id='Q220344'>Pythian priestess</prn> replied: <br>“You will not take and throw down the tower of this city, <br>Until on my precinct shall dash the wave <br>Of blue-eyed <prn id='Q180222'>Amphitrite</prn>, roaring over the winedark sea.” <br>So <prn id='Q133337'>Solon</prn> induced them to consecrate to the god the territory of <pl id='Q56754242'>Cirrha</pl>, in order that the sea might become neighbor to the precinct of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.37.7'><b>10.37.7</b> <prn id='Q133337'>Solon</prn> invented another trick to outwit the <pl id='Q56754242'>Cirrhaeans</pl>. The water of the river <pl id='Q3537166'>Pleistus</pl> ran along a channel to the city, and <prn id='Q133337'>Solon</prn> diverted it in another direction. When the <pl id='Q56754242'>Cirrhaeans</pl> still held out against the besiegers, drinking well-water and rain-water, <prn id='Q133337'>Solon</prn> threw into the <pl id='Q3537166'>Pleistus</pl> roots of hellebore, and when he perceived that water held enough of the drug he diverted it back again into its channel. The <pl id='Q56754242'>Cirrhaeans</pl> drank without stint of the water, and those on the wall, seized with obstinate diarrhoea, deserted their posts, </p>
<p id='10.37.8'><b>10.37.8</b> and the <prn id='Q182875'>Amphictyons</prn> captured the city. They exacted punishment from the <pl id='Q56754242'>Cirrhaeans</pl> on behalf of the god, and <pl id='Q56754242'>Cirrha</pl> is the port of <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl>. Its notable sights include a temple of <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn>, <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> and <prn id='Q103107'>Leto</prn>, with very large images of <pl id='Q122443'>Attic</pl> workmanship. <prn id='Q16737262'>Adrasteia</prn> has been set up by the <pl id='Q56754242'>Cirrhaeans</pl> in the same place, but she is not so large as the other images. </p>
<p id='10.38.1'><b>10.38.1</b> The territory of the <pl id='Q4894785'>Locrians</pl> called <pl id='Q4894785'>Ozolian</pl> adjoins <pl id='Q2637650'>Phocis</pl> opposite <pl id='Q56754242'>Cirrha</pl>. I have heard various stories about the surname of these <pl id='Q4894785'>Locrians</pl>, all of which I will tell my readers. <prn id='Q43891313'>Orestheus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q207715'>Deucalion</prn>, king of the land, had a <prn id='Q39266'>bitch</prn> that gave birth to a stick instead of a <prn id='Q39266'>puppy</prn>. <prn id='Q43891313'>Orestheus</prn> buried the stick, and in the spring, it is said, a vine grew from it, and from the branches (ozoi) of the stick the people got their name. </p>
<p id='10.38.2'><b>10.38.2</b> Others believe that <prn id='Q466866'>Nessus</prn>, ferrying on the <pl id='Q522489'>Evenus</pl>, was wounded by <prn id='Q122248'>Heracles</prn>, but not killed on the spot, making his escape to this country; when he died his body rotted unburied, imparting a foul stench to the atmosphere of the place. The third story says that the exhalations from a certain river, and its very water, have a peculiar smell; the fourth, that asphodel grows in great abundance and when in flower . . . because of the smell. </p>
<p id='10.38.3'><b>10.38.3</b> Another story says that the first dwellers here were aboriginals, but as yet not knowing how to weave garments they used to make themselves a protection against the cold out of the untanned skins of beasts, turning outwards the shaggy side of the skins for the sake of a good appearance. So their own skins were sure to smell as badly as did the hides. </p>
<p id='10.38.4'><b>10.38.4</b> One hundred and twenty stades away from <pl id='Q682558'>Delphi</pl> is <pl id='Q38281545'>Amphissa</pl>, the largest and most renowned city of <pl id='Q4894785'>Locris</pl>. The people hold that they are <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolians</pl>, being ashamed of the name of <pl id='Q4894785'>Ozolians</pl>. Support is given to this view by the fact that, when the Roman emperor drove the <pl id='Q26857'>Aetolians</pl> from their homes in order to found the new city of <pl id='Q943637'>Nicopolis</pl>, the greater part of the people went away to <pl id='Q38281545'>Amphissa</pl>. Originally, however, they came of <pl id='Q4894785'>Locrian</pl> race. It is said that the name of the city is derived from <prn id='Q2322495'>Amphissa</prn>, daughter of <prn id='Q9026462'>Macar</prn>, son of <prn id='Q406388'>Aeolus</prn>, and that <prn id='Q37340'>Apollo</prn> was her lover. </p>
<p id='10.38.5'><b>10.38.5</b> The city is beautifully constructed, and its most notable objects are the tomb of <prn id='Q2322495'>Amphissa</prn> and the tomb of <prn id='Q16335866'>Andraemon</prn>. With him was buried, they say, his wife <prn id='Q1538212'>Gorge</prn>, daughter of <prn id='Q749966'>Oeneus</prn>. On the acropolis of <pl id='Q38281545'>Amphissa</pl> is a temple of <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn>, with a standing image of bronze, brought, they say, from <pl id='Q22647'>Troy</pl> by <prn id='Q1367871'>Thoas</prn>, being part of the spoils of that city. But I cannot accept the story. </p>
<p id='10.38.6'><b>10.38.6</b> For I have stated in an earlier part of my work that two <pl id='Q13580795'>Samians</pl>, <prn id='Q1851693'>Rhoecus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q1615450'>Philaeus</prn>, and <prn id='Q3286634'>Theodorus</prn>, son of <prn id='Q2706119'>Telecles</prn>, discovered how to found bronze most perfectly, and were the first casters of that metal. I have found extant no work of <prn id='Q3286634'>Theodorus</prn>, at least no work of bronze. But in the sanctuary of <pl id='Q43018'>Ephesian</pl> <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn>, as you enter the building containing the pictures, there is a stone wall above the altar of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> called <prn id='Q20182551'>Protothronia</prn> (of the First Seat). Among the images that stand upon the wall is a statue of a woman at the end, a work of <prn id='Q1851693'>Rhoecus</prn>, called by the <pl id='Q47611'>Ephesians</pl> <prn id='Q131203'>Night</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.38.7'><b>10.38.7</b> A mere glance shows that this image is older, and of rougher workmanship, than the <prn id='Q37122'>Athena</prn> in <pl id='Q38281545'>Amphissa</pl>. The <pl id='Q38281545'>Amphissians</pl> also celebrate mysteries in honor of the <prn id='Q91109437'>Anaktes</prn> (Boy Kings), as they are called. Their accounts as to who of the gods the Boy Kings are do not agree; some say they are the <prn id='Q190103'>Dioscuri</prn>, others the <prn id='Q247617'>Curetes</prn>, and others, who pretend to have fuller knowledge, hold them to be the <prn id='Q940138'>Cabeiri</prn>. </p>
<p id='10.38.8'><b>10.38.8</b> These <pl id='Q4894785'>Locrians</pl> also possess the following cities. Farther inland from <pl id='Q38281545'>Amphissa</pl>, and above it, is <pl id='Q2358920'>Myonia</pl>, thirty stades distant from it. They are the <pl id='Q2358920'>Myanes</pl> who dedicated the shield to <prn id='Q34201'>Zeus</prn> at <pl id='Q38888'>Olympia</pl>. The town lies upon a height, and it has a grove and an altar of the Gracious Gods (Theoi <prn id='Q1637673'>Meilichioi</prn>). The sacrifices to the <prn id='Q1637673'>Meilichioi</prn> are offered at night, and their rule is to consume the meat on the spot before sunrise. Beyond the city is a precinct of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn>, called Poseidonium, and a temple of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> is in it. But the image had disappeared before my time. </p>
<p id='10.38.9'><b>10.38.9</b> These, then, live above <pl id='Q38281545'>Amphissa</pl>. On the coast is <pl id='Q5850148'>Oeantheia</pl>, neighbor to which is <pl id='Q782278'>Naupactus</pl>. The others, but not <pl id='Q38281545'>Amphissa</pl>, are under the government of the <pl id='Q2790451'>Achaeans</pl> of <pl id='Q133123'>Patrae</pl>, the emperor <prn id='Q1405'>Augustus</prn> having granted them this privilege. In <pl id='Q5850148'>Oeantheia</pl> is a sanctuary of <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn>, and a little beyond the city there is a grove of cypress-trees mixed with pines; in the grove is a temple of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> with an image. The paintings on the walls I found had lost their color with time, and nothing of them was still left worth seeing. </p>
<p id='10.38.10'><b>10.38.10</b> I gather that the city got its name from a woman or a nymph, while as for <pl id='Q782278'>Naupactus</pl>, I have heard it said that the <prn id='Q203711'>Dorians</prn> under the sons of <prn id='Q311536'>Aristomachus</prn> built here the vessels in which they crossed to the <pl id='Q78967'>Peloponnesus</pl>, thus, it is said, giving to the place its name. My account of <pl id='Q782278'>Naupactus</pl>, how the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenians</pl> took it from the <pl id='Q4894785'>Locrians</pl> and gave it as a home to those who seceded to <pl id='Q602538'>Ithome</pl> at the time of the earthquake at <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemon</pl>, and how, after the <pl id='Q844930'>Athenian</pl> disaster at <pl id='Q404513'>Aegospotami</pl>, the <pl id='Q5690'>Lacedemonians</pl> expelled the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> from <pl id='Q782278'>Naupactus</pl>, all this I have fully related in my history of <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenia</pl>. When the <pl id='Q1247159'>Messenians</pl> were forced to leave, the <pl id='Q4894785'>Locrians</pl> gathered again at <pl id='Q782278'>Naupactus</pl>. </p>
<p id='10.38.11'><b>10.38.11</b> The epic poem called the <prn id='Q3337166'>Naupactia</prn> by the Greeks is by most people assigned to a poet of <pl id='Q169460'>Miletus</pl>, while <prn id='Q658260'>Charon</prn>, the son of <prn id='Q16327666'>Pythes</prn>, says that it is a composition of <prn id='Q2938009'>Carcinus</prn> of <pl id='Q782278'>Naupactus</pl>. I am one of those who agree with the <pl id='Q1229422'>Lampsacenian</pl> writer. For what reason could there be in giving the name of <prn id='Q3337166'>Naupactia</prn> to a poem about women composed by an author of <pl id='Q169460'>Miletus</pl>? </p>
<p id='10.38.12'><b>10.38.12</b> Here there is on the coast a temple of <prn id='Q41127'>Poseidon</prn> with a standing image made of bronze; there is also a sanctuary of <prn id='Q39503'>Artemis</prn> with an image of white marble. She is in the attitude of one hurling a javelin, and is surnamed <prn id='Q21548080'>Aetole</prn>. In a cave <prn id='Q35500'>Aphrodite</prn> is worshipped, to whom prayers are offered for various reasons, and especially by widows who ask the goddess to grant them marriage. </p>
<p id='10.38.13'><b>10.38.13</b> The sanctuary of <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> I found in ruins, but it was originally built by a private person called <prn id='Q91121101'>Phalysius</prn>. For he had a complaint of the eyes, and when he was almost blind the god at <pl id='Q7698713'>Epidaurus</pl> sent to him the poetess <prn id='Q241120'>Anyte</prn>, who brought with her a sealed tablet. The woman thought that the god's appearance was a dream, but it proved at once to be a waking vision. For she found in her own hands a sealed tablet; so sailing to <pl id='Q782278'>Naupactus</pl> she bade <prn id='Q91121101'>Phalysius</prn> take away the seal and read what was written. He did not think it possible to read the writing with his eyes in such a condition, but hoping to get some benefit from <prn id='Q83223'>Asclepius</prn> he took away the seal. When he had looked at the wax he recovered his sight, and gave to <prn id='Q241120'>Anyte</prn> what was written on the tablet, two thousand staters of gold. </p>
